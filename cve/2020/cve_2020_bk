lambdaisland/uri is a pure Clojure/ClojureScript URI library. In
versions prior to 1.14.120 `authority-regex` allows an attacker to
send malicious URLs to be parsed by the `lambdaisland/uri` and return
the wrong authority. This issue is similar to but distinct from
CVE-2020-8910. The regex in question doesn't handle the backslash
(`\`) character in the username correctly, leading to a wrong output.
ex. a payload of `https://example.com\\@google.com` would return that
the host is `google.com`, but the correct host should be
`example.com`. Given that the library returns the wrong authority this
may be abused to bypass host restrictions depending on how the library
is used in an application. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this vulnerability.

GoCD is an open source continuous delivery server. GoCD versions
before 23.1.0 are vulnerable to a stored XSS vulnerability, where
pipeline configuration with a malicious pipeline label configuration
can affect browser display of pipeline runs generated from that
configuration. An attacker that has permissions to configure GoCD
pipelines could include JavaScript elements within the label template,
causing a XSS vulnerability to be triggered for any users viewing the
Value Stream Map or Job Details for runs of the affected pipeline,
potentially allowing them to perform arbitrary actions within the
victim's browser context rather than their own. This issue has been

GoCD is an open source continuous delivery server. In GoCD versions
from 20.5.0 and below 23.1.0, if the server environment is not
correctly configured by administrators to provide access to the
relevant PostgreSQL or MySQL backup tools, the credentials for
database access may be unintentionally leaked to admin alerts on the
GoCD user interface. The vulnerability is triggered only if the GoCD
server host is misconfigured to have backups enabled, but does not
have access to the `pg_dump` or `mysqldump` utility tools to backup
the configured database type (PostgreSQL or MySQL respectively). In
such cases, failure to launch the expected backup utility reports the
shell environment used to attempt to launch in the server admin alert,
which includes the plaintext database password supplied to the
configured tool. This vulnerability does not affect backups of the
default on-disk H2 database that GoCD is configured to use. This issue
has been addressed and fixed in GoCD 23.1.0. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable backups, or
administrators should ensure that the required `pg_dump` (PostgreSQL)
or `mysqldump` (MySQL) binaries are available on the GoCD server when
backups are triggered.

comrak is a CommonMark + GFM compatible Markdown parser and renderer
written in rust. A Comrak AST can be constructed manually by a program
instead of parsing a Markdown document with `parse_document`. This AST
can then be converted to HTML via
`html::format_document_with_plugins`. However, the HTML formatting
code assumes that the AST is well-formed. For example, many AST notes
contain `[u8]` fields which the formatting code assumes is valid UTF-8
data. Several bugs can be triggered if this is not the case. Version
0.17.0 contains adjustments to the AST, storing strings instead of
unvalidated byte arrays. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
upgrade may manually validate UTF-8 correctness of all data when
assigning to `&[u8]` and `Vec<u8>` fields in the AST. This issue is
also tracked as `GHSL-2023-049`.

vantage6 is privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure.
Prior to version 4.0.0, malicious users may try to get access to
resources they are not allowed to see, by creating resources with
integers as names. One example where this is a risk, is when users
define which users are allowed to run algorithms on their node. This
may be defined by username or user id. Now, for example, if user id 13
is allowed to run tasks, and an attacker creates a username with
username '13', they would be wrongly allowed to run an algorithm.
There may also be other places in the code where such a mixup of
resource ID or name leads to issues. Version 4.0.0 contains a patch
for this issue. The best solution is to check when resources are
created or modified, that the resource name always starts with a
character.

Snappier is a high performance C# implementation of the Snappy
compression algorithm. This is a buffer overrun vulnerability that can
affect any user of Snappier 1.1.0. In this release, much of the code
was rewritten to use byte references rather than pointers to pinned
buffers. This change generally improves performance and reduces
workload on the garbage collector. However, when the garbage collector
performs compaction and rearranges memory, it must update any byte
references on the stack to refer to the updated location. The .NET
garbage collector can only update these byte references if they still
point within the buffer or to a point one byte past the end of the
buffer. If they point outside this area, the buffer itself may be
moved while the byte reference stays the same. There are several
places in 1.1.0 where byte references very briefly point outside the
valid areas of buffers. These are at locations in the code being used
for buffer range checks. While the invalid references are never
dereferenced directly, if a GC compaction were to occur during the
brief window when they are on the stack then it could invalidate the
buffer range check and allow other operations to overrun the buffer.
This should be very difficult for an attacker to trigger
intentionally. It would require a repetitive bulk attack with the hope
that a GC compaction would occur at precisely the right moment during
one of the requests. However, one of the range checks with this
problem is a check based on input data in the decompression buffer,
meaning malformed input data could be used to increase the chance of
success. Note that any resulting buffer overrun is likely to cause
access to protected memory, which will then cause an exception and the
process to be terminated. Therefore, the most likely result of an
attack is a denial of service. This issue has been patched in release
1.1.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may pin
buffers to a fixed location before using them for compression or
decompression to mitigate some, but not all, of these cases. At least
one temporary decompression buffer is internal to the library and
never pinned.

Apiman is a flexible and open source API Management platform. Due to a
missing permissions check, an attacker with an authenticated Apiman
Manager account may be able to gain access to API keys they do not
have permission for if they correctly guess the URL, which includes
Organisation ID, Client ID, and Client Version of the targeted non-
permitted resource. While not trivial to exploit, it could be achieved
by brute-forcing or guessing common names. Access to the non-permitted
API Keys could allow use of other users' resources without their
permission (depending on the specifics of configuration, such as
whether an API key is the only form of security). Apiman 3.1.0.Final
resolved this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known

A remote command injection vulnerability exists in the Barracuda Email
Security Gateway (appliance form factor only) product effecting
versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006. The vulnerability arises out of a
failure to comprehensively sanitize the processing of .tar file (tape
archives). The vulnerability stems from incomplete input validation of
a user-supplied .tar file as it pertains to the names of the files
contained within the archive. As a consequence, a remote attacker can
specifically format these file names in a particular manner that will
result in remotely executing a system command through Perl's qx
operator with the privileges of the Email Security Gateway product.
This issue was fixed as part of BNSF-36456 patch. This patch was
automatically applied to all customer appliances.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20230719 CVE-2023-28754: ShardingSphere-Agent: Deserialization vulnerability in ShardingSphere Agent
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/19/3

Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability in Apache
ShardingSphere-Agent, which allows attackers to execute arbitrary code
by constructing a special YAML configuration file. The attacker needs
to have permission to modify the ShardingSphere Agent YAML
configuration file on the target machine, and the target machine can
access the URL with the arbitrary code JAR. An attacker can use
SnakeYAML to deserialize java.net.URLClassLoader and make it load a
JAR from a specified URL, and then deserialize
javax.script.ScriptEngineManager to load code using that ClassLoader.
When the ShardingSphere JVM process starts and uses the
ShardingSphere-Agent, the arbitrary code specified by the attacker
will be executed during the deserialization of the YAML configuration
file by the Agent. This issue affects ShardingSphere-Agent: through
5.3.2. This vulnerability is fixed in Apache ShardingSphere 5.4.0.

Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In
affected versions admins of a server were able to upload a logo or a
favicon and to provided a file name which was not restricted and could
overwrite files in the appdata directory. Administrators may have
access to overwrite these files by other means but this method could
be exploited by tricking an admin into uploading a maliciously named
file. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to
24.0.10 or 25.0.4. Users unable to upgrade should avoid ingesting logo
files from untrusted sources.

Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django.
Starting in version 1.5 and prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a
stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists on ModelAdmin
views within the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-
permission editor account for the Wagtail admin could potentially
craft pages and documents that, when viewed by a user with higher
privileges, could perform actions with that user's credentials. The
vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without
access to the Wagtail admin, and only affects sites with ModelAdmin
enabled. For page, the vulnerability is in the "Choose a parent page"
ModelAdmin view (`ChooseParentView`), available when managing pages
via ModelAdmin. For documents, the vulnerability is in the ModelAdmin
Inspect view (`InspectView`) when displaying document fields. Patched
versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2. Site
owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions can disable or
override the corresponding functionality.

Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django.
Prior to versions 4.1.4 and 4.2.2, a memory exhaustion bug exists in
Wagtail's handling of uploaded images and documents. For both images
and documents, files are loaded into memory during upload for
additional processing. A user with access to upload images or
documents through the Wagtail admin interface could upload a file so
large that it results in a crash of denial of service. The
vulnerability is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without
access to the Wagtail admin. It can only be exploited by admin users
with permission to upload images or documents. Image uploads are
restricted to 10MB by default, however this validation only happens on
the frontend and on the backend after the vulnerable code. Patched
versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.4 and Wagtail 4.2.2). Site
owners who are unable to upgrade to the new versions are encouraged to
add extra protections outside of Wagtail to limit the size of uploaded
files.

Moby is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc.
that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various
other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component
(`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby, is commonly referred to
as *Docker*. Swarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default
in dockerd and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a
simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a
combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code. The overlay
network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated
virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services
across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN,
which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that
tag the frame with a VXLAN Network ID (VNI) that identifies the
originating overlay network. In addition, the overlay network driver
supports an optional, off-by-default encrypted mode, which is
especially useful when VXLAN packets traverses an untrusted network
between nodes. Encrypted overlay networks function by encapsulating
the VXLAN datagrams through the use of the IPsec Encapsulating
Security Payload protocol in Transport mode. By deploying IPSec
encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks gain the additional
properties of source authentication through cryptographic proof, data
integrity through check-summing, and confidentiality through
encryption. When setting an endpoint up on an encrypted overlay
network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel firewall) rules
that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These rules rely on the
u32 iptables extension provided by the xt_u32 kernel module to
directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so that IPSec
guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks without
interfering with other overlay networks or other users of VXLAN. Two
iptables rules serve to filter incoming VXLAN datagrams with a VNI
that corresponds to an encrypted network and discards unencrypted
datagrams. The rules are appended to the end of the INPUT filter
chain, following any rules that have been previously set by the system
administrator. Administrator-set rules take precedence over the rules
Moby sets to discard unencrypted VXLAN datagrams, which can
potentially admit unencrypted datagrams that should have been
discarded. The injection of arbitrary Ethernet frames can enable a
Denial of Service attack. A sophisticated attacker may be able to
establish a UDP or TCP connection by way of the container&#8217;s outbound
gateway that would otherwise be blocked by a stateful firewall, or
carry out other escalations beyond simple injection by smuggling
packets into the overlay network. Patches are available in Moby
releases 23.0.3 and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10
releases are numbered differently, users of that platform should
update to 20.10.16. Some workarounds are available. Close the VXLAN
port (by default, UDP port 4789) to incoming traffic at the Internet
boundary to prevent all VXLAN packet injection, and/or ensure that the
`xt_u32` kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.

that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks
without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of
VXLAN. An iptables rule designates outgoing VXLAN datagrams with a VNI
that corresponds to an encrypted overlay network for IPsec
encapsulation. Encrypted overlay networks on affected platforms
silently transmit unencrypted data. As a result, `overlay` networks
may appear to be functional, passing traffic as expected, but without
any of the expected confidentiality or data integrity guarantees. It
is possible for an attacker sitting in a trusted position on the
network to read all of the application traffic that is moving across
the overlay network, resulting in unexpected secrets or user data
disclosure. Thus, because many database protocols, internal APIs, etc.
are not protected by a second layer of encryption, a user may use
Swarm encrypted overlay networks to provide confidentiality, which due
to this vulnerability this is no longer guaranteed. Patches are
available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As Mirantis Container
Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently, users of that
platform should update to 20.10.16. Some workarounds are available.
Close the VXLAN port (by default, UDP port 4789) to outgoing traffic
at the Internet boundary in order to prevent unintentionally leaking
unencrypted traffic over the Internet, and/or ensure that the `xt_u32`
kernel module is available on all nodes of the Swarm cluster.

Moby) is an open source container framework developed by Docker Inc.
that is distributed as Docker, Mirantis Container Runtime, and various
other downstream projects/products. The Moby daemon component
(`dockerd`), which is developed as moby/moby is commonly referred to
as *Docker*. Swarm Mode, which is compiled in and delivered by default
in `dockerd` and is thus present in most major Moby downstreams, is a
simple, built-in container orchestrator that is implemented through a
combination of SwarmKit and supporting network code. The `overlay`
network driver is a core feature of Swarm Mode, providing isolated
virtual LANs that allow communication between containers and services
across the cluster. This driver is an implementation/user of VXLAN,
which encapsulates link-layer (Ethernet) frames in UDP datagrams that
tag the frame with the VXLAN metadata, including a VXLAN Network ID
(VNI) that identifies the originating overlay network. In addition,
the overlay network driver supports an optional, off-by-default
encrypted mode, which is especially useful when VXLAN packets
traverses an untrusted network between nodes. Encrypted overlay
networks function by encapsulating the VXLAN datagrams through the use
of the IPsec Encapsulating Security Payload protocol in Transport
mode. By deploying IPSec encapsulation, encrypted overlay networks
gain the additional properties of source authentication through
cryptographic proof, data integrity through check-summing, and
confidentiality through encryption. When setting an endpoint up on an
encrypted overlay network, Moby installs three iptables (Linux kernel
firewall) rules that enforce both incoming and outgoing IPSec. These
rules rely on the `u32` iptables extension provided by the `xt_u32`
kernel module to directly filter on a VXLAN packet's VNI field, so
that IPSec guarantees can be enforced on encrypted overlay networks
without interfering with other overlay networks or other users of
VXLAN. The `overlay` driver dynamically and lazily defines the kernel
configuration for the VXLAN network on each node as containers are
attached and detached. Routes and encryption parameters are only
defined for destination nodes that participate in the network. The
iptables rules that prevent encrypted overlay networks from accepting
unencrypted packets are not created until a peer is available with
which to communicate. Encrypted overlay networks silently accept
cleartext VXLAN datagrams that are tagged with the VNI of an encrypted
overlay network. As a result, it is possible to inject arbitrary
Ethernet frames into the encrypted overlay network by encapsulating
them in VXLAN datagrams. The implications of this can be quite dire,
and GHSA-vwm3-crmr-xfxw should be referenced for a deeper exploration.
Patches are available in Moby releases 23.0.3, and 20.10.24. As
Mirantis Container Runtime's 20.10 releases are numbered differently,
users of that platform should update to 20.10.16. Some workarounds are
available. In multi-node clusters, deploy a global &#8216;pause&#8217; container
for each encrypted overlay network, on every node. For a single-node
cluster, do not use overlay networks of any sort. Bridge networks
provide the same connectivity on a single node and have no multi-node
features. The Swarm ingress feature is implemented using an overlay
network, but can be disabled by publishing ports in `host` mode
instead of `ingress` mode (allowing the use of an external load
balancer), and removing the `ingress` network. If encrypted overlay
networks are in exclusive use, block UDP port 4789 from traffic that
has not been validated by IPSec.

Unpoly is a JavaScript framework for server-side web applications.
There is a possible Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability in the
`unpoly-rails` gem that implements the Unpoly server protocol for
Rails applications. This issues affects Rails applications that
operate as an upstream of a load balancer's that uses passive health
checks. The `unpoly-rails` gem echoes the request URL as an `X-Up-
Location` response header. By making a request with exceedingly long
URLs (paths or query string), an attacker can cause unpoly-rails to
write a exceedingly large response header. If the response header is
too large to be parsed by a load balancer downstream of the Rails
application, it may cause the load balancer to remove the upstream
from a load balancing group. This causes that application instance to
become unavailable until a configured timeout is reached or until an
active healthcheck succeeds. This issue has been fixed and released as
version 2.7.2.2 which is available via RubyGems and GitHub. Users
unable to upgrade may: Configure your load balancer to use active
health checks, e.g. by periodically requesting a route with a known
response that indicates healthiness; Configure your load balancer so
the maximum size of response headers is at least twice the maximum
size of a URL; or instead of changing your server configuration you
may also configure your Rails application to delete redundant `X-Up-
Location` headers set by unpoly-rails.

Apereo CAS is an open source multilingual single sign-on solution for
the web. Apereo CAS can be configured to use authentication based on
client X509 certificates. These certificates can be provided via TLS
handshake or a special HTTP header, such as &#8220;ssl_client_cert&#8221;. When
checking the validity of the provided client certificate,
X509CredentialsAuthenticationHandler performs check that this
certificate is not revoked. To do so, it fetches URLs provided in the
&#8220;CRL Distribution Points&#8221; extension of the certificate, which are
taken from the certificate itself and therefore can be controlled by a
malicious user. If the CAS server is configured to use an LDAP server
for x509 authentication with a password, for example by setting a
&#8220;cas.authn.x509.ldap.ldap-url&#8221; and &#8220;cas.authn.x509.ldap.bind-
credential&#8221; properties, X509CredentialsAuthenticationHandler fetches
revocation URLs from the certificate, which can be LDAP urls. When
making requests to this LDAP urls, Apereo CAS uses the same password
as for initially configured LDAP server, which can lead to a password
leak. An unauthenticated user can leak the password used to LDAP
connection configured on server. This issue has been addressed in
version 6.6.6. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

DataSpider Servista version 4.4 and earlier uses a hard-coded
cryptographic key. DataSpider Servista is data integration software.
ScriptRunner and ScriptRunner for Amazon SQS are used to start the
configured processes on DataSpider Servista. The cryptographic key is
embedded in ScriptRunner and ScriptRunner for Amazon SQS, which is
common to all users. If an attacker who can gain access to a target
DataSpider Servista instance and obtain a Launch Settings file of
ScriptRunner and/or ScriptRunner for Amazon SQS, the attacker may
perform operations with the user privilege encrypted in the file. Note
that DataSpider Servista and some of the OEM products are affected by
this vulnerability. For the details of affected products and versions,

in packet processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX10002 allows
an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker on the local broadcast domain
sending a malformed packet to the device, causing all PFEs other than
the inbound PFE to wedge and to eventually restart, resulting in a
Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued receipt and processing of
this packet will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
This issue can only be triggered by sending a specific malformed

The Brizy Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to IP
Address Spoofing in versions up to, and including, 2.4.18. This is due
to an implicit trust of user-supplied IP addresses in an 'X-Forwarded-

against a Maintenance Mode whitelist. Supplying a whitelisted IP
address within the 'X-Forwarded-For' header allows maintenance mode to
be bypassed and may result in the disclosure of potentially sensitive

An Improper Restriction of Communication Channel to Intended Endpoints
vulnerability in the timescaledb feature of Juniper Networks Paragon
Active Assurance (PAA) (Formerly Netrounds) allows an attacker to
bypass existing firewall rules and limitations used to restrict
internal communcations. The Test Agents (TA) Appliance connects to the
Control Center (CC) using OpenVPN. TA's are assigned an internal IP
address in the 100.70.0.0/16 range. Firewall rules exists to limit
communication from TA's to the CC to specific services only. OpenVPN
is configured to not allow direct communication between Test Agents in
the OpenVPN application itself, and routing is normally not enabled on
the server running the CC application. The timescaledb feature is
installed as an optional package on the Control Center. When the
timescaledb container is started, this causes side-effects by
bypassing the existing firewall rules and limitations for Test Agent
communications. Note: This issue only affects customers hosting their
own on-prem Control Center. The Paragon Active Assurance Software as a
Service (SaaS) is not affected by this vulnerability since the
timescaledb service is not enabled. This issue affects all on-prem
versions of Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance prior to 4.1.2.

such as TLS private keys for Ingress and GatewayAPI resources. An
attacker with access to debug output from the Cilium containers could
use the resulting output to intercept and modify traffic to and from
the affected cluster. Output of the sensitive information would occur
at Cilium agent restart, when secrets in the namespace are modified,
and on creation of Ingress or GatewayAPI resources. This vulnerability
is fixed in Cilium releases 1.11.16, 1.12.9, and 1.13.2. Users unable
to upgrade should disable debug mode.

SvelteKit is a web development framework. The SvelteKit framework
offers developers an option to create simple REST APIs. This is done
by defining a `+server.js` file, containing endpoint handlers for
different HTTP methods. SvelteKit provides out-of-the-box cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) protection to its users. While the
implementation does a sufficient job in mitigating common CSRF
attacks, prior to version 1.15.1, the protection can be bypassed by
simply specifying a different `Content-Type` header value. If abused,
this issue will allow malicious requests to be submitted from third-
party domains, which can allow execution of operations within the
context of the victim's session, and in extreme scenarios can lead to
unauthorized access to users&#8217; accounts. SvelteKit 1.15.1 updates the
`is_form_content_type` function call in the CSRF protection logic to
include `text/plain`. As additional hardening of the CSRF protection
mechanism against potential method overrides, SvelteKit 1.15.1 is now
performing validation on `PUT`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` methods as well.
This latter hardening is only needed to protect users who have put in
some sort of `?_method= override` feature themselves in their `handle`
hook, so that the request that resolve sees could be
`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` when the browser issues a `POST` request.

hap-wi/roxy-wi is a web interface for managing Haproxy, Nginx, Apache
and Keepalived servers. A Path Traversal vulnerability was found in
the current version of Roxy-WI (6.3.9.0 at the moment of writing this
report). The vulnerability can be exploited via an HTTP request to
/app/options.py and the config_file_name parameter. Successful
exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker with user
level privileges to obtain the content of arbitrary files on the file
server within the scope of what the server process has access to. The
root-cause of the vulnerability lies in the get_config function of the
/app/modules/config/config.py file, which only checks for relative
path traversal, but still allows to read files from absolute locations
passed via the config_file_name parameter.

endpoint handlers for different HTTP methods. SvelteKit provides out-
of-the-box cross-site request forgery (CSRF) protection to its users.
The protection is implemented at `kit/src/runtime/server/respond.js`.
While the implementation does a sufficient job of mitigating common
CSRF attacks, the protection can be bypassed in versions prior to
1.15.2 by simply specifying an upper-cased `Content-Type` header
value. The browser will not send uppercase characters, but this check
does not block all expected CORS requests. If abused, this issue will
allow malicious requests to be submitted from third-party domains,
which can allow execution of operations within the context of the
victim's session, and in extreme scenarios can lead to unauthorized
access to users&#8217; accounts. This may lead to all POST operations
requiring authentication being allowed in the following cases: If the
target site sets `SameSite=None` on its auth cookie and the user
visits a malicious site in a Chromium-based browser; if the target
site doesn't set the `SameSite` attribute explicitly and the user
visits a malicious site with Firefox/Safari with tracking protections
turned off; and/or if the user is visiting a malicious site with a
very outdated browser. SvelteKit 1.15.2 contains a patch for this
issue. It is also recommended to explicitly set `SameSite` to a value
other than `None` on authentication cookies especially if the upgrade
cannot be done in a timely manner.

Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, ships with an executable
called `connect.exe`, which implements a SOCKS5 proxy that can be used
to connect e.g. to SSH servers via proxies when certain ports are
blocked for outgoing connections. The location of `connect.exe`'s
config file is hard-coded as `/etc/connectrc` which will typically be
interpreted as `C:\etc\connectrc`. Since `C:\etc` can be created by
any authenticated user, this makes `connect.exe` susceptible to
malicious files being placed there by other users on the same multi-
user machine. The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.40.1.
As a workaround, create the folder `etc` on all drives where Git
commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders.
Alternatively, watch out for malicious `<drive>:\etc\connectrc` files
on multi-user machines.

@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the
Fastify ecosystem. Applications using `@fastify/passport` in affected
versions for user authentication, in combination with
`@fastify/session` as the underlying session management mechanism, are
vulnerable to session fixation attacks from network and same-site
attackers. fastify applications rely on the `@fastify/passport`
library for user authentication. The login and user validation are
performed by the `authenticate` function. When executing this
function, the `sessionId` is preserved between the pre-login and the
authenticated session. Network and same-site attackers can hijack the
victim's session by tossing a valid `sessionId` cookie in the victim's
browser and waiting for the victim to log in on the website. As a
solution, newer versions of `@fastify/passport` regenerate `sessionId`
upon login, preventing the attacker-controlled pre-session cookie from
being upgraded to an authenticated session. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

@fastify/passport is a port of passport authentication library for the
Fastify ecosystem. The CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forger) protection
enforced by the `@fastify/csrf-protection` library, when combined with
`@fastify/passport` in affected versions, can be bypassed by network
and same-site attackers. `fastify/csrf-protection` implements the
synchronizer token pattern (using plugins `@fastify/session` and
`@fastify/secure-session`) by storing a random value used for CSRF
token generation in the `_csrf` attribute of a user's session. The
`@fastify/passport` library does not clear the session object upon
authentication, preserving the `_csrf` attribute between pre-login and
authenticated sessions. Consequently, CSRF tokens generated before
authentication are still valid. Network and same-site attackers can
thus obtain a CSRF token for their pre-session, fixate that pre-
session in the victim's browser via cookie tossing, and then perform a
CSRF attack after the victim authenticates. As a solution, newer
versions of `@fastify/passport` include the configuration options:
`clearSessionOnLogin (default: true)` and `clearSessionIgnoreFields
(default: ['passport', 'session'])` to clear all the session
attributes by default, preserving those explicitly defined in
`clearSessionIgnoreFields`.

application programmable interface (API). An attacker could log in
using account credentials available through a request generated by an
internal user and then manipulate the visitor-id within the web API to
access the personal data of other users. There is no limit on the
number of requests that can be made to the HID SAFE Web Server, so an

connections were logged. Some connections use user-controlled
endpoints, which could be malicious and attempt to keep the connection

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20240129 CVE-2023-29055: Apache Kylin: Insufficiently protected credentials in config file
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/29/1

In Apache Kylin version 2.0.0 to 4.0.3, there is a Server Config web
interface that displays the content of file 'kylin.properties', that
may contain serverside credentials. When the kylin service runs over
HTTP (or other plain text protocol), it is possible for network
sniffers to hijack the HTTP payload and get access to the content of
kylin.properties and potentially the containing credentials. To avoid
this threat, users are recommended to * Always turn on HTTPS so that
network payload is encrypted. * Avoid putting credentials in
kylin.properties, or at least not in plain text. * Use network
firewalls to protect the serverside such that it is not accessible to
external attackers. * Upgrade to version Apache Kylin 4.0.4, which
filters out the sensitive content that goes to the Server Config web
interface.

SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired, database system
for creating and managing security-critical application permissions.
The `spicedb serve` command contains a flag named `--grpc-preshared-
key` which is used to protect the gRPC API from being accessed by
unauthorized requests. The values of this flag are to be considered
sensitive, secret data. The `/debug/pprof/cmdline` endpoint served by
the metrics service (defaulting running on port `9090`) reveals the
command-line flags provided for debugging purposes. If a password is
set via the `--grpc-preshared-key` then the key is revealed by this
endpoint along with any other flags provided to the SpiceDB binary.
This issue has been fixed in version 1.19.1. ### Impact All
deployments abiding by the recommended best practices for production
usage are **NOT affected**: - Authzed's SpiceDB Serverless - Authzed's
SpiceDB Dedicated - SpiceDB Operator Users configuring SpiceDB via
environment variables are **NOT affected**. Users **MAY be affected**
if they expose their metrics port to an untrusted network and are
configuring `--grpc-preshared-key` via command-line flag. ### Patches
TODO ### Workarounds To workaround this issue you can do one of the
following: - Configure the preshared key via an environment variable
(e.g. `SPICEDB_GRPC_PRESHARED_KEY=yoursecret spicedb serve`) -
Reconfigure the `--metrics-addr` flag to bind to a trusted network
(e.g. `--metrics-addr=localhost:9090`) - Disable the metrics service
via the flag (e.g. `--metrics-enabled=false`) - Adopt one of the
recommended deployment models: [Authzed's managed
services](https://authzed.com/pricing) or the [SpiceDB
Operator](https://github.com/authzed/spicedb-operator) ### References

Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of
MySQL. Users can either intentionally or inadvertently create a
keyspace containing `/` characters such that from that point on,
anyone who tries to view keyspaces from VTAdmin will receive an error.
Trying to list all the keyspaces using `vtctldclient GetKeyspaces`
will also return an error. Note that all other keyspaces can still be
administered using the CLI (vtctldclient). This issue is fixed in
version 16.0.1. As a workaround, delete the offending keyspace using a
CLI client (vtctldclient).

Vitess is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL
through generalized sharding. Prior to version 16.0.2, users can
either intentionally or inadvertently create a shard containing `/`
characters from VTAdmin such that from that point on, anyone who tries
to create a new shard from VTAdmin will receive an error. Attempting
to view the keyspace(s) will also no longer work. Creating a shard
using `vtctldclient` does not have the same problem because the CLI
validates the input correctly. Version 16.0.2, corresponding to
version 0.16.2 of the `go` module, contains a patch for this issue.
Some workarounds are available. Always use `vtctldclient` to create
shards, instead of using VTAdmin; disable creating shards from VTAdmin
using RBAC; and/or delete the topology record for the offending shard
using the client for your topology server.

Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. This
vulnerability is not exploitable on the default install of Discourse.
A custom feature must be enabled for it to work at all, and the
attacker&#8217;s payload must pass the CSP to be executed. However, if an
attacker succeeds in embedding Javascript that does pass the CSP, it
could result in session hijacking for any users that view the
attacker&#8217;s post. The vulnerability is patched in the latest tests-
passed, beta and stable branches. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
unable to upgrade should enable and/or restore your site's CSP to the
default one provided with Discourse. Remove any embed-able hosts
configured.

guzzlehttp/psr7 is a PSR-7 HTTP message library implementation in PHP.
Affected versions are subject to improper header parsing. An attacker
could sneak in a newline (\n) into both the header names and values.
While the specification states that \r\n\r\n is used to terminate the
header list, many servers in the wild will also accept \n\n. This is a
follow-up to CVE-2022-24775 where the fix was incomplete. The issue

Reference: URL:https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/context-bridge#parameter--error--return-type-support

Electron is a framework which lets you write cross-platform desktop
applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Electron apps using
`contextIsolation` and `contextBridge` are affected. This is a context
isolation bypass, meaning that code running in the main world context
in the renderer can reach into the isolated Electron context and
perform privileged actions. This issue is only exploitable if an API
exposed to the main world via `contextBridge` can return an object or
array that contains a javascript object which cannot be serialized,
for instance, a canvas rendering context. This would normally result
in an exception being thrown `Error: object could not be cloned`. The
app side workaround is to ensure that such a case is not possible.
Ensure all values returned from a function exposed over the context
bridge are supported. This issue has been fixed in versions
`25.0.0-alpha.2`, `24.0.1`, `23.2.3`, and `22.3.6`.

There exists a vulnerability in source code transformer (exception
sanitization logic) of vm2 for versions up to 3.9.15, allowing
attackers to bypass `handleException()` and leak unsanitized host
exceptions which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary
code in host context. A threat actor can bypass the sandbox
protections to gain remote code execution rights on the host running
the sandbox. This vulnerability was patched in the release of version
`3.9.16` of `vm2`.

XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top
level XWiki projects. The "restricted" mode of the HTML cleaner in
XWiki, introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1, only escaped `<script>`
and `<style>`-tags but neither attributes that can be used to inject
scripts nor other dangerous HTML tags like `<iframe>`. As a
consequence, any code relying on this "restricted" mode for security
is vulnerable to JavaScript injection ("cross-site scripting"/XSS).
When a privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment
in XWiki, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of
the user session. This allows server-side code execution with
programming rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of the XWiki instance. This problem has been patched in
XWiki 14.6 RC1 with the introduction of a filter with allowed HTML
elements and attributes that is enabled in restricted mode. There are
no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the
fix.

XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top
level XWiki projects. The RSS macro that is bundled in XWiki included
the content of the feed items without any cleaning in the HTML output
when the parameter `content` was set to `true`. This allowed arbitrary
HTML and in particular also JavaScript injection and thus cross-site
scripting (XSS) by specifying an RSS feed with malicious content. With
the interaction of a user with programming rights, this could be used
to execute arbitrary actions in the wiki, including privilege
escalation, remote code execution, information disclosure, modifying
or deleting content and sabotaging the wiki. The issue has been
patched in XWiki 14.6 RC1, the content of the feed is now properly
cleaned before being displayed. As a workaround, if the RSS macro
isn't used in the wiki, the macro can be uninstalled by deleting `WEB-
INF/lib/xwiki-platform-rendering-macro-rss-XX.jar`, where `XX` is
XWiki's version, in the web application's directory.

measures put in place to avoid open redirect by using a redirect such
as `//mydomain.com` (i.e. omitting the `http:`). It was also possible

XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top
level XWiki projects. The HTML macro does not systematically perform a
proper neutralization of script-related html tags. As a result, any
user able to use the html macro in XWiki, is able to introduce an XSS
attack. This can be particularly dangerous since in a standard wiki,
any user is able to use the html macro directly in their own user
profile page. The problem has been patched in XWiki 14.8RC1. The patch
involves the HTML macros and are systematically cleaned up whenever
the user does not have the script correct.

XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top
level XWiki projects. There was no check in the author of a JavaScript
xobject or StyleSheet xobject added in a XWiki document, so until now
it was possible for a user having only Edit Right to create such
object and to craft a script allowing to perform some operations when
executing by a user with appropriate rights. This has been patched in
XWiki 14.9-rc-1 by only executing the script if the author of it has
Script rights.

XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top
level XWiki projects. The Livetable Macro wasn't properly sanitizing
column names, thus allowing the insertion of raw HTML code including
JavaScript. This vulnerability was also exploitable via the Documents
Macro that is included since XWiki 3.5M1 and doesn't require script
rights, this can be demonstrated with the syntax `{{documents
id="example" count="5" actions="false" columns="doc.title,
before<script>alert(1)</script>after"/}}`. Therefore, this can also be
exploited by users without script right and in comments. With the
interaction of a user with more rights, this could be used to execute
arbitrary actions in the wiki, including privilege escalation, remote
code execution, information disclosure, modifying or deleting content.
This has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10.

Reference: MISC:https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/security-resources/security-advisories/?fid=31797

In Shadow 4.13, it is possible to inject control characters into
fields provided to the SUID program chfn (change finger). Although it
is not possible to exploit this directly (e.g., adding a new user
fails because \n is in the block list), it is possible to misrepresent
the /etc/passwd file when viewed. Use of \r manipulations and Unicode
characters to work around blocking of the : character make it possible
to give the impression that a new user has been added. In other words,
an adversary may be able to convince a system administrator to take
the system offline (an indirect, social-engineered denial of service)
by demonstrating that "cat /etc/passwd" shows a rogue user account.

a filename of "setup.bat&quot;;x=.txt" will be sent as a file named
"setup.bat". If the FileAttachment function is called with names
provided by an untrusted source, this may permit an attacker to cause
a file to be served with a name different than provided. Maliciously
crafted attachment file name can modify the Content-Disposition
header.

On Unix platforms, the Go runtime does not behave differently when a
binary is run with the setuid/setgid bits. This can be dangerous in
certain cases, such as when dumping memory state, or assuming the
status of standard i/o file descriptors. If a setuid/setgid binary is
executed with standard I/O file descriptors closed, opening any files
can result in unexpected content being read or written with elevated
privileges. Similarly, if a setuid/setgid program is terminated,
either via panic or signal, it may leak the contents of its registers.

A maliciously-crafted image can cause excessive CPU consumption in
decoding. A tiled image with a height of 0 and a very large width can
cause excessive CPU consumption, despite the image size (width *
height) appearing to be zero.

The TIFF decoder does not place a limit on the size of compressed tile
data. A maliciously-crafted image can exploit this to cause a small
image (both in terms of pixel width/height, and encoded size) to make
the decoder decode large amounts of compressed data, consuming
excessive memory and CPU.

Extremely large RSA keys in certificate chains can cause a
client/server to expend significant CPU time verifying signatures.
With fix, the size of RSA keys transmitted during handshakes is
restricted to <= 8192 bits. Based on a survey of publicly trusted RSA
keys, there are currently only three certificates in circulation with
keys larger than this, and all three appear to be test certificates
that are not actively deployed. It is possible there are larger keys
in use in private PKIs, but we target the web PKI, so causing breakage
here in the interests of increasing the default safety of users of
crypto/tls seems reasonable.

Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string
delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used,
since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go
template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of
the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary
Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are
rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the
decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being
used inside of them (e.g., "var a = {{.}}"), since there is no
obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same
approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template. Parse
returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an
ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported but will
be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the previous
behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag jstmpllitinterp=1,
with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped. This should be
used with caution.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. In XWiki, every user can add
translations that are only applied to the current user. This also
allows overriding existing translations. Such translations are often
included in privileged contexts without any escaping which allows
remote code execution for any user who has edit access on at least one
document which could be the user's own profile where edit access is
enabled by default. A mitigation for this vulnerability is part of
XWiki 14.10.2 and XWiki 15.0 RC1: translations with user scope now
require script right. This means that regular users cannot exploit
this anymore as users don't have script right by default anymore
starting with XWiki 14.10. There are no known workarounds apart from
upgrading to a patched versions.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. Any user who can create a space
can become admin of that space through App Within Minutes. The admin
right implies the script right and thus allows JavaScript injection.
The vulnerability can be exploited by creating an app in App Within
Minutes. If the button should be disabled because the user doesn't
have global edit right, the app can also be created by directly
opening
`/xwiki/bin/view/AppWithinMinutes/CreateApplication?wizard=true` on
the XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 13.10.11,
14.4.8, 14.10.1 and 15.0 RC1 by not granting the space admin right if
the user doesn't have script right on the space where the app is
created. Error message are displayed to warn the user that the app
will be broken in this case. Users who became space admin through this
vulnerability won't loose the space admin right due to the fix, so it
is advised to check if all users who created AWM apps should keep
their space admin rights. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this vulnerability.

modify the page
`XWiki.Notifications.Code.LegacyNotificationAdministration` to add the
missing escaping. For versions < 14.6-rc-1 a workaround is to modify
the file `<xwikiwebapp>/templates/distribution/eventmigration.wiki` to
add the missing escaping.

XWiki Commons are technical libraries common to several other top
level XWiki projects. The "restricted" mode of the HTML cleaner in
XWiki, introduced in version 4.2-milestone-1 and massively improved in
version 14.6-rc-1, allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code and
thus cross-site scripting via invalid HTML comments. As a consequence,
any code relying on this "restricted" mode for security is vulnerable
to JavaScript injection ("cross-site scripting"/XSS). When a
privileged user with programming rights visits such a comment in
XWiki, the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the
user session. This allows server-side code execution with programming
rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
the XWiki instance. This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10, HTML
comments are now removed in restricted mode and a check has been
introduced that ensures that comments don't start with `>`. There are
no known workarounds apart from upgrading to a version including the
fix.

matrix-js-sdk is the Matrix Client-Server SDK for JavaScript and
TypeScript. An attacker present in a room where an MSC3401 group call
is taking place can eavesdrop on the video and audio of participants
using matrix-js-sdk, without their knowledge. To affected matrix-js-
sdk users, the attacker will not appear to be participating in the
call. This attack is possible because matrix-js-sdk's group call
implementation accepts incoming direct calls from other users, even if
they have not yet declared intent to participate in the group call, as
a means of resolving a race condition in call setup. Affected versions
do not restrict access to the user's outbound media in this case.
Legacy 1:1 calls are unaffected. This is fixed in matrix-js-sdk
24.1.0. As a workaround, users may hold group calls in private rooms
where only the exact users who are expected to participate in the call
are present.

Laminas Diactoros provides PSR HTTP Message implementations. In
versions 2.18.0 and prior, 2.19.0, 2.20.0, 2.21.0, 2.22.0, 2.23.0,
2.24.0, and 2.25.0, users who create HTTP requests or responses using
laminas/laminas-diactoros, when providing a newline at the start or
end of a header key or value, can cause an invalid message. This can
lead to denial of service vectors or application errors. The problem
has been patched in following versions 2.18.1, 2.19.1, 2.20.1, 2.21.1,
2.22.1, 2.23.1, 2.24.1, and 2.25.1. As a workaround, validate HTTP
header keys and/or values, and if using user-supplied values, filter
them to strip off leading or trailing newline characters before
calling `withHeader()`.

Issue summary: The AES-SIV cipher implementation contains a bug that
causes it to ignore empty associated data entries which are
unauthenticated as a consequence. Impact summary: Applications that
use the AES-SIV algorithm and want to authenticate empty data entries
as associated data can be mislead by removing adding or reordering
such empty entries as these are ignored by the OpenSSL implementation.
We are currently unaware of any such applications. The AES-SIV
algorithm allows for authentication of multiple associated data
entries along with the encryption. To authenticate empty data the
application has to call EVP_EncryptUpdate() (or EVP_CipherUpdate())
with NULL pointer as the output buffer and 0 as the input buffer
length. The AES-SIV implementation in OpenSSL just returns success for
such a call instead of performing the associated data authentication
operation. The empty data thus will not be authenticated. As this
issue does not affect non-empty associated data authentication and we
expect it to be rare for an application to use empty associated data
entries this is qualified as Low severity issue.

The WordPress Social Login and Register (Discord, Google, Twitter,
LinkedIn) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass
in versions up to, and including, 7.6.4. This is due to insufficient
encryption on the user being supplied during a login validated through
the plugin. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
log in as any existing user on the site, such as an administrator, if
they know the email address associated with that user. This was
partially patched in version 7.6.4 and fully patched in version 7.6.5.

The Abandoned Cart Lite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
vulnerable to authentication bypass in versions up to, and including,
5.14.2. This is due to insufficient encryption on the user being
supplied during the abandoned cart link decode through the plugin.
This allows unauthenticated attackers to log in as users who have
abandoned the cart, who are typically customers. Further security
hardening was introduced in version 5.15.1 that ensures sites are no
longer vulnerable through historical check-out links, and additional
hardening was introduced in version 5.15.2 that ensured null key
values wouldn't permit the authentication bypass.

The Wordapp plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization bypass
due to an use of insufficiently unique cryptographic signature on the
'wa_pdx_op_config_set' function in versions up to, and including,
1.5.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to the
plugin to change the 'validation_token' in the plugin config,
providing access to the plugin's remote control functionalities, such
as creating an admin access URL, which can be used for privilege
escalation.

A known cache speculation vulnerability, known as Branch History
Injection (BHI) or Spectre-BHB, becomes actual again for the new hw
AmpereOne. Spectre-BHB is similar to Spectre v2, except that malicious
code uses the shared branch history (stored in the CPU Branch History
Buffer, or BHB) to influence mispredicted branches within the victim's
hardware context. Once that occurs, speculation caused by the
mispredicted branches can cause cache allocation. This issue leads to
obtaining information that should not be accessible.

Insufficient authentication in the MQTT backend (broker) allows an
attacker to access and even manipulate the telemetry data of the
entire fleet of vehicles using the HopeChart HQT-401 telematics unit.
Other models are possibly affected too. Multiple vulnerabilities were
identified: - The MQTT backend does not require authentication,
allowing unauthorized connections from an attacker. - The vehicles
publish their telemetry data (e.g. GPS Location, speed, odometer,
fuel, etc) as messages in public topics. The backend also sends
commands to the vehicles as MQTT posts in public topics. As a result,
an attacker can access the confidential data of the entire fleet that
is managed by the backend. - The MQTT messages sent by the vehicles or
the backend are not encrypted or authenticated. An attacker can create
and post messages to impersonate a vehicle or the backend. The
attacker could then, for example, send incorrect information to the
backend about the vehicle's location. - The backend can inject data
into a vehicles CAN bus by sending a specific MQTT message on a
public topic. Because these messages are not authenticated or
encrypted, an attacker could impersonate the backend, create a fake
message and inject CAN data in any vehicle managed by the backend. The
confirmed version is 201808021036, however further versions have been
also identified as potentially impacted.

Multi-Remote Next Generation Connection Manager (mRemoteNG) is free

connection configurations to remotely connect to systems. mRemoteNG
configuration files can be stored in an encrypted state on disk.
mRemoteNG version <= v1.76.20 and <= 1.77.3-dev loads configuration
files in plain text into memory (after decrypting them if necessary)
at application start-up, even if no connection has been established
yet. This allows attackers to access contents of configuration files
in plain text through a memory dump and thus compromise user
credentials when no custom password encryption key has been set. This
also bypasses the connection configuration file encryption setting by
dumping already decrypted configurations from memory.

Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation
Apache Pulsar Broker's Rest Producer allows authenticated user with a
custom HTTP header to produce a message to any topic using the
broker's admin role. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Brokers: from
2.9.0 through 2.9.5, from 2.10.0 before 2.10.4, 2.11.0. The
vulnerability is exploitable when an attacker can connect directly to
the Pulsar Broker. If an attacker is connecting through the Pulsar
Proxy, there is no known way to exploit this authorization
vulnerability. There are two known risks for affected users. First, an
attacker could produce garbage messages to any topic in the cluster.
Second, an attacker could produce messages to the topic level policies
topic for other tenants and influence topic settings that could lead
to exfiltration and/or deletion of messages for other tenants. 2.8
Pulsar Broker users and earlier are unaffected. 2.9 Pulsar Broker
users should upgrade to one of the patched versions. 2.10 Pulsar
Broker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.4. 2.11 Pulsar Broker
users should upgrade to at least 2.11.1. 3.0 Pulsar Broker users are
unaffected.

Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation
Apache Pulsar. This issue affects Apache Pulsar: before 2.10.4, and
2.11.0. When a client connects to the Pulsar Function Worker via the
Pulsar Proxy where the Pulsar Proxy uses mTLS authentication to
authenticate with the Pulsar Function Worker, the Pulsar Function
Worker incorrectly performs authorization by using the Proxy's role
for authorization instead of the client's role, which can lead to
privilege escalation, especially if the proxy is configured with a
superuser role. The recommended mitigation for impacted users is to
upgrade the Pulsar Function Worker to a patched version. 2.10 Pulsar
Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.4. 2.11 Pulsar
Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.1. 3.0 Pulsar
Function Worker users are unaffected. Any users running the Pulsar
Function Worker for 2.9.* and earlier should upgrade to one of the
above patched versions.

including, 1.27.133 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
escaping. This makes it possible for contributor-level attackers to
inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a
user accesses an injected page.

The Page Builder by AZEXO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-
Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.27.133. This
is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'azh_add_post',
'azh_duplicate_post', 'azh_update_post' and 'azh_remove_post'
functions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
create, modify, and delete a post via a forged request granted they
can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
clicking on a link.

Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
framework. There are two instances of insecure deserialization in
Cacti version 1.2.24. While a viable gadget chain exists in Cacti&#8217;s
vendor directory (phpseclib), the necessary gadgets are not included,
making them inaccessible and the insecure deserializations not
exploitable. Each instance of insecure deserialization is due to using
the unserialize function without sanitizing the user input. Cacti has
a &#8220;safe&#8221; deserialization that attempts to sanitize the content and
check for specific values before calling unserialize, but it isn&#8217;t
used in these instances. The vulnerable code lies in graphs_new.php,
specifically within the host_new_graphs_save function. This issue has
been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There
are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Snowflake JDBC provides a JDBC type 4 driver that supports core
functionality, allowing Java program to connect to Snowflake. Users of
the Snowflake JDBC driver were vulnerable to a command injection
vulnerability. An attacker could set up a malicious, publicly
accessible server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack
payload. If the attacker then tricked a user into visiting the
maliciously crafted connection URL, the user&#8217;s local machine would
render the malicious payload, leading to a remote code execution. The
vulnerability was patched on March 17, 2023 as part of Snowflake JDBC
driver Version 3.13.29. All users should immediately upgrade the
Snowflake JDBC driver to the latest version: 3.13.29.

slim/psr7 is a PSR-7 implementation for use with Slim 4. In versions
prior to 1.6.1 an attacker could sneak in a newline (\n) into both the
header names and values. While the specification states that \r\n\r\n
is used to terminate the header list, many servers in the wild will
also accept \n\n. An attacker that is able to control the header names
that are passed to Slilm-Psr7 would be able to intentionally craft
invalid messages, possibly causing application errors or invalid HTTP
requests being sent out with an PSR-18 HTTP client. The latter might
present a denial of service vector if a remote service&#8217;s web
application firewall bans the application due to the receipt of
malformed requests. The issue has been patched in version 1.6.1. There
are no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract
development. A function in the implementation contract may be
inaccessible if its selector clashes with one of the proxy's own
selectors. Specifically, if the clashing function has a different
signature with incompatible ABI encoding, the proxy could revert while
attempting to decode the arguments from calldata. The probability of
an accidental clash is negligible, but one could be caused
deliberately and could cause a reduction in availability. The issue
has been fixed in version 4.8.3. As a workaround if a function appears
to be inaccessible for this reason, it may be possible to craft the
calldata such that ABI decoding does not fail at the proxy and the
function is properly proxied through.

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract
development. The proposal creation entrypoint (`propose`) in
`GovernorCompatibilityBravo` allows the creation of proposals with a
`signatures` array shorter than the `calldatas` array. This causes the
additional elements of the latter to be ignored, and if the proposal
succeeds the corresponding actions would eventually execute without
any calldata. The `ProposalCreated` event correctly represents what
will eventually execute, but the proposal parameters as queried
through `getActions` appear to respect the original intended calldata.
This issue has been patched in 4.8.3. As a workaround, ensure that all
proposals that pass through governance have equal length `signatures`
and `calldatas` parameters.

@web3-react is a framework for building Ethereum Apps . In affected
versions the `chainId` may be outdated if the user changes chains as
part of the connection flow. This means that the value of `chainId`
returned by `useWeb3React()` may be incorrect. In an application, this
means that any data derived from `chainId` could be incorrect. For
example, if a swapping application derives a wrapped token contract
address from the `chainId` *and* a user has changed chains as part of
their connection flow the application could cause the user to send
funds to the incorrect address when wrapping. This issue has been
addressed in PR #749 and is available in updated npm artifacts. There
are no known workarounds for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.

Contiki-NG is an operating system for Internet of Things devices. An
off-by-one error can be triggered in the Antelope database management
system in the Contiki-NG operating system in versions 4.8 and prior.
The problem exists in the Contiki File System (CFS) backend for the
storage of data (file os/storage/antelope/storage-cfs.c). In the
functions `storage_get_index` and `storage_put_index`, a buffer for
merging two strings is allocated with one byte less than the maximum
size of the merged strings, causing subsequent function calls to the
cfs_open function to read from memory beyond the buffer size. The
vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG,
and is expected to be included in the next release. As a workaround,
the problem can be fixed by applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull
request #2425.

gatsby-plugin-sharp is a plugin for the gatsby framework which exposes
functions built on the Sharp image processing library. The gatsby-
plugin-sharp plugin prior to versions 5.8.1 and 4.25.1 contains a path
traversal vulnerability exposed when running the Gatsby develop server
(`gatsby develop`). It should be noted that by default gatsby develop
is only accessible via the localhost 127.0.0.1, and one would need to
intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to exploit this
vulnerability by using server options such as --host 0.0.0.0, -H
0.0.0.0, or the GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0 environment variable. Attackers
exploiting this vulnerability will have read access to all files
within the scope of the server process. A patch has been introduced in
gatsby-plugin-sharp@5.8.1 and gatsby-plugin-sharp@4.25.1 which
mitigates the issue by ensuring that included paths remain within the
project directory. As stated above, by default gatsby develop is only
exposed to the localhost 127.0.0.1. For those using the develop server
in the default configuration no risk is posed. If other ranges are
required, preventing the develop server from being exposed to
untrusted interfaces or IP address ranges would mitigate the risk from
this vulnerability. Users are non the less encouraged to upgrade to a
safe version.

Apptainer is an open source container platform for Linux. There is an
ext4 use-after-free flaw that is exploitable through versions of
Apptainer < 1.1.0 and installations that include apptainer-suid <
1.1.8 on older operating systems where that CVE has not been patched.
That includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Debian 10 buster (unless the
linux-5.10 package is installed), Ubuntu 18.04 bionic and Ubuntu 20.04
focal. Use-after-free flaws in the kernel can be used to attack the
kernel for denial of service and potentially for privilege escalation.
Apptainer 1.1.8 includes a patch that by default disables mounting of
extfs filesystem types in setuid-root mode, while continuing to allow
mounting of extfs filesystems in non-setuid "rootless" mode using
fuse2fs. Some workarounds are possible. Either do not install
apptainer-suid (for versions 1.1.0 through 1.1.7) or set `allow setuid
= no` in apptainer.conf. This requires having unprivileged user
namespaces enabled and except for apptainer 1.1.x versions will
disallow mounting of sif files, extfs files, and squashfs files in
addition to other, less significant impacts. (Encrypted sif files are
also not supported unprivileged in apptainer 1.1.x.). Alternatively,
use the `limit containers` options in apptainer.conf/singularity.conf
to limit sif files to trusted users, groups, and/or paths, and set
`allow container extfs = no` to disallow mounting of extfs overlay
files. The latter option by itself does not disallow mounting of extfs
overlay partitions inside SIF files, so that's why the former options
are also needed.

Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project
contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an
attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are
subject to SQL injection in the `optimize_sqltuningadvisor` method of
`sql_optimize.py`. User input coming from the `db_name` parameter
value in `sql_optimize.py` is passed to the `sqltuningadvisor` method
in `oracle.py`for execution. To mitigate escape the variables accepted
via user input when used in `sql_optimize.py`. Users may also use
prepared statements when dealing with SQL as a mitigation for this
issue. This issue is also indexed as `GHSL-2022-107`.

Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project
contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an
attacker to query the connected databases. Affected versions are
subject to SQL injection in the `data_dictionary.py` `table_info`.
User input coming from the `db_name` in and the `tb_name` parameter
values in the `sql/data_dictionary.py` `table_info` endpoint is passed
to the following methods in the given SQL engine implementations,
which concatenate user input unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards
pass it to the `query` method of each database engine for
execution.The methods are `get_table_meta_data ` in
`sql/engines/mssql.py` which passes unsafe user input to the
`sql/engines/mssql.py` `query` method, `get_table_desc_data` in
`sql/engines/mssql.py`which passes unsafe user input to the

A vulnerability has been identified in the Node.js (.msi version)
installation process, specifically affecting Windows users who install
Node.js using the .msi installer. This vulnerability emerges during
the repair operation, where the "msiexec.exe" process, running under
the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM context, attempts to read the %USERPROFILE%
environment variable from the current user's registry. The issue
arises when the path referenced by the %USERPROFILE% environment
variable does not exist. In such cases, the "msiexec.exe" process
attempts to create the specified path in an unsafe manner, potentially
leading to the creation of arbitrary folders in arbitrary locations.
The severity of this vulnerability is heightened by the fact that the
%USERPROFILE% environment variable in the Windows registry can be
modified by standard (or "non-privileged") users. Consequently,
unprivileged actors, including malicious entities or trojans, can
manipulate the environment variable key to deceive the privileged
"msiexec.exe" process. This manipulation can result in the creation of
folders in unintended and potentially malicious locations. It is
important to note that this vulnerability is specific to Windows users
who install Node.js using the .msi installer. Users who opt for other
installation methods are not affected by this particular issue.

A privilege escalation vulnerability exists in Node.js 20 that allowed
loading arbitrary OpenSSL engines when the experimental permission
model is enabled, which can bypass and/or disable the permission
model. The attack complexity is high. However, the crypto.setEngine()
API can be used to bypass the permission model when called with a
compatible OpenSSL engine. The OpenSSL engine can, for example,
disable the permission model in the host process by manipulating the
process's stack memory to locate the permission model
Permission::enabled_ in the host process's heap memory. Please note
that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an
experimental feature of Node.js.

The generateKeys() API function returned from
crypto.createDiffieHellman() only generates missing (or outdated)
keys, that is, it only generates a private key if none has been set
yet, but the function is also needed to compute the corresponding
public key after calling setPrivateKey(). However, the documentation
says this API call: "Generates private and public Diffie-Hellman key
values". The documented behavior is very different from the actual
behavior, and this difference could easily lead to security issues in
applications that use these APIs as the DiffieHellman may be used as
the basis for application-level security, implications are
consequently broad.

Archery is an open source SQL audit platform. The Archery project
contains multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities, that may allow an
attacker to query the connected databases. User input coming from the
`variable_name` and `variable_value` parameter value in the
`sql/instance.py` `param_edit` endpoint is passed to a set of methods
in given SQL engine implementations, which concatenate user input
unsafely into a SQL query and afterwards pass it to the `query` method
of each database engine for execution. The affected methods are:
`set_variable` in `sql/engines/goinception.py` which concatenates
input which is passed to execution on the database in the
`sql/engines/goinception.py`, `get_variables` in
`sql/engines/goinception.py` which concatenates input which is passed
to execution on the database in the `sql/engines/goinception.py`,
`set_variable` in `sql/engines/mysql.py` which concatenates input
which is passed to execution on the database in the
`sql/engines/mysql.py` `query`, and `get_variables` in
`sql/engines/mysql.py`which concatenates input which is passed to
execution on the database in the `sql/engines/mysql.py` `query`. Each
of these issues may be mitigated by escaping user input or by using
prepared statements when executing SQL queries. This advisory is also
indexed as `GHSL-2022-104`.

matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/VoIP
client into a web page. Prior to version 3.71.0, plain text messages
containing HTML tags are rendered as HTML in the search results. To
exploit this, an attacker needs to trick a user into searching for a
specific message containing an HTML injection payload. No cross-site
scripting attack is possible due to the hardcoded content security
policy. Version 3.71.0 of the SDK patches over the issue. As a
workaround, restarting the client will clear the HTML injection.

aws-sigv4 is a rust library for low level request signing in the aws
cloud platform. The `aws_sigv4::SigningParams` struct had a derived
`Debug` implementation. When debug-formatted, it would include a
user's AWS access key, AWS secret key, and security token in
plaintext. When TRACE-level logging is enabled for an SDK,
`SigningParams` is printed, thereby revealing those credentials to
anyone with access to logs. All users of the AWS SDK for Rust who
enabled TRACE-level logging, either globally (e.g. `RUST_LOG=trace`),
or for the `aws-sigv4` crate specifically are affected. This issue has
been addressed in a set of new releases. Users are advised to upgrade.
Users unable to upgrade should disable TRACE-level logging for AWS

Cloud hypervisor is a Virtual Machine Monitor for Cloud workloads.
This vulnerability allows users to close arbitrary open file
descriptors in the Cloud Hypervisor process via sending malicious HTTP
request through the HTTP API socket. As a result, the Cloud Hypervisor
process can be easily crashed, causing Deny-of-Service (DoS). This can
also be a potential Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability. Users require
to have the write access to the API socket file to trigger this
vulnerability. Impacted versions of Cloud Hypervisor include upstream
main branch, v31.0, and v30.0. The vulnerability was initially
detected by our `http_api_fuzzer` via oss-fuzz. This issue has been
addressed in versions 30.1 and 31.1. Users unable to upgrade may
mitigate this issue by ensuring the write access to the API socket
file is granted to trusted users only.

Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system, allows users to
upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. In versions of Kiwi
TCMS prior to 12.2, there is no control over what kinds of files can
be uploaded. Thus, a malicious actor may upload an `.exe` file or a
file containing embedded JavaScript and trick others into clicking on
these files, causing vulnerable browsers to execute malicious code on
another computer. Kiwi TCMS v12.2 comes with functionality that allows
administrators to configure additional upload validator functions
which give them more control over what file types are accepted for
upload. By default `.exe` are denied. Other files containing the
`<script>` tag, regardless of their type are also denied b/c they are
a path to XSS attacks. There are no known workarounds aside from
upgrading.

Kruise provides automated management of large-scale applications on
Kubernetes. Starting in version 0.8.0 and prior to versions 1.3.1,
1.4.1, and 1.5.2, an attacker who has gained root privilege of the
node that kruise-daemon run can leverage the kruise-daemon pod to list
all secrets in the entire cluster. After that, the attacker can
leverage the "captured" secrets (e.g. the kruise-manager service
account token) to gain extra privileges such as pod modification.
Versions 1.3.1, 1.4.1, and 1.5.2 fix this issue. A workaround is
available. For users that do not require imagepulljob functions, they
can modify kruise-daemon-role to drop the cluster level secret
get/list privilege.

mindsdb is a Machine Learning platform to help developers build AI
solutions. In affected versions an unsafe extraction is being
performed using `tarfile.extractall()` from a remotely retrieved
tarball. Which may lead to the writing of the extracted files to an
unintended location. Sometimes, the vulnerability is called a TarSlip
or a ZipSlip variant. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability to
overwrite any local file which the server process has access to. There
is no risk of file exposure with this vulnerability. This issue has
been addressed in release `23.2.1.0 `. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Gipsy is a multi-purpose discord bot which aim to be as modular and
user-friendly as possible. In versions prior to 1.3 users can run
command on the host machine with sudoer permission. The `!ping`
command when provided with an IP or hostname used to run a bash `ping
<IP>` without verification that the IP or hostname was legitimate.
This command was executed with root permissions and may lead to
arbitrary command injection on the host server. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Clusternet is a general-purpose system for controlling Kubernetes
clusters across different environments. An issue in clusternet prior
to version 0.15.2 can be leveraged to lead to a cluster-level
privilege escalation. The clusternet has a deployment called `cluster-
hub` inside the `clusternet-system` Kubernetes namespace, which runs
on worker nodes randomly. The deployment has a service account called
`clusternet-hub`, which has a cluster role called `clusternet:hub` via
cluster role binding. The `clusternet:hub` cluster role has `"*" verbs
of "*.*"` resources. Thus, if a malicious user can access the worker
node which runs the clusternet, they can leverage the service account
to do malicious actions to critical system resources. For example, the
malicious user can leverage the service account to get ALL secrets in
the entire cluster, resulting in cluster-level privilege escalation.
Version 0.15.2 contains a fix for this issue.

`embano1/wip` is a GitHub Action written in Bash. Prior to version 2,
the `embano1/wip` action uses the `github.event.pull_request.title`
parameter in an insecure way. The title parameter is used in a run
statement - resulting in a command injection vulnerability due to
string interpolation. This vulnerability can be triggered by any user
on GitHub. They just need to create a pull request with a commit
message containing an exploit. (Note that first-time PR requests will
not be run - but the attacker can submit a valid PR before submitting
an invalid PR). The commit can be genuine, but the commit message can
be malicious. This can be used to execute code on the GitHub runners
and can be used to exfiltrate any secrets used in the CI pipeline,
including repository tokens. Version 2 has a fix for this issue.

Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to versions
6.0.2, 7.0.1, and 8.0.1, Wasmtime's implementation of managing per-
instance state, such as tables and memories, contains LLVM-level
undefined behavior. This undefined behavior was found to cause
runtime-level issues when compiled with LLVM 16 which causes some
writes, which are critical for correctness, to be optimized away.
Vulnerable versions of Wasmtime compiled with Rust 1.70, which is
currently in beta, or later are known to have incorrectly compiled
functions. Versions of Wasmtime compiled with the current Rust stable
release, 1.69, and prior are not known at this time to have any
issues, but can theoretically exhibit potential issues. The underlying
problem is that Wasmtime's runtime state for an instance involves a
Rust-defined structure called `Instance` which has a trailing
`VMContext` structure after it. This `VMContext` structure has a
runtime-defined layout that is unique per-module. This representation
cannot be expressed with safe code in Rust so `unsafe` code is
required to maintain this state. The code doing this, however, has
methods which take `&self` as an argument but modify data in the
`VMContext` part of the allocation. This means that pointers derived
from `&self` are mutated. This is typically not allowed, except in the
presence of `UnsafeCell`, in Rust. When compiled to LLVM these
functions have `noalias readonly` parameters which means it's UB to
write through the pointers. Wasmtime's internal representation and
management of `VMContext` has been updated to use `&mut self` methods
where appropriate. Additionally verification tools for `unsafe` code
in Rust, such as `cargo miri`, are planned to be executed on the
`main` branch soon to fix any Rust-level issues that may be exploited
in future compiler versions. Precomplied binaries available for
Wasmtime from GitHub releases have been compiled with at most LLVM 15
so are not known to be vulnerable. As mentioned above, however, it's
still recommended to update. Wasmtime version 6.0.2, 7.0.1, and 8.0.1
have been issued which contain the patch necessary to work correctly
on LLVM 16 and have no known UB on LLVM 15 and earlier. If Wasmtime is
compiled with Rust 1.69 and prior, which use LLVM 15, then there are
no known issues. There is a theoretical possibility for undefined
behavior to exploited, however, so it's recommended that users upgrade
to a patched version of Wasmtime. Users using beta Rust (1.70 at this
time) or nightly Rust (1.71 at this time) must update to a patched
version to work correctly.

Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In kiwitcms/Kiwi
v12.2 and prior and kiwitcms/enterprise v12.2 and prior, the
`changelog.yml` workflow is vulnerable to command injection attacks
because of using an untrusted `github.head_ref` field. The
`github.head_ref` value is an attacker-controlled value. Assigning the
value to `zzz";echo${IFS}"hello";#` can lead to command injection.
Since the permission is not restricted, the attacker has a write-

Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual
machine. In versions 0.3.1 through 0.3.7, the Vyper compiler generates
the wrong bytecode. Any contract that uses the `raw_call` with
`revert_on_failure=False` and `max_outsize=0` receives the wrong
response from `raw_call`. Depending on the memory garbage, the result
can be either `True` or `False`. A patch is available and, as of time
of publication, anticipated to be part of Vyper 0.3.8. As a
workaround, one may always put `max_outsize>0`.

An issue was discovered in TrEEConfigDriver in Insyde InsydeH2O with
kernel 5.0 through 5.5. It can report false TPM PCR values, and thus
mask malware activity. Devices use Platform Configuration Registers
(PCRs) to record information about device and software configuration
to ensure that the boot process is secure. (For example, Windows uses
these PCR measurements to determine device health.) A vulnerable
device can masquerade as a healthy device by extending arbitrary
values into Platform Configuration Register (PCR) banks. This requires
physical access to a target victim's device, or compromise of user
credentials for a device. This issue is similar to CVE-2021-42299 (on

PrestaShop is an Open Source e-commerce web application. Prior to
versions 8.0.4 and 1.7.8.9, the `ValidateCore::isCleanHTML()` method
of Prestashop misses hijackable events which can lead to cross-site
scripting (XSS) injection, allowed by the presence of pre-setup
`@keyframes` methods. This XSS, which hijacks HTML attributes, can be
triggered without any interaction by the visitor/administrator, which
makes it as dangerous as a trivial XSS attack. Contrary to other
attacks which target HTML attributes and are triggered without user
interaction (such as onload / onerror which suffer from a very limited
scope), this one can hijack every HTML element, which increases the
danger due to a complete HTML elements scope. Versions 8.0.4 and
1.7.8.9 contain a fix for this issue.

Fluid is an open source Kubernetes-native distributed dataset
orchestrator and accelerator for data-intensive applications. Starting
in version 0.7.0 and prior to version 0.8.6, if a malicious user gains
control of a Kubernetes node running fluid csi pod (controlled by the
`csi-nodeplugin-fluid` node-daemonset), they can leverage the fluid-
csi service account to modify specs of all the nodes in the cluster.
However, since this service account lacks `list node` permissions, the
attacker may need to use other techniques to identify vulnerable
nodes. Once the attacker identifies and modifies the node specs, they
can manipulate system-level-privileged components to access all
secrets in the cluster or execute pods on other nodes. This allows
them to elevate privileges beyond the compromised node and potentially
gain full privileged access to the whole cluster. To exploit this
vulnerability, the attacker can make all other nodes unschedulable
(for example, patch node with taints) and wait for system-critical
components with high privilege to appear on the compromised node.
However, this attack requires two prerequisites: a compromised node
and identifying all vulnerable nodes through other means. Version
0.8.6 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, delete the
`csi-nodeplugin-fluid` daemonset in `fluid-system` namespace and avoid
using CSI mode to mount FUSE file systems. Alternatively, using
sidecar mode to mount FUSE file systems is recommended.

Baremetal Operator (BMO) is a bare metal host provisioning integration

deployed within Baremetal Operator using the included `deploy.sh`
store their `.htpasswd` files as ConfigMaps instead of Secrets. This
causes the plain-text username and hashed password to be readable by
anyone having a cluster-wide read-access to the management cluster, or
access to the management cluster's Etcd storage. This issue is patched
in baremetal-operator PR#1241, and is included in BMO release 0.3.0
onwards. As a workaround, users may modify the kustomizations and
redeploy the BMO, or recreate the required ConfigMaps as Secrets per
instructions in baremetal-operator PR#1241.

Mutagen provides real-time file synchronization and flexible network
forwarding for developers. Prior to versions 0.16.6 and 0.17.1 in
`mutagen` and prior to version 0.17.1 in `mutagen-compose`, Mutagen
`list` and `monitor` commands are susceptible to control characters
that could be provided by remote endpoints. This could cause terminal
corruption, either intentional or unintentional, if these characters
were present in error messages or file paths/names. This could be used
as an attack vector if synchronizing with an untrusted remote
endpoint, synchronizing files not under control of the user, or
forwarding to/from an untrusted remote endpoint. On very old systems
with terminals susceptible to issues such as CVE-2003-0069, the issue
could theoretically cause code execution. The problem has been patched
in Mutagen v0.16.6 and v0.17.1. Earlier versions of Mutagen are no
longer supported and will not be patched. Versions of Mutagen after
v0.18.0 will also have the patch merged. As a workaround, avoiding
synchronization of untrusted files or interaction with untrusted
remote endpoints should mitigate any risk.

ESPv2 is a service proxy that provides API management capabilities
using Google Service Infrastructure. ESPv2 2.20.0 through 2.42.0
contains an authentication bypass vulnerability. API clients can craft
a malicious `X-HTTP-Method-Override` header value to bypass JWT
authentication in specific cases. ESPv2 allows malicious requests to
bypass authentication if both the conditions are true: The requested
HTTP method is **not** in the API service definition (OpenAPI spec or
gRPC `google.api.http` proto annotations, and the specified `X-HTTP-
Method-Override` is a valid HTTP method in the API service definition.
ESPv2 will forward the request to your backend without checking the
JWT. Attackers can craft requests with a malicious `X-HTTP-Method-
Override` value that allows them to bypass specifying JWTs.
Restricting API access with API keys works as intended and is not
affected by this vulnerability. Upgrade deployments to release v2.43.0
or higher to receive a patch. This release ensures that JWT
authentication occurs, even when the caller specifies `x-http-method-
override`. `x-http-method-override` is still supported by v2.43.0+.
API clients can continue sending this header to ESPv2.

typed-rest-client is a library for Node Rest and Http Clients with
typings for use with TypeScript. Users of the typed-rest-client
library version 1.7.3 or lower are vulnerable to leak authentication
data to 3rd parties. The flow of the vulnerability is as follows:
First, send any request with `BasicCredentialHandler`,
`BearerCredentialHandler` or `PersonalAccessTokenCredentialHandler`.
Second, the target host may return a redirection (3xx), with a link to
a second host. Third, the next request will use the credentials to
authenticate with the second host, by setting the `Authorization`
header. The expected behavior is that the next request will *NOT* set
the `Authorization` header. The problem was fixed in version 1.8.0.
There are no known workarounds.

Pimcore is an open source data and experience management platform.
Prior to version 10.5.21, the `/admin/misc/script-proxy` API endpoint
that is accessible by an authenticated administrator user is
vulnerable to arbitrary JavaScript and CSS file read via the
`scriptPath` and `scripts` parameters. The `scriptPath` parameter is
not sanitized properly and is vulnerable to path traversal attack. Any
JavaScript/CSS file from the application server can be read by
specifying sufficient number of `../` patterns to go out from the
application webroot followed by path of the folder where the file is
located in the "scriptPath" parameter and the file name in the
"scripts" parameter. The JavaScript file is successfully read only if
the web application has read access to it. Users should update to
version 10.5.21 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, apply the

Gradle Build Action allows users to execute a Gradle Build in their
GitHub Actions workflow. A vulnerability impacts GitHub workflows
using the Gradle Build Action prior to version 2.4.2 that have
executed the Gradle Build Tool with the configuration cache enabled,
potentially exposing secrets configured for the repository. Secrets
configured for GitHub Actions are normally passed to the Gradle Build
Tool via environment variables. Due to the way that the Gradle Build
Tool records these environment variables, they may be persisted into
an entry in the GitHub Actions cache. This data stored in the GitHub
Actions cache can be read by a GitHub Actions workflow running in an
untrusted context, such as that running for a Pull Request submitted
by a developer via a repository fork. This vulnerability was
discovered internally through code review, and we have not seen any
evidence of it being exploited in the wild. However, in addition to
upgrading the Gradle Build Action, affected users should delete any
potentially vulnerable cache entries and may choose to rotate any
potentially affected secrets. Gradle Build Action v2.4.2 and newer no
longer saves this sensitive data for later use, preventing ongoing
leakage of secrets via the GitHub Actions Cache. While upgrading to
the latest version of the Gradle Build Action will prevent leakage of
secrets going forward, additional actions may be required due to
current or previous GitHub Actions Cache entries containing this
information. Current cache entries will remain vulnerable until they
are forcibly deleted or they expire naturally after 7 days of not
being used. Potentially vulnerable entries can be easily identified in
the GitHub UI by searching for a cache entry with key matching
`configuration-cache-*`. The maintainers recommend that users of the
Gradle Build Action inspect their list of cache entries and manually
delete any that match this pattern. While maintainers have not seen
any evidence of this vulnerability being exploited, they recommend
cycling any repository secrets if you cannot be certain that these
have not been compromised. Compromise could occur if a user runs a
GitHub Actions workflow for a pull request attempting to exploit this
data. Warning signs to look for in a pull request include: - Making
changes to GitHub Actions workflow files in a way that may attempt to
read/extract data from the Gradle User Home or `<project-
root>/.gradle` directories. - Making changes to Gradle build files or
other executable files that may be invoked by a GitHub Actions
workflow, in a way that may attempt to read/extract information from
these locations. Some workarounds to limit the impact of this
vulnerability are available: - If the Gradle project does not opt-in
to using the configuration cache, then it is not vulnerable. - If the
Gradle project does opt-in to using the configuration-cache by
default, then the `--no-configuration-cache` command-line argument can
be used to disable this feature in a GitHub Actions workflow. In any
case, we recommend that users carefully inspect any pull request
before approving the execution of GitHub Actions workflows. It may be
prudent to require approval for all PRs from external contributors.

Triton is a Minecraft plugin for Spigot and BungeeCord that helps you
translate your Minecraft server. The CustomPayload packet allows you
to execute commands on the spigot/bukkit console. When you enable
bungee mode in the config it will enable the bungee bridge and the
server will begin to broadcast the 'triton:main' plugin channel. Using
this plugin channel you are able to send a payload packet containing a
byte (2) and a string (any spigot command). This could be used to make
yourself a server operator and be used to extract other user
information through phishing (pretending to be an admin), many servers
use essentials so the /geoip command could be available to them, etc.
This could also be modified to allow you to set the servers language,
set another players language, etc. This issue affects those who have
bungee enabled in config. This issue has been fixed in version 3.8.4.

Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework. When all of the
following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for
one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other
clients. If the proxy also caches `Set-Cookie` headers, it may send
one client's `session` cookie to other clients. The severity depends
on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior
regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met.
1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not
strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies. 2. The application
sets `session.permanent = True` 3. The application does not access or
modify the session at any point during a request. 4.
`SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST` enabled (the default). 5. The
application does not set a `Cache-Control` header to indicate that a
page is private or should not be cached. This happens because
vulnerable versions of Flask only set the `Vary: Cookie` header when
the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent
to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified. This
issue has been fixed in versions 2.3.2 and 2.2.5.

In the Streampark platform, when users log in to the system and use
certain features, some pages provide a name-based fuzzy search, such
as job names, role names, etc. The sql syntax :select * from table
where jobName like '%jobName%'. However, the jobName field may receive
illegal parameters, leading to SQL injection. This could potentially
result in information leakage. Mitigation: Users are recommended to
upgrade to version 2.1.2, which fixes the issue.

SQL injection in Log4cxx when using the ODBC appender to send log
messages to a database. No fields sent to the database were properly
escaped for SQL injection. This has been the case since at least
version 0.9.0(released 2003-08-06) Note that Log4cxx is a C++
framework, so only C++ applications are affected. Before version
1.1.0, the ODBC appender was automatically part of Log4cxx if the
library was found when compiling the library. As of version 1.1.0,
this must be both explicitly enabled in order to be compiled in. Three
preconditions must be met for this vulnerability to be possible: 1.
Log4cxx compiled with ODBC support(before version 1.1.0, this was
auto-detected at compile time) 2. ODBCAppender enabled for logging

at some point. If your application does not have user input, it is
unlikely to be affected. Users are recommended to upgrade to version
1.1.0 which properly binds the parameters to the SQL statement, or
migrate to the new DBAppender class which supports an ODBC connection
in addition to other databases. Note that this fix does require a
configuration file update, as the old configuration files will not
configure properly. An example is shown below, and more information
may be found in the Log4cxx documentation on the ODBCAppender. Example
of old configuration snippet: <appender name="SqlODBCAppender"
class="ODBCAppender"> <param name="sql" value="INSERT INTO logs
(message) VALUES ('%m')" /> ... other params here ... </appender> The
migrated configuration snippet with new ColumnMapping parameters:
<appender name="SqlODBCAppender" class="ODBCAppender"> <param
name="sql" value="INSERT INTO logs (message) VALUES (?)" /> <param
name="ColumnMapping" value="message"/> ... other params here ...

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/08/1

Security vulnerability in Apache bRPC <1.5.0 on all platforms allows
attackers to execute arbitrary code via ServerOptions::pid_file. An
attacker that can influence the ServerOptions pid_file parameter with
which the bRPC server is started can execute arbitrary code with the
permissions of the bRPC process. Solution: 1. upgrade to bRPC >=
1.5.0, download link:
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/brpc/1.5.0/
https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/brpc/1.5.0/ 2. If you are

`effectindex/tripreporter` is a community-powered, universal platform
for submitting and analyzing trip reports. Prior to commit
bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b, any user with an account on
an instance of `effectindex/tripreporter`, e.g. `subjective.report`,
may be affected by an improper password verification vulnerability.
The vulnerability allows any user with a password matching the
password requirements to log in as any user. This allows access to
accounts / data loss of the user. This issue is patched in commit
bd80ba833b9023d39ca22e29874296c8729dd53b. No action necessary for
users of `subjective.report`, and anyone running their own instance
should update to this commit or newer as soon as possible. As a
workaround, someone running their own instance may apply the patch
manually.

c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When cross-compiling
c-ares and using the autotools build system, CARES_RANDOM_FILE will
not be set, as seen when cross compiling aarch64 android. This will
downgrade to using rand() as a fallback which could allow an attacker
to take advantage of the lack of entropy by not using a CSPRNG. This
issue was patched in version 1.19.1.

Engine.IO is the implementation of transport-based cross-
browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO.
An uncaught exception vulnerability was introduced in version 5.1.0
and included in version 4.1.0 of the `socket.io` parent package. Older
versions are not impacted. A specially crafted HTTP request can
trigger an uncaught exception on the Engine.IO server, thus killing
the Node.js process. This impacts all the users of the `engine.io`
package, including those who use depending packages like `socket.io`.
This issue was fixed in version 6.4.2 of Engine.IO. There is no known
workaround except upgrading to a safe version.

`org.xwiki.commons:xwiki-commons-xml` is an XML library used by the
open-source wiki platform XWiki. The HTML sanitizer, introduced in
version 14.6-rc-1, allows the injection of arbitrary HTML code and
thus cross-site scripting via invalid data attributes. This
vulnerability does not affect restricted cleaning in HTMLCleaner as
there attributes are cleaned and thus characters like `/` and `>` are
removed in all attribute names. This problem has been patched in XWiki
14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by making sure that data attributes only contain
allowed characters. There are no known workarounds apart from
upgrading to a version including the fix.

libspdm is a sample implementation that follows the DMTF SPDM
specifications. A vulnerability has been identified in SPDM session
establishment in libspdm prior to version 2.3.1. If a device supports
both DHE session and PSK session with mutual authentication, the
attacker may be able to establish the session with `KEY_EXCHANGE` and
`PSK_FINISH` to bypass the mutual authentication. This is most likely
to happen when the Requester begins a session using one method (DHE,
for example) and then uses the other method's finish (PSK_FINISH in
this example) to establish the session. The session hashes would be
expected to fail in this case, but the condition was not detected.
This issue only impacts the SPDM responder, which supports
`KEY_EX_CAP=1 and `PSK_CAP=10b` at same time with mutual
authentication requirement. The SPDM requester is not impacted. The
SPDM responder is not impacted if `KEY_EX_CAP=0` or `PSK_CAP=0` or
`PSK_CAP=01b`. The SPDM responder is not impacted if mutual
authentication is not required. libspdm 1.0, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 are
all impacted. Older branches are not maintained, but users of the 2.3
branch may receive a patch in version 2.3.2. The SPDM specification
(DSP0274) does not contain this vulnerability.

NextCloud Cookbook is a recipe library app. Prior to commit a46d9855
on the `master` branch and commit 489bb744 on the `main-0.9.x` branch,
the `pull-checks.yml` workflow is vulnerable to command injection
attacks because of using an untrusted `github.head_ref` field. The
`github.head_ref` value is an attacker-controlled value. Assigning the
value to `zzz";echo${IFS}"hello";#` can lead to command injection.
Since the permission is not restricted, the attacker has a write-
access to the repository. This issue is fixed in commit a46d9855 on
the `master` branch and commit 489bb744 on the `main-0.9.x` branch.
There is no risk for the user of the app within the NextCloud server.
This only affects the main repository and possible forks of it. Those
who have forked the NextCloud Cookbook repository should make sure
their forks are on the latest version to prevent code injection
attacks and similar.

The Contiki-NG operating system versions 4.8 and prior can be
triggered to dereference a NULL pointer in the message handling code
for IPv6 router solicitiations. Contiki-NG contains an implementation
of IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) in the module `os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c`.
The ND protocol includes a message type called Router Solicitation
(RS), which is used to locate routers and update their address
information via the SLLAO (Source Link-Layer Address Option). If the
indicated source address changes, a given neighbor entry is set to the
STALE state. The message handler does not check for RS messages with
an SLLAO that indicates a link-layer address change that a neighbor
entry can actually be created for the indicated address. The resulting
pointer is used without a check, leading to the dereference of a NULL
pointer of type `uip_ds6_nbr_t`. The problem has been patched in the
`develop` branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in the upcoming
4.9 release. As a workaround, users can apply Contiki-NG pull request
#2271 to patch the problem directly.

c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. ares_inet_net_pton() is
vulnerable to a buffer underflow for certain ipv6 addresses, in
particular "0::00:00:00/2" was found to cause an issue. C-ares only

require an administrator to configure such an address via
ares_set_sortlist(). However, users may externally use
ares_inet_net_pton() for other purposes and thus be vulnerable to more
severe issues. This issue has been fixed in 1.19.1.

Tauri is software for building applications for multi-platform
deployment. The Tauri IPC is usually strictly isolated from external
websites, but in versions 1.0.0 until 1.0.9, 1.1.0 until 1.1.4, and
1.2.0 until 1.2.5, the isolation can be bypassed by redirecting an
existing Tauri window to an external website. This is either possible
by an application implementing a feature for users to visit arbitrary
websites or due to a bug allowing the open redirect. This allows the
external website access to the IPC layer and therefore to all
configured and exposed Tauri API endpoints and application specific
implemented Tauri commands. This issue has been patched in versions
1.0.9, 1.1.4, and 1.2.5. As a workaround, prevent arbitrary input in
redirect features and/or only allow trusted websites access to the
IPC.

Dgraph is an open source distributed GraphQL database. Existing Dgraph
audit logs are vulnerable to brute force attacks due to nonce
collisions. The first 12 bytes come from a baseIv which is initialized
when an audit log is created. The last 4 bytes come from the length of
the log line being encrypted. This is problematic because two log
lines will often have the same length, so due to these collisions we
are reusing the same nonce many times. All audit logs generated by
versions of Dgraph <v23.0.0 are affected. Attackers must have access
to the system the logs are stored on. Dgraph users should upgrade to
v23.0.0. Users unable to upgrade should store existing audit logs in a
secure location and for extra security, encrypt using an external tool
like `gpg`.

MaraDNS is open-source software that implements the Domain Name System
(DNS). In version 3.5.0024 and prior, a remotely exploitable integer
underflow vulnerability in the DNS packet decompression function
allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service by triggering an
abnormal program termination. The vulnerability exists in the
`decomp_get_rddata` function within the `Decompress.c` file. When
handling a DNS packet with an Answer RR of qtype 16 (TXT record) and
any qclass, if the `rdlength` is smaller than `rdata`, the result of
the line `Decompress.c:886` is a negative number `len = rdlength -
total;`. This value is then passed to the `decomp_append_bytes`
function without proper validation, causing the program to attempt to
allocate a massive chunk of memory that is impossible to allocate.
Consequently, the program exits with an error code of 64, causing a
Denial of Service. One proposed fix for this vulnerability is to patch
`Decompress.c:887` by breaking `if(len <= 0)`, which has been
incorporated in version 3.5.0036 via commit
bab062bde40b2ae8a91eecd522e84d8b993bab58.

DHIS2 Core contains the service layer and Web API for DHIS2, an
information system for data capture. Starting in the 2.36 branch and
prior to versions 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, and 2.39.1.2, using object model
traversal in the payload of a PATCH request, authenticated users with
write access to an object may be able to modify related objects that
they should not have access to. DHIS2 implementers should upgrade to a
supported version of DHIS2 to receive a patch: 2.37.9.1, 2.38.3.1, or
2.39.1.2. It is possible to work around this issue by blocking all
PATCH requests on a reverse proxy, but this may cause some issues with
the functionality of built-in applications using legacy PATCH
requests.

Terraform Enterprise since v202207-1 did not properly implement
authorization rules for agent pools, allowing the workspace to be
targeted by unauthorized agents. This authorization flaw could
potentially allow a workspace to access resources from a separate,
higher-privileged workspace in the same organization that targeted an
agent pool. This vulnerability, CVE-2023-3114, is fixed in Terraform
Enterprise v202306-1.

OpenProject is open source project management software. Starting with
version 7.4.0 and prior to version 12.5.4, when a user registers and
confirms their first two-factor authentication (2FA) device for an
account, existing logged in sessions for that user account are not
terminated. Likewise, if an administrators creates a mobile phone 2FA
device on behalf of a user, their existing sessions are not
terminated. The issue has been resolved in OpenProject version 12.5.4
by actively terminating sessions of user accounts having registered
and confirmed a 2FA device. As a workaround, users who register the
first 2FA device on their account can manually log out to terminate
all other active sessions. This is the default behavior of OpenProject
but might be disabled through a configuration option. Double check
that this option is not overridden if one plans to employ the
workaround.

is an issue with the implementation of fine-grained access control
rules (document-level security, field-level security and field
masking) where they are not correctly applied to the queries during
extremely rare race conditions potentially leading to incorrect access
authorization. For this issue to be triggered, two concurrent requests
need to land on the same instance exactly when query cache eviction
happens, once every four hours. OpenSearch 1.3.10 and 2.7.0 contain a

Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite based on
LibreOffice technology. This vulnerability report describes a
reflected XSS vulnerability with full CSP bypass in Nextcloud
installations using the recommended bundle. The vulnerability can be
exploited to perform a trivial account takeover attack. The
vulnerability allows attackers to inject malicious code into web
pages, which can be executed in the context of the victim's browser
session. This means that an attacker can steal sensitive data, such as
login credentials or personal information, or perform unauthorized
actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying or deleting data.
In this specific case, the vulnerability allows for a trivial account
takeover attack. An attacker can exploit the vulnerability to inject
code into the victim's browser session, allowing the attacker to take
over the victim's account without their knowledge or consent. This can
lead to unauthorized access to sensitive information and data, as well
as the ability to perform actions on behalf of the victim.
Furthermore, the fact that the vulnerability bypasses the Content
Security Policy (CSP) makes it more dangerous, as CSP is an important
security mechanism used to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. By
bypassing CSP, attackers can circumvent the security measures put in
place by the web application and execute their malicious code. This
issue has been patched in versions 22.05.13, 21.11.9, and 6.4.27.
Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual
machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, during codegen, the length word of a
dynarray is written before the data, which can result in out-of-bounds
array access in the case where the dynarray is on both the lhs and rhs
of an assignment. The issue can cause data corruption across call
frames. The expected behavior is to revert due to out-of-bounds array
access. Version 0.3.8 contains a patch for this issue.

c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. When /dev/urandom or
RtlGenRandom() are unavailable, c-ares uses rand() to generate random
numbers used for DNS query ids. This is not a CSPRNG, and it is also
not seeded by srand() so will generate predictable output. Input from
the random number generator is fed into a non-compilant RC4
implementation and may not be as strong as the original RC4
implementation. No attempt is made to look for modern OS-provided
CSPRNGs like arc4random() that is widely available. This issue has
been fixed in version 1.19.1.

DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver from BlueMark Innovations is
affected by an Improper Authentication vulnerability during the
firmware update procedure. Specifically, the firmware update procedure
ignores and does not check the validity of the TLS certificate of the
HTTPS endpoint from which the firmware update package (.tar.bz2 file)
is downloaded. An attacker with the ability to put himself in a Man-
in-the-Middle situation (e.g., DNS poisoning, ARP poisoning, control
of a node on the route to the endpoint, etc.) can trick the DroneScout
ds230 to install a crafted malicious firmware update containing
arbitrary files (e.g., executable and configuration) and gain
administrative (root) privileges on the underlying Linux operating
system. This issue affects DroneScout ds230 firmware from version
20211210-1627 through 20230329-1042.

DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver from BlueMark Innovations is
affected by an information loss vulnerability through traffic
injection. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by injecting, on
carefully selected channels, high power spoofed Open Drone ID (ODID)
messages which force the DroneScout ds230 Remote ID receiver to drop
real Remote ID (RID) information and, instead, generate and transmit
JSON encoded MQTT messages containing crafted RID information.
Consequently, the MQTT broker, typically operated by a system
integrator, will have no access to the drones&#8217; real RID information.
This issue affects the adjacent channel suppression algorithm present
in DroneScout ds230 firmware from version 20211210-1627 through
20230329-1042.

value as an input seed, resulting in only four billion possible
mnemonics. The affected versions of the browser extension are 0.0.172
through 0.0.182. To steal funds efficiently, an attacker can identify
all Ethereum addresses created since the 0.0.172 release, and check
whether they are Ethereum addresses that could have been created by
this extension. To respond to the risk, affected users need to upgrade
the product version and also move funds to a new wallet address.
