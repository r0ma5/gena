2.1 through 5.2 may permit a nearby man-in-the-middle attacker to
identify the Passkey used during pairing (in the Passkey
authentication procedure) by reflection of the public key and the
authentication evidence of the initiating device, potentially
permitting this attacker to complete authenticated pairing with the
responding device using the correct Passkey for the pairing session.
The attack methodology determines the Passkey value one bit at a time.

Reference: MISC:https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-3.1.2.3

ApiFest OAuth 2.0 Server 0.3.1 does not validate the redirect URI in
accordance with RFC 6749 and is susceptible to an open redirector
attack. Specifically, it directly sends an authorization code to the
redirect URI submitted with the authorization request, without
checking whether the redirect URI is registered by the client who
initiated the request. This allows an attacker to craft a request with
a manipulated redirect URI (redirect_uri parameter), which is under
the attacker's control, and consequently obtain the leaked
authorization code when the server redirects the client to the
manipulated redirect URI with an authorization code. NOTE: this is
similar to CVE-2019-3778.

received HTLC output, it didn't verify that the corresponding outgoing
off-chain HTLC was already settled before releasing the preimage. In
the case of a hash-and-amount collision with an invoice, the preimage
for an expected payment was instead released. A malicious peer could
have deliberately intercepted an HTLC intended for the victim node,
probed the preimage through a colluding relayed HTLC, and stolen the
intercepted HTLC. The impact is a loss of funds in certain situations,

("[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9+.-]+:") before making a redirection. This allows
a malicious client to pass an XSS payload through the redirect_uri
parameter while making an authorization request. NOTE: this
vulnerability is similar to CVE-2020-7741.

In Legion of the Bouncy Castle BC before 1.61 and BC-FJA before
1.0.1.2, attackers can obtain sensitive information about a private
exponent because of Observable Differences in Behavior to Error
Inputs. This occurs in org.bouncycastle.crypto.encodings.OAEPEncoding.
Sending invalid ciphertext that decrypts to a short payload in the
OAEP Decoder could result in the throwing of an early exception,
potentially leaking some information about the private exponent of the
RSA private key performing the encryption.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/24/5

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 5.11.8.
kernel/bpf/verifier.c has an off-by-one error (with a resultant
integer underflow) affecting out-of-bounds speculation on pointer
arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat Spectre
mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel memory, aka
CID-10d2bb2e6b1d.

In Eclipse Jetty versions 1.0 thru 9.4.32.v20200930, 10.0.0.alpha1
thru 10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha1 thru 11.0.0.beta2O, on Unix like
systems, the system's temporary directory is shared between all users
on that system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating
a temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race
to complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. If the
attacker wins the race then they will have read and write permission
to the subdirectory used to unpack web applications, including their
WEB-INF/lib jar files and JSP files. If any code is ever executed out
of this temporary directory, this can lead to a local privilege
escalation vulnerability.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-27217
Status: Candidate
Reference: CONFIRM:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=567068
Reference: URL:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=567068

In Eclipse Hono version 1.3.0 and 1.4.0 the AMQP protocol adapter does
not verify the size of AMQP messages received from devices. In
particular, a device may send messages that are bigger than the max-
message-size that the protocol adapter has indicated during link
establishment. While the AMQP 1.0 protocol explicitly disallows a peer
to send such messages, a hand crafted AMQP 1.0 client could exploit
this behavior in order to send a message of unlimited size to the
adapter, eventually causing the adapter to fail with an out of memory
exception.

In Eclipse Jetty version 9.4.0.RC0 to 9.4.34.v20201102, 10.0.0.alpha0
to 10.0.0.beta2, and 11.0.0.alpha0 to 11.0.0.beta2, if GZIP request
body inflation is enabled and requests from different clients are
multiplexed onto a single connection, and if an attacker can send a
request with a body that is received entirely but not consumed by the
application, then a subsequent request on the same connection will see
that body prepended to its body. The attacker will not see any data
but may inject data into the body of the subsequent request.

Vulnerability in the Oracle FLEXCUBE Investor Servicing product of
Oracle Financial Services Applications (component: Infrastructure).
Supported versions that are affected are 12.1.0-12.4.0 and
14.0.0-14.1.0. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated
attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle FLEXCUBE
Investor Servicing. Successful attacks require human interaction from
a person other than the attacker. Successful attacks of this
vulnerability can result in unauthorized update, insert or delete
access to some of Oracle FLEXCUBE Investor Servicing accessible data
as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of Oracle FLEXCUBE
Investor Servicing accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 5.4
(Confidentiality and Integrity impacts). CVSS Vector:

Reference: URL:https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=569856

The Eclipse Hono AMQP and MQTT protocol adapters do not check whether
an authenticated gateway device is authorized to receive command &
control messages when it has subscribed only to commands for a
specific device. The missing check involves verifying that the command
target device is configured giving permission for the gateway device
to act on its behalf. This means an authenticated device of a certain
tenant, notably also a non-gateway device acting like a gateway, may
receive command & control messages targeted at a different device of
the same tenant without corresponding permissions getting checked.

In Eclipse Californium version 2.3.0 to 2.6.0, the certificate based
(x509 and RPK) DTLS handshakes accidentally fails, because the DTLS
server side sticks to a wrong internal state. That wrong internal
state is set by a previous certificate based DTLS handshake failure
with TLS parameter mismatch. The DTLS server side must be restarted to
recover this. This allow clients to force a DoS.

A vulnerability in the TCL Android Smart TV series V8-R851T02-LF1 V295
and below and V8-T658T01-LF1 V373 and below by TCL Technology Group
Corporation allows an attacker on the adjacent network to arbitrarily
browse and download sensitive files over an insecure web server
running on port 7989 that lists all files & directories. An
unprivileged remote attacker on the adjacent network, can download
most system files, leading to serious critical information disclosure.
Also, some TV models and/or FW versions may expose the webserver with
the entire filesystem accessible on another port. For example, nmap
scan for all ports run directly from the TV model U43P6046 (Android
8.0) showed port 7983 not mentioned in the original CVE description,
but containing the same directory listing of the entire filesystem.
This webserver is bound (at least) to localhost interface and
accessible freely to all unprivileged installed apps on the Android
such as a regular web browser. Any app can therefore read any files of
any other apps including Android system settings including sensitive
data such as saved passwords, private keys etc.

Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Array index error.
The component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the
vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ
application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter
trusts the offset provided for the stack value duplication
instruction, DUP. The offset is unchecked and memory prior to the
start of the execution stack can be read and treated as a TVM object.
A successful exploit could use the vulnerability to leak runtime
information such as the heap handle or pointer for a number of TVM
context variables. Some reachable values may be controlled enough to
forge a TVM object on the stack, leading to possible remote code

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2020-0004.md

Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Integer Overflow.
The component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the
vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ
application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter
fails to check for overflow when allocating the array for the NEWA
instruction. This a constrained read/write primitive across the entire
MAX32630 address space. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ
app store application to escape and perform activities outside the
restricted application execution environment.

Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Array index error.
The component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the
vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ
application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter
fails to check the index provided when accessing the local variable in
the LGETV and LPUTV instructions. This provides the ability to both
read and write memory outside the bounds of the TVM context
allocation. It can be leveraged to construct a use-after-free
scenario, leading to a constrained read/write primitive across the
entire MAX32630 address space. A successful exploit would allow a
ConnectIQ app store application to escape and perform activities
outside the restricted application execution environment.

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/atredispartners/advisories/blob/master/ATREDIS-2020-0006.md

Garmin Forerunner 235 before 8.20 is affected by: Buffer Overflow. The
component is: ConnectIQ TVM. The attack vector is: To exploit the
vulnerability, the attacker must upload a malicious ConnectIQ
application to the ConnectIQ store. The ConnectIQ program interpreter
trusts the string length provided in the data section of the PRG file.
It allocates memory for the string immediately, and then copies the
string into the TVM object by using a function similar to strcpy. This
copy can exceed the length of the allocated string data and overwrite
heap data. A successful exploit would allow a ConnectIQ app store
application to escape and perform activities outside the restricted
application execution environment.

Loxone Miniserver devices with firmware before 11.1 (aka 11.1.9.3) are
unable to use an authentication method that is based on the "signature
of the update package." Therefore, these devices (or attackers who are
spoofing these devices) can continue to use an unauthenticated cloud
service for an indeterminate time period (possibly forever). Once an
individual device's firmware is updated, and authentication occurs
once, the cloud service recategorizes the device so that
authentication is subsequently always required, and spoofing cannot
occur.

In IntensityCompare() of /magick/quantize.c, there are calls to
PixelPacketIntensity() which could return overflowed values to the
caller when ImageMagick processes a crafted input file. To mitigate
this, the patch introduces and uses the ConstrainPixelIntensity()
function, which forces the pixel intensities to be within the proper
bounds in the event of an overflow. This flaw affects ImageMagick
versions prior to 6.9.10-69 and 7.0.8-69.

in SetImageExtent() of /MagickCore/image.c, an incorrect image depth
size can cause a memory leak because the code which checks for the
proper image depth size does not reset the size in the event there is
an invalid size. The patch resets the depth to a proper size before
throwing an exception. The memory leak can be triggered by a crafted
input file that is processed by ImageMagick and could cause an impact
to application reliability, such as denial of service. This flaw
affects ImageMagick versions prior to 7.0.9-0.

In ParseMetaGeometry() of MagickCore/geometry.c, image height and
width calculations can lead to divide-by-zero conditions which also
lead to undefined behavior. This flaw can be triggered by a crafted

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00034.html

User credentials can be manipulated and stolen by Native CephFS
consumers of OpenStack Manila, resulting in potential privilege
escalation. An Open Stack Manila user can request access to a share to
an arbitrary cephx user, including existing users. The access key is
retrieved via the interface drivers. Then, all users of the requesting
OpenStack project can view the access key. This enables the attacker
to target any resource that the user has access to. This can be done
to even "admin" users, compromising the ceph administrator. This flaw
affects Ceph versions prior to 14.2.16, 15.x prior to 15.2.8, and 16.x
prior to 16.2.0.

A Zip Slip vulnerability was found in the oc binary in openshift-
clients where an arbitrary file write is achieved by using a specially
crafted raw container image (.tar file) which contains symbolic links.
The vulnerability is limited to the command `oc image extract`. If a
symbolic link is first created pointing within the tarball, this
allows further symbolic links to bypass the existing path check. This
flaw allows the tarball to create links outside the tarball's parent
directory, allowing for executables or configuration files to be
overwritten, resulting in arbitrary code execution. The highest threat
from this vulnerability is to confidentiality, integrity, as well as
system availability. Versions up to and including openshift-

The SIP ALG implementation on NETGEAR Nighthawk R7000 1.0.9.64_10.2.64
devices allows remote attackers to communicate with arbitrary TCP and
UDP services on a victim's intranet machine, if the victim visits an
attacker-controlled web site with a modern browser, aka NAT
Slipstreaming. This occurs because the ALG takes action based on an IP
packet with an initial REGISTER substring in the TCP data, and the
correct intranet IP address in the subsequent Via header, without
properly considering that connection progress and fragmentation affect

Name: CVE-2020-28044
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://git.lsd.cat/g/pax-pwn

An attacker with physical access to a PAX Point Of Sale device with
ProlinOS through 2.4.161.8859R can boot it in management mode, enable
the XCB service, and then list, read, create, and overwrite files with
MAINAPP permissions.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-28045
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://git.lsd.cat/g/pax-pwn

An unsigned-library issue was discovered in ProlinOS through
2.4.161.8859R. This OS requires installed applications and all system
binaries to be signed either by the manufacturer or by the Point Of
Sale application developer and distributor. The signature is a
2048-byte RSA signature verified in the kernel prior to ELF execution.
Shared libraries, however, do not need to be signed, and they are not
verified. An attacker may execute a custom binary by compiling it as a
shared object and loading it via LD_PRELOAD.

Name: CVE-2020-28046
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://git.lsd.cat/g/pax-pwn

An issue was discovered in ProlinOS through 2.4.161.8859R. An attacker
with local code execution privileges as a normal user (MAINAPP) can
escalate to root privileges by exploiting the setuid installation of
the xtables-multi binary and leveraging the ip6tables --modprobe
switch.

AudimexEE before 14.1.1 is vulnerable to Reflected XSS (Cross-Site-
Scripting). If the recommended security configuration parameter
"unique_error_numbers" is not set, remote attackers can inject
arbitrary web script or HTML via 'action, cargo, panel' parameters
that can lead to data leakage.

An issue was discovered in SDDM before 0.19.0. It incorrectly starts
the X server in a way that - for a short time period - allows local
unprivileged users to create a connection to the X server without
providing proper authentication. A local attacker can thus access X
server display contents and, for example, intercept keystrokes or
access the clipboard. This is caused by a race condition during
Xauthority file creation.

pass through 1.7.3 has a possibility of using a password for an
unintended resource. For exploitation to occur, the user must do a git
pull, decrypt a password, and log into a remote service with the
password. If an attacker controls the central Git server or one of the
other members' machines, and also controls one of the services already
in the password store, they can rename one of the password files in
the Git repository to something else: pass doesn't correctly verify
that the content of a file matches the filename, so a user might be
tricked into decrypting the wrong password and sending that to a
service that the attacker controls. NOTE: for environments in which
this threat model is of concern, signing commits can be a solution.

Reference: MISC:https://issues.asterisk.org/jira/browse/ASTERISK-29057

A res_pjsip_session crash was discovered in Asterisk Open Source 13.x
before 13.37.1, 16.x before 16.14.1, 17.x before 17.8.1, and 18.x
before 18.0.1. and Certified Asterisk before 16.8-cert5. Upon
receiving a new SIP Invite, Asterisk did not return the created dialog
locked or referenced. This caused a gap between the creation of the
dialog object, and its next use by the thread that created it.
Depending on some off-nominal circumstances and timing, it was
possible for another thread to free said dialog in this gap. Asterisk
could then crash when the dialog object, or any of its dependent
objects, were dereferenced or accessed next by the initial-creation
thread. Note, however, that this crash can only occur when using a
connection-oriented protocol (e.g., TCP or TLS, but not UDP) for SIP
transport. Also, the remote client must be authenticated, or Asterisk
must be configured for anonymous calling.

Vulnerability in the Oracle Quoting product of Oracle E-Business Suite
(component: Courseware). Supported versions that are affected are
12.1.1-12.1.3. Easily exploitable vulnerability allows unauthenticated
attacker with network access via HTTP to compromise Oracle Quoting.
Successful attacks require human interaction from a person other than
the attacker and while the vulnerability is in Oracle Quoting, attacks
may significantly impact additional products. Successful attacks of
this vulnerability can result in unauthorized access to critical data
or complete access to all Oracle Quoting accessible data as well as
unauthorized update, insert or delete access to some of Oracle Quoting
accessible data. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 8.2 (Confidentiality and

Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W devices have Improper Access Control.
Affected Version(s): 2.5.1.8. The Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W device
has an SSH daemon included in the firmware image. By default, the SSH
daemon is disabled and does not start at system boot. The system
initialization scripts read a device configuration file variable to
see if the SSH daemon should be started. The web interface does not
provide a visible capability to alter this configuration file
variable. However, a malicious actor can include this variable in a
POST such that the SSH daemon will be started when the device boots.

Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W devices allow Authentication Bypass.
Affected Version(s): 2.5.1.8. The Barco wePresent WiPG-1600W web
interface does not use session cookies for tracking authenticated
sessions. Instead, the web interface uses a "SEID" token that is
appended to the end of URLs in GET requests. Thus the "SEID" would be
exposed in web proxy logs and browser history. An attacker that is
able to capture the "SEID" and originate requests from the same IP
address (via a NAT device or web proxy) would be able to access the
user interface of the device without having to know the credentials.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/13/5

In drivers/target/target_core_xcopy.c in the Linux kernel before
5.10.7, insufficient identifier checking in the LIO SCSI target code
can be used by remote attackers to read or write files via directory
traversal in an XCOPY request, aka CID-2896c93811e3. For example, an
attack can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one
iSCSI LUN. The attacker gains control over file access because I/O
operations are proxied via an attacker-selected backstore.

configs that represent a service export/import cycles. Disclaimer from
the maintainers: Running a NATS service which is exposed to untrusted
users presents a heightened risk. Any remote execution flaw or
equivalent seriousness, or denial-of-service by unauthenticated users,
will lead to prompt releases by the NATS maintainers. Fixes for denial
of service issues with no threat of remote execution, when limited to
account holders, are likely to just be committed to the main
development branch with no special attention. Those who are running
such services are encouraged to build regularly from git.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/01/msg00019.html

The package bottle from 0 and before 0.12.19 are vulnerable to Web
Cache Poisoning by using a vector called parameter cloaking. When the
attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;), they can
cause a difference in the interpretation of the request between the
proxy (running with default configuration) and the server. This can
result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe ones, as
the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator, and
therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed parameter.

With MariaDB running on Windows, when local clients connect to the
server over named pipes, it's possible for an unprivileged user with
an ability to run code on the server machine to intercept the named
pipe connection and act as a man-in-the-middle, gaining access to all
the data passed between the client and the server, and getting the
ability to run SQL commands on behalf of the connected user. This
occurs because of an incorrect security descriptor. This affects
MariaDB Server before 10.1.48, 10.2.x before 10.2.35, 10.3.x before
10.3.26, 10.4.x before 10.4.16, and 10.5.x before 10.5.7. NOTE: this
issue exists because certain details of the MariaDB CVE-2019-2503 fix
did not comprehensively address attack variants against MariaDB. This
situation is specific to MariaDB, and thus CVE-2020-28912 does NOT
apply to other vendors that were originally affected by CVE-2019-2503.

An improper file permissions vulnerability affects Kata Containers
prior to 1.11.5. When using a Kubernetes hostPath volume and mounting
either a file or directory into a container as readonly, the
file/directory is mounted as readOnly inside the container, but is
still writable inside the guest. For a container breakout situation, a
malicious guest can potentially modify or delete files/directories
expected to be read-only.

An issue was discovered in Rclone before 1.53.3. Due to the use of a
weak random number generator, the password generator has been
producing weak passwords with much less entropy than advertised. The
suggested passwords depend deterministically on the time the second
rclone was started. This limits the entropy of the passwords
enormously. These passwords are often used in the crypt backend for
encryption of data. It would be possible to make a dictionary of all
possible passwords with about 38 million entries per password length.
This would make decryption of secret material possible with a
plausible amount of effort. NOTE: all passwords generated by affected
versions should be changed.

NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.12.0, and NLnet Labs
NSD, up to and including version 4.3.3, contain a local vulnerability
that would allow for a local symlink attack. When writing the PID
file, Unbound and NSD create the file if it is not there, or open an
existing file for writing. In case the file was already present, they
would follow symlinks if the file happened to be a symlink instead of
a regular file. An additional chown of the file would then take place
after it was written, making the user Unbound/NSD is supposed to run
as the new owner of the file. If an attacker has local access to the
user Unbound/NSD runs as, she could create a symlink in place of the
PID file pointing to a file that she would like to erase. If then
Unbound/NSD is killed and the PID file is not cleared, upon restarting
with root privileges, Unbound/NSD will rewrite any file pointed at by
the symlink. This is a local vulnerability that could create a Denial
of Service of the system Unbound/NSD is running on. It requires an
attacker having access to the limited permission user Unbound/NSD runs
as and point through the symlink to a critical file on the system.

EJBCA's domain security model, the peer connector allows the
restriction of client certificates (for the RA, not the end user) to a
limited set of allowed CAs, thus restricting the accessibility of that
RA to the rights it has within a specific role. While this works for
other protocols such as CMP, it was found that the EJBCA enrollment
over an EST implementation bypasses this check, allowing enrollment
with a valid client certificate through any functioning and
authenticated RA connected to the CA. NOTE: an attacker must already
have a trusted client certificate and authorization to enroll against
the targeted CA.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20201124 Re: Linux kernel slab-out-of-bounds Read in fbcon
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/11/25/1

A slab-out-of-bounds read in fbcon in the Linux kernel before 5.9.7
could be used by local attackers to read privileged information or
potentially crash the kernel, aka CID-3c4e0dff2095. This occurs
because KD_FONT_OP_COPY in drivers/tty/vt/vt.c can be used for
manipulations such as font height.

** DISPUTED ** svm_predict_values in svm.cpp in Libsvm v324, as used
in scikit-learn 0.23.2 and other products, allows attackers to cause a
denial of service (segmentation fault) via a crafted model SVM
(introduced via pickle, json, or any other model permanence standard)
with a large value in the _n_support array. NOTE: the scikit-learn
vendor's position is that the behavior can only occur if the library's
API is violated by an application that changes a private attribute.
