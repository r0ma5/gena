GNOME gdk-pixbuf (aka GdkPixbuf) before 2.42.2 allows a denial of
service (infinite loop) in lzw.c in the function write_indexes. if
c->self_code equals 10, self->code_table[10].extends will assign the
value 11 to c. The next execution in the loop will assign
self->code_table[11].extends to c, which will give the value of 10.
This will make the loop run infinitely. This bug can, for example, be
triggered by calling this function with a GIF image with LZW
compression that is crafted in a special way.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. In the Ocaml xenstored
implementation, the internal representation of the tree has special
cases for the root node, because this node has no parent.
Unfortunately, permissions were not checked for certain operations on
the root node. Unprivileged guests can get and modify permissions,
list, and delete the root node. (Deleting the whole xenstore tree is a
host-wide denial of service.) Achieving xenstore write access is also
possible. All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and
using oxenstored is the default in the upstream Xen distribution, if
the Ocaml compiler is available. Systems using C xenstored are not
vulnerable.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Neither xenstore
implementation does any permission checks when reporting a xenstore
watch event. A guest administrator can watch the root xenstored node,
which will cause notifications for every created, modified, and
deleted key. A guest administrator can also use the special watches,
which will cause a notification every time a domain is created and
destroyed. Data may include: number, type, and domids of other VMs;
existence and domids of driver domains; numbers of virtual interfaces,
block devices, vcpus; existence of virtual framebuffers and their
backend style (e.g., existence of VNC service); Xen VM UUIDs for other
domains; timing information about domain creation and device setup;
and some hints at the backend provisioning of VMs and their devices.
The watch events do not contain values stored in xenstore, only key
names. A guest administrator can observe non-sensitive domain and
device lifecycle events relating to other guests. This information
allows some insight into overall system configuration (including the
number and general nature of other guests), and configuration of other
guests (including the number and general nature of other guests'
devices). This information might be commercially interesting or might
make other attacks easier. There is not believed to be exposure of
sensitive data. Specifically, there is no exposure of VNC passwords,
port numbers, pathnames in host and guest filesystems, cryptographic
keys, or within-guest data.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/12/16/3

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Access rights of
Xenstore nodes are per domid. Unfortunately, existing granted access
rights are not removed when a domain is being destroyed. This means
that a new domain created with the same domid will inherit the access
rights to Xenstore nodes from the previous domain(s) with the same
domid. Because all Xenstore entries of a guest below
/local/domain/<domid> are being deleted by Xen tools when a guest is
destroyed, only Xenstore entries of other guests still running are
affected. For example, a newly created guest domain might be able to
read sensitive information that had belonged to a previously existing
guest domain. Both Xenstore implementations (C and Ocaml) are
vulnerable.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A guest may access
xenstore paths via absolute paths containing a full pathname, or via a
relative path, which implicitly includes /local/domain/$DOMID for
their own domain id. Management tools must access paths in guests'
namespaces, necessarily using absolute paths. oxenstored imposes a
pathname limit that is applied solely to the relative or absolute path
specified by the client. Therefore, a guest can create paths in its
own namespace which are too long for management tools to access.
Depending on the toolstack in use, a malicious guest administrator
might cause some management tools and debugging operations to fail.
For example, a guest administrator can cause "xenstore-ls -r" to fail.
However, a guest administrator cannot prevent the host administrator
from tearing down the domain. All systems using oxenstored are
vulnerable. Building and using oxenstored is the default in the
upstream Xen distribution, if the Ocaml compiler is available. Systems
using C xenstored are not vulnerable.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Xenstored and guests
communicate via a shared memory page using a specific protocol. When a
guest violates this protocol, xenstored will drop the connection to
that guest. Unfortunately, this is done by just removing the guest
from xenstored's internal management, resulting in the same actions as
if the guest had been destroyed, including sending an @releaseDomain
event. @releaseDomain events do not say that the guest has been
removed. All watchers of this event must look at the states of all
guests to find the guest that has been removed. When an @releaseDomain
is generated due to a domain xenstored protocol violation, because the
guest is still running, the watchers will not react. Later, when the
guest is actually destroyed, xenstored will no longer have it stored
in its internal data base, so no further @releaseDomain event will be
sent. This can lead to a zombie domain; memory mappings of that
guest's memory will not be removed, due to the missing event. This
zombie domain will be cleaned up only after another domain is
destroyed, as that will trigger another @releaseDomain event. If the
device model of the guest that violated the Xenstore protocol is
running in a stub-domain, a use-after-free case could happen in
xenstored, after having removed the guest from its internal data base,
possibly resulting in a crash of xenstored. A malicious guest can
block resources of the host for a period after its own death. Guests
with a stub domain device model can eventually crash xenstored,
resulting in a more serious denial of service (the prevention of any
further domain management operations). Only the C variant of Xenstore
is affected; the Ocaml variant is not affected. Only HVM guests with a
stubdom device model can cause a serious DoS.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When a Xenstore watch
fires, the xenstore client that registered the watch will receive a
Xenstore message containing the path of the modified Xenstore entry
that triggered the watch, and the tag that was specified when
registering the watch. Any communication with xenstored is done via
Xenstore messages, consisting of a message header and the payload. The
payload length is limited to 4096 bytes. Any request to xenstored
resulting in a response with a payload longer than 4096 bytes will
result in an error. When registering a watch, the payload length limit
applies to the combined length of the watched path and the specified
tag. Because watches for a specific path are also triggered for all
nodes below that path, the payload of a watch event message can be
longer than the payload needed to register the watch. A malicious
guest that registers a watch using a very large tag (i.e., with a
registration operation payload length close to the 4096 byte limit)
can cause the generation of watch events with a payload length larger
than 4096 bytes, by writing to Xenstore entries below the watched
path. This will result in an error condition in xenstored. This error
can result in a NULL pointer dereference, leading to a crash of
xenstored. A malicious guest administrator can cause xenstored to
crash, leading to a denial of service. Following a xenstored crash,
domains may continue to run, but management operations will be
impossible. Only C xenstored is affected, oxenstored is not affected.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Nodes in xenstore have
an ownership. In oxenstored, a owner could give a node away. However,
node ownership has quota implications. Any guest can run another guest
out of quota, or create an unbounded number of nodes owned by dom0,
thus running xenstored out of memory A malicious guest administrator
can cause a denial of service against a specific guest or against the
whole host. All systems using oxenstored are vulnerable. Building and

An issue was discovered in Xen XAPI before 2020-12-15. Certain
xenstore keys provide feedback from the guest, and are therefore
watched by toolstack. Specifically, keys are watched by xenopsd, and
data are forwarded via RPC through message-switch to xapi. The
watching logic in xenopsd sends one RPC update containing all data,
any time any single xenstore key is updated, and therefore has O(N^2)
time complexity. Furthermore, message-switch retains recent (currently
128) RPC messages for diagnostic purposes, yielding O(M*N) space
complexity. The quantity of memory a single guest can monopolise is
bounded by xenstored quota, but the quota is fairly large. It is
believed to be in excess of 1G per malicious guest. In practice, this
manifests as a host denial of service, either through message-switch
thrashing against swap, or OOMing entirely, depending on dom0's
configuration. (There are no quotas in xenopsd to limit the quantity
of keys that result in RPC traffic.) A buggy or malicious guest can
cause unreasonable memory usage in dom0, resulting in a host denial of
service. All versions of XAPI are vulnerable. Systems that are not
using the XAPI toolstack are not vulnerable.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. When they require
assistance from the device model, x86 HVM guests must be temporarily
de-scheduled. The device model will signal Xen when it has completed
its operation, via an event channel, so that the relevant vCPU is
rescheduled. If the device model were to signal Xen without having
actually completed the operation, the de-schedule / re-schedule cycle
would repeat. If, in addition, Xen is resignalled very quickly, the
re-schedule may occur before the de-schedule was fully complete,
triggering a shortcut. This potentially repeating process uses
ordinary recursive function calls, and thus could result in a stack
overflow. A malicious or buggy stubdomain serving a HVM guest can
cause Xen to crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the
entire host. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not
affected. Only x86 stubdomains serving HVM guests can exploit the
vulnerability.

An issue was discovered in Xen 4.14.x. When moving IRQs between CPUs
to distribute the load of IRQ handling, IRQ vectors are dynamically
allocated and de-allocated on the relevant CPUs. De-allocation has to
happen when certain constraints are met. If these conditions are not
met when first checked, the checking CPU may send an interrupt to
itself, in the expectation that this IRQ will be delivered only after
the condition preventing the cleanup has cleared. For two specific IRQ
vectors, this expectation was violated, resulting in a continuous
stream of self-interrupts, which renders the CPU effectively unusable.
A domain with a passed through PCI device can cause lockup of a
physical CPU, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) to the entire
host. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable.
Only guests with physical PCI devices passed through to them can
exploit the vulnerability.

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.10.1, as used
with Xen through 4.14.x. The Linux kernel PV block backend expects the
kernel thread handler to reset ring->xenblkd to NULL when stopped.
However, the handler may not have time to run if the frontend quickly
toggles between the states connect and disconnect. As a consequence,
the block backend may re-use a pointer after it was freed. A
misbehaving guest can trigger a dom0 crash by continuously connecting
/ disconnecting a block frontend. Privilege escalation and information
leaks cannot be ruled out. This only affects systems with a Linux
blkback.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. A bounds check common
to most operation time functions specific to FIFO event channels
depends on the CPU observing consistent state. While the producer side
uses appropriately ordered writes, the consumer side isn't protected
against re-ordered reads, and may hence end up de-referencing a NULL
pointer. Malicious or buggy guest kernels can mount a Denial of

be vulnerable. Whether a system is vulnerable depends on the specific

Status: Candidate
Reference: CISCO:20200205 Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras Cisco Discovery Protocol Remote Code Execution and Denial of Service Vulnerability
Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200205-ipcameras-rce-dos
Reference: MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156203/Cisco-Discovery-Protocol-CDP-Remote-Device-Takeover.html

A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for the
Cisco Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras could allow an
unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute code remotely or cause a
reload of an affected IP Camera. The vulnerability is due to missing
checks when processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco
Discovery Protocol packet to the targeted IP Camera. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to expose the affected IP Camera for
remote code execution or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in
a denial of service (DoS) condition. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a
Layer 2 protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be
in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2
adjacent). This vulnerability is fixed in Video Surveillance 8000
Series IP Camera Firmware Release 1.0.7 and later.

Reference: MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/156203/Cisco-Discovery-Protocol-CDP-Remote-Device-Takeover.html

A vulnerability in the Cisco Discovery Protocol implementation for the
Cisco IP Phone could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to
remotely execute code with root privileges or cause a reload of an
affected IP phone. The vulnerability is due to missing checks when
processing Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted Cisco Discovery
Protocol packet to the targeted IP phone. A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to remotely execute code with root privileges or
cause a reload of an affected IP phone, resulting in a denial of
service (DoS) condition. Cisco Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2
protocol. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be in the
same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200219-dcnm-priv-esc

A vulnerability in the REST API endpoint of Cisco Data Center Network
Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
elevate privileges on the application. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient access control validation. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by authenticating with a low-privilege account and
sending a crafted request to the API. A successful exploit could allow
the attacker to interact with the API with administrative privileges.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-20200219-dcnm-xss

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Data
Center Network Manager (DCNM) could allow an authenticated, remote
attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user
of the web-based management interface. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based
management interface. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
script code in the context of the interface or access sensitive,
browser-based information.

Name: CVE-2020-3442
Status: Candidate
Reference: CISCO:DuoConnect SSH Connection Vulnerability
Reference: URL:https://duo.com/labs/psa/duo-psa-2020-003

The DuoConnect client enables users to establish SSH connections to
hosts protected by a DNG instance. When a user initiates an SSH
connection to a DNG-protected host for the first time using
DuoConnect, the user&#8217;s browser is opened to a login screen in order to
complete authentication determined by the contents of the '-relay'
argument. If the &#8216;-relay&#8217; is set to a URL beginning with "http://",
then the browser will initially attempt to load the URL over an
insecure HTTP connection, before being immediately redirected to HTTPS
(in addition to standard redirect mechanisms, the DNG uses HTTP Strict
Transport Security headers to enforce this). After successfully
authenticating to a DNG, DuoConnect stores an authentication token in
a local system cache, so users do not have to complete this browser-
based authentication workflow for every subsequent SSH connection.
These tokens are valid for a configurable period of time, which
defaults to 8 hours. If a user running DuoConnect already has a valid
token, then instead of opening a web browser, DuoConnect directly
contacts the DNG, again using the configured '-relay' value, and sends
this token, as well as the intended SSH server hostname and port
numbers. If the '-relay' argument begins with "http://", then this
request will be sent over an insecure connection, and could be exposed
to an attacker who is sniffing the traffic on the same network. The
DNG authentication tokens that may be exposed during SSH relay may be
used to gain network-level access to the servers and ports protected
by that given relay host. The DNG provides network-level access only
to the protected SSH servers. It does not interact with the
independent SSH authentication and encryption. An attacker cannot use
a stolen token on its own to authenticate against a DNG-protected SSH
server.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftd-container-esc-FmYqFBQV

A vulnerability in the multi-instance feature of Cisco Firepower
Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, local
attacker to escape the container for their Cisco FTD instance and
execute commands with root privileges in the host namespace. The
attacker must have valid credentials on the device.The vulnerability
exists because a configuration file that is used at container startup
has insufficient protections. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by modifying a specific container configuration file on
the underlying file system. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to execute commands with root privileges within the host
namespace. This could allow the attacker to impact other running Cisco
FTD instances or the host Cisco FXOS device.

A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) input
packet processor of Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software
could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected
device to restart unexpectedly. The vulnerability is due to a lack of
sufficient memory management protections under heavy SNMP polling
loads. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a high
rate of SNMP requests to the SNMP daemon through the management
interface on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to cause the SNMP daemon process to consume a large amount of
system memory over time, which could then lead to an unexpected device
restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. This
vulnerability affects all versions of SNMP.

Reference: CISCO:20200902 Cisco FXOS Software Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-fxos-buffer-cSdmfWUt

A vulnerability in Cisco FXOS Software could allow an authenticated,
local attacker with administrative credentials to cause a buffer
overflow condition. The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds
checking of values that are parsed from a specific file. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by supplying a crafted file that,
when it is processed, may cause a stack-based buffer overflow. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code
on the underlying operating system with root privileges. An attacker
would need to have valid administrative credentials to exploit this
vulnerability.

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco AsyncOS
software for Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA) could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an
affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation
of requests that are sent to the web-based management interface. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request
to the interface of an affected device. A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to obtain the IP addresses that are configured on
the internal interfaces of the affected device. There is a workaround
that addresses this vulnerability.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ftdfmc-sft-mitm-tc8AzFs2

A vulnerability in the sftunnel functionality of Cisco Firepower
Management Center (FMC) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
(FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
obtain the device registration hash. The vulnerability is due to
insufficient sftunnel negotiation protection during initial device
registration. An attacker in a man-in-the-middle position could
exploit this vulnerability by intercepting a specific flow of the
sftunnel communication between an FMC device and an FTD device. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to decrypt and modify the
sftunnel communication between FMC and FTD devices, allowing the
attacker to modify configuration data sent from an FMC device to an
FTD device or alert data sent from an FTD device to an FMC device.

of the interface of an affected device. The vulnerability exists
because the web-based management interface does not properly validate
user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
persuading a user of an affected interface to click a crafted link. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary
script code in the context of the affected interface or access
sensitive, browser-based information.

A flaw was found in jboss-remoting in versions before
5.0.20.SP1-redhat-00001. A malicious attacker could cause threads to
hold up forever in the EJB server by writing a sequence of bytes
corresponding to the expected messages of a successful EJB client
request, but omitting the ACK messages, or just tamper with jboss-
remoting code, deleting the lines that send the ACK message from the
EJB client code resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat
from this vulnerability is to system availability.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-anyconnect-ipc-KfQO9QhK

A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of
Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software could allow an
authenticated, local attacker to cause a targeted AnyConnect user to
execute a malicious script. The vulnerability is due to a lack of
authentication to the IPC listener. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted IPC messages to the AnyConnect client
IPC listener. A successful exploit could allow an attacker to cause
the targeted AnyConnect user to execute a script. This script would
execute with the privileges of the targeted AnyConnect user. In order
to successfully exploit this vulnerability, there must be an ongoing
AnyConnect session by the targeted user at the time of the attack. To
exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would also need valid user
credentials on the system upon which the AnyConnect client is being
run. Cisco has not released software updates that address this
vulnerability.

The limit-login-attempts-reloaded plugin before 2.17.4 for WordPress
allows wp-admin/options-general.php?page=limit-login-attempts&tab=
XSS. A malicious user can cause an administrator user to supply
dangerous content to the vulnerable page, which is then reflected back
to the user and executed by the web browser. The most common mechanism
for delivering malicious content is to include it as a parameter in a
URL that is posted publicly or e-mailed directly to victims.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-aironet-dos-h3DCuLXw

A vulnerability in Cisco Aironet Access Point (AP) Software could
allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause an affected device
to reload. The vulnerability is due to improper handling of clients
that are trying to connect to the AP. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending authentication requests from multiple clients
to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker
to cause the affected device to reload.

LimitLoginAttempts.php in the limit-login-attempts-reloaded plugin
before 2.17.4 for WordPress allows a bypass of (per IP address) rate
limits because the X-Forwarded-For header can be forged. When the
plugin is configured to accept an arbitrary header for the client
source IP address, a malicious user is not limited to perform a brute
force attack, because the client IP header accepts any arbitrary
string. When randomizing the header input, the login count does not
ever reach the maximum allowed retries.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-tcp-intercept-bypass-xG9M3PbY

A vulnerability in the TCP Intercept functionality of Cisco Firepower
Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to bypass configured Access Control Policies (including
Geolocation) and Service Polices on an affected system. The
vulnerability exists because TCP Intercept is invoked when the
embryonic connection limit is reached, which can cause the underlying
detection engine to process the packet incorrectly. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted stream of traffic that
matches a policy on which TCP Intercept is configured. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to match on an incorrect policy,
which could allow the traffic to be forwarded when it should be
dropped. In addition, the traffic could incorrectly be dropped.

of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is
due to insufficient validation of requests sent to the REST API. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request
to the REST API. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
cause a permanent DoS condition that is due to high CPU utilization.
Manual intervention may be required to recover the Cisco IND.

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://labs.ingredous.com/2020/07/13/ois-sqli/

BigProf Online Invoicing System before 2.9 suffers from an
unauthenticated SQL Injection found in /membership_passwordReset.php
(the endpoint that is responsible for issuing self-service password
resets). An unauthenticated attacker is able to send a request
containing a crafted payload that can result in sensitive information
being extracted from the database, eventually leading into an
application takeover. This vulnerability was introduced as a result of
the developer trying to roll their own sanitization implementation in
order to allow the application to be used in legacy environments.

BigProf Online Invoicing System before 3.0 offers a functionality that

The applicable endpoint (admin/pageTransferOwnership.php) lacks CSRF
protection, resulting in an attacker being able to escalate their

BigProf Online Invoicing System before 3.1 fails to correctly sanitize
an XSS payload when a user registers using the self-registration
functionality. As such, an attacker can input a crafted payload that
will execute upon the application's administrator browsing the
registered users' list. Once the arbitrary Javascript is executed in
the context of the admin, this will cause the attacker to gain
administrative privileges, effectively leading into an application
takeover. This affects app/membership_signup.php and
app/admin/pageViewMembers.php.

BigProf Online Invoicing System before 4.0 fails to adequately
sanitize fields for HTML characters upon an administrator using
admin/pageEditGroup.php to create a new group, resulting in Stored
XSS. The caveat here is that an attacker would need administrative
privileges in order to create the payload. One might think this
completely mitigates the privilege-escalation impact as there is only
one high-privileged role. However, it was discovered that the endpoint
responsible for creating the group lacks CSRF protection.

crafted IGMP traffic to an affected device. A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to immediately crash the IGMP process or cause
memory exhaustion, resulting in other processes becoming unstable.

A vulnerability in the SSL/TLS session handler of Cisco Adaptive
Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense
(FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The
vulnerability is due to a memory leak when closing SSL/TLS connections
in a specific state. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
establishing several SSL/TLS sessions and ensuring they are closed
under certain conditions. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to exhaust memory resources in the affected device, which
would prevent it from processing new SSL/TLS connections, resulting in
a DoS. Manual intervention is required to recover an affected device.

Webex Recording Format (WRF). An attacker could exploit these
vulnerabilities by sending a user a malicious ARF or WRF file through
a link or email attachment and persuading the user to open the file
with the affected software on the local system. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected
system with the privileges of the targeted user.

A vulnerability in the ingress packet processing path of Cisco
Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software for interfaces that are
configured either as Inline Pair or in Passive mode could allow an
unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS)
condition. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation when
Ethernet frames are processed. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending malicious Ethernet frames through an affected
device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker do either of the
following: Fill the /ngfw partition on the device: A full /ngfw
partition could result in administrators being unable to log in to the
device (including logging in through the console port) or the device
being unable to boot up correctly. Note: Manual intervention is
required to recover from this situation. Customers are advised to
contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) to help recover a
device in this condition. Cause a process crash: The process crash
would cause the device to reload. No manual intervention is necessary
to recover the device after the reload.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-xss-multiple-FCB3vPZe

Multiple vulnerabilities in the web services interface of Cisco
Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat
Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the
web services interface of an affected device. The vulnerabilities are
due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web
services interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit
these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a
crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the
attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information. Note: These
vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN
configurations. For more information, see the Vulnerable Products
section.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-xss-multiple-FCB3vPZe

Multiple vulnerabilities in the web services interface of Cisco
Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat
Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the
web services interface of an affected device. The vulnerabilities are
due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web
services interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit
these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a
crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the
attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information. Note: These
vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN
configurations. For more information, see the Vulnerable Products
section.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-xss-multiple-FCB3vPZe

Multiple vulnerabilities in the web services interface of Cisco
Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat
Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against a user of the
web services interface of an affected device. The vulnerabilities are
due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web
services interface of an affected device. An attacker could exploit
these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a
crafted link. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the interface or allow the
attacker to access sensitive, browser-based information. Note: These
vulnerabilities affect only specific AnyConnect and WebVPN
configurations. For more information, see the Vulnerable Products
section.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-tls-bb-2g9uWkP

A vulnerability in the TLS handler of Cisco Adaptive Security
Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD)
Software for Cisco Firepower 1000 Series firewalls could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to gain access to sensitive
information. The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of
countermeasures against the Bleichenbacher attack for cipher suites
that rely on RSA for key exchange. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted TLS messages to the device, which
would act as an oracle and allow the attacker to carry out a chosen-
ciphertext attack. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
perform cryptanalytic operations that may allow decryption of
previously captured TLS sessions to the affected device. To exploit
this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to perform both of the
following actions: Capture TLS traffic that is in transit between
clients and the affected device Actively establish a considerable
number of TLS connections to the affected device

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN
vManage Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to
bypass authorization and modify the configuration of an affected
system. The vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization
checking on an affected system. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based
management interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could
allow the attacker to gain privileges beyond what would normally be
authorized for their configured user authorization level. This could
allow the attacker to modify the configuration of an affected system.

Pax Technology PAXSTORE v7.0.8_20200511171508 and lower is affected by
an information disclosure vulnerability. Through the PUK signature
functionality, an administrator will not have access to the current
p12 certificate and password. When accessing this functionality, the
administrator has the option to replace the current certificate and it
is not possible to view the certificate password (p12) already
deployed on the platform. The replacement p12 certificate returns to
users in base64 with its password, which can be accessed by non-
administrator users.

Pax Technology PAXSTORE v7.0.8_20200511171508 and lower is affected by
a token spoofing vulnerability. Each payment terminal has a session
token (called X-Terminal-Token) to access the marketplace. This allows
the store to identify the terminal and make available the applications
distributed by its reseller. By intercepting HTTPS traffic from the
application store, it is possible to collect the request responsible
for assigning the X-Terminal-Token to the terminal, which makes it
possible to craft an X-Terminal-Token pretending to be another device.
An attacker can use this behavior to authenticate its own payment
terminal in the application store through token impersonation.

An issue was discovered in Veritas System Recovery before 21.2. On
start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library from \usr\local\ssl. This
library attempts to load the from \usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf
configuration file, which does not exist. By default, on Windows
systems, users can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user
can create a C:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a
malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution as
SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator
access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all
data and installed applications, etc. If the system is also an Active
Directory domain controller, then this can affect the entire domain.

Reference: MISC:https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-009

An issue was discovered in Veritas APTARE 10.4 before 10.4P9 and 10.5
before 10.5P3. By default, on Windows systems, users can create
directories under C:\. A low privileged user can create a directory at
the configuration file locations. When the Windows system restarts, a
malicious OpenSSL engine could exploit arbitrary code execution as
SYSTEM. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system,
allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all
installed applications, etc.

Name: CVE-2020-36162
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-011

An issue was discovered in Veritas CloudPoint before 8.3.0.1+hotfix.
The CloudPoint Windows Agent leverages OpenSSL. This OpenSSL library
attempts to load the \usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file,
which does not exist. By default, on Windows systems users can create
directories under <drive>:\. A low privileged user can create a
<drive>:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a
malicious OpenSSL engine, which may result in arbitrary code
execution. This would give the attacker administrator access on the
system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access
all installed applications, etc.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-36163
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-016#Issue2

An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup and OpsCenter through
8.3.0.1. NetBackup processes using Strawberry Perl attempt to load and
execute libraries from paths that do not exist by default on the
Windows operating system. By default, on Windows systems, users can
create directories under C:\. If a low privileged user on the Windows
system creates an affected path with a library that NetBackup attempts
to load, they can execute arbitrary code as SYSTEM or Administrator.
This gives the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing
the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all installed
applications, etc. This affects NetBackup master servers, media
servers, clients, and OpsCenter servers on the Windows platform. The
system is vulnerable during an install or upgrade on all systems and
post-install on Master, Media, and OpsCenter servers during normal
operations.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-36164
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-013

An issue was discovered in Veritas Enterprise Vault through 14.0. On
start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library. The OpenSSL library then
attempts to load the openssl.cnf configuration file (which does not
exist) at the following locations in both the System drive (typically
C:\) and the product's installation drive (typically not C:\):
\Isode\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf (on SMTP Server) or \user\ssl\openssl.cnf
(on other affected components). By default, on Windows systems, users
can create directories under C:\. A low privileged user can create a
openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine,
resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service
starts. This gives the attacker administrator access on the system,
allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data, access all
installed applications, etc. This vulnerability only affects a server
with MTP Server, SMTP Archiving IMAP Server, IMAP Archiving, Vault
Cloud Adapter, NetApp File server, or File System Archiving for NetApp
as File Server.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-36165
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-012

An issue was discovered in Veritas Desktop and Laptop Option (DLO)
before 9.4. On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library from
/ReleaseX64/ssl. This library attempts to load the
/ReleaseX64/ssl/openssl.cnf configuration file, which does not exist.
By default, on Windows systems, users can create directories under
C:\. A low privileged user can create a C:/ReleaseX64/ssl/openssl.cnf
configuration file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in
arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives
the attacker administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker
(by default) to access all data, access all installed applications,
etc. This impacts DLO server and client installations.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-36166
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-014

An issue was discovered in Veritas InfoScale 7.x through 7.4.2 on
Windows, Storage Foundation through 6.1 on Windows, Storage Foundation
HA through 6.1 on Windows, and InfoScale Operations Manager (aka VIOM)
Windows Management Server 7.x through 7.4.2. On start-up, it loads the
OpenSSL library from \usr\local\ssl. This library attempts to load the
\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file, which may not exist. On
Windows systems, this path could translate to
<drive>:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf, where <drive> could be the default
Windows installation drive such as C:\ or the drive where a Veritas
product is installed. By default, on Windows systems, users can create
directories under any top-level directory. A low privileged user can
create a <drive>:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file to load
a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution as
SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator
access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all
data, access all installed applications, etc.

An issue was discovered in the server in Veritas Backup Exec through
16.2, 20.6 before hotfix 298543, and 21.1 before hotfix 657517. On
start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library from the Installation folder.
This library in turn attempts to load the /usr/local/ssl/openssl.cnf
configuration file, which may not exist. On Windows systems, this path
could translate to <drive>:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf. A low
privileged user can create a :\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration
file to load a malicious OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code
execution as SYSTEM when the service starts. This gives the attacker
administrator access on the system, allowing the attacker (by default)
to access all data, access all installed applications, etc. If the
system is also an Active Directory domain controller, then this can
affect the entire domain.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-36168
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-015

An issue was discovered in Veritas Resiliency Platform 3.4 and 3.5. It
leverages OpenSSL on Windows systems when using the Managed Host
addon. On start-up, it loads the OpenSSL library. This library may
attempt to load the openssl.cnf configuration file, which does not
exist. By default, on Windows systems, users can create directories
under C:\. A low privileged user can create a
C:\usr\local\ssl\openssl.cnf configuration file to load a malicious
OpenSSL engine, resulting in arbitrary code execution as SYSTEM when
the service starts. This gives the attacker administrator access on
the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data,
access all installed applications, etc.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-36169
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.veritas.com/content/support/en_US/security/VTS20-016#Issue1

An issue was discovered in Veritas NetBackup through 8.3.0.1 and
OpsCenter through 8.3.0.1. Processes using OpenSSL attempt to load and
execute libraries from paths that do not exist by default on the
Windows operating system. By default, on Windows systems, users can
create directories under the top level of any drive. If a low
privileged user creates an affected path with a library that the
Veritas product attempts to load, they can execute arbitrary code as
SYSTEM or Administrator. This gives the attacker administrator access
on the system, allowing the attacker (by default) to access all data,
access all installed applications, etc. This vulnerability affects
master servers, media servers, clients, and OpsCenter servers on the
Windows platform. The system is vulnerable during an install or
upgrade and post-install during normal operations.

the Ehcache ports to only Data Center instances, fixed versions of
Jira will now require a shared secret in order to allow access to the
Ehcache service. [0] In Jira Data Center, Jira Core Data Center, and

An issue was discovered in Mbed TLS before 2.24.0. The verification of
X.509 certificates when matching the expected common name (the cn
argument of mbedtls_x509_crt_verify) with the actual certificate name
is mishandled: when the subjecAltName extension is present, the
expected name is compared to any name in that extension regardless of
its type. This means that an attacker could impersonate a 4-byte or
16-byte domain by getting a certificate for the corresponding IPv4 or
IPv6 address (this would require the attacker to control that IP
address, though).
