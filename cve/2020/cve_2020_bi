In Apache Spark versions prior to 3.4.0, applications using spark-
submit can specify a 'proxy-user' to run as, limiting privileges. The
application can execute code with the privileges of the submitting
user, however, by providing malicious configuration-related classes on
the classpath. This affects architectures relying on proxy-user, for
example those using Apache Livy to manage submitted applications.
Update to Apache Spark 3.4.0 or later, and ensure that
spark.submit.proxyUser.allowCustomClasspathInClusterMode is set to its
default of "false", and is not overridden by submitted applications.

** DISPUTED ** Insecure folder permissions in the Windows installation
path of Shibboleth Service Provider (SP) before 3.4.1 allow an
unprivileged local attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM via DLL
planting in the service executable's folder. This occurs because the

A vulnerability was found in the libreswan library. This security
issue occurs when an IKEv1 Aggressive Mode packet is received with
only unacceptable crypto algorithms, and the response packet is not
sent with a zero responder SPI. When a subsequent packet is received
where the sender reuses the libreswan responder SPI as its own
initiator SPI, the pluto daemon state machine crashes. No remote code
execution is possible. This CVE exists because of a CVE-2023-30570

The Profile Builder &#8211; User Profile & User Registration Forms plugin
for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized password resets in
versions up to, and including 3.9.0. This is due to the plugin using
native password reset functionality, with insufficient validation on
the password reset function (wppb_front_end_password_recovery). The
function uses the plaintext value of a password reset key instead of a
hashed value which means it can easily be retrieved and subsequently
used. An attacker can leverage CVE-2023-0814, or another vulnerability
like SQL Injection in another plugin or theme installed on the site to
successfully exploit this vulnerability.

Due to a vulnerability in the io_uring subsystem, it is possible to
leak kernel memory information to the user process. timens_install
calls current_is_single_threaded to determine if the current process
is single-threaded, but this call does not consider io_uring's
io_worker threads, thus it is possible to insert a time namespace's
vvar page to process's memory space via a page fault. When this time
namespace is destroyed, the vvar page is also freed, but not removed
from the process' memory, and a next page allocated by the kernel will
be still available from the user-space process and can leak memory
contents via this (read-only) use-after-free vulnerability. We
recommend upgrading past version 5.10.161 or commit
788d0824269bef539fe31a785b1517882eafed93 https://git.kernel.org/pub/sc

Spotipy is a light weight Python library for the Spotify Web API. In
versions prior to 2.22.1, if a malicious URI is passed to the library,
the library can be tricked into performing an operation on a different
API endpoint than intended. The code Spotipy uses to parse URIs and
URLs allows an attacker to insert arbitrary characters into the path
that is used for API requests. Because it is possible to include "..",
an attacker can redirect for example a track lookup via
spotifyApi.track() to an arbitrary API endpoint like playlists, but
this is possible for other endpoints as well. The impact of this
vulnerability depends heavily on what operations a client application
performs when it handles a URI from a user and how it uses the
responses it receives from the API. This issue is patched in version
2.22.1.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
Next-Generation IoT devices. Versions prior to and including 4.8 are
vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write that can occur in the BLE-L2CAP
module. The Bluetooth Low Energy - Logical Link Control and Adaptation
Layer Protocol (BLE-L2CAP) module handles fragmentation of packets up
the configured MTU size. When fragments are reassembled, they are
stored in a packet buffer of a configurable size, but there is no
check to verify that the packet buffer is large enough to hold the
reassembled packet. In Contiki-NG's default configuration, it is
possible that an out-of-bounds write of up to 1152 bytes occurs. The
vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG,
and will be included in release 4.9. The problem can be fixed by
applying the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2254 prior to the
release of version 4.9.

LTI Consumer XBlock implements the consumer side of the LTI
specification enabling integration of third-party LTI provider tools.
Versions 7.0.0 and above, prior to 7.2.2, are vulnerable to Missing
Authorization. Any LTI tool that is integrated with on the Open edX
platform can post a grade back for any LTI XBlock so long as it knows
or can guess the block location for that XBlock. An LTI tool submits
scores to the edX platform for line items. The code that uploads that
score to the LMS grade tables determines which XBlock to upload the
grades for by reading the resource_link_id field of the associated
line item. The LTI tool may submit any value for the resource_link_id
field, allowing a malicious LTI tool to submit scores for any LTI
XBlock on the platform. The impact is a loss of integrity for LTI
XBlock grades. This issue is patched in 7.2.2. No workarounds exist.

OpenSearch is an open source distributed and RESTful search engine.
OpenSearch uses JWTs to store role claims obtained from the Identity
Provider (IdP) when the authentication backend is SAML or OpenID
Connect. There is an issue in how those claims are processed from the
JWTs where the leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed, allowing
users to potentially claim roles they are not assigned to if any role
matches the whitespace-stripped version of the roles they are a member
of. This issue is only present for authenticated users, and it
requires either the existence of roles that match, not considering
leading/trailing whitespace, or the ability for users to create said
matching roles. In addition, the Identity Provider must allow leading
and trailing spaces in role names. OpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7 and
2.0.0-2.4.1 are affected. Users are advised to upgrade to OpenSearch
1.3.8 or 2.5.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

OpenSearch is an open source distributed and RESTful search engine. In
affected versions there is an issue in the implementation of field-
level security (FLS) and field masking where rules written to
explicitly exclude fields are not correctly applied for certain
queries that rely on their auto-generated .keyword fields. This issue
is only present for authenticated users with read access to the
indexes containing the restricted fields. This may expose data which
may otherwise not be accessible to the user. OpenSearch 1.0.0-1.3.7

Pi-hole's Web interface (based off of AdminLTE) provides a central
location to manage your Pi-hole. Versions 4.0 and above, prior to
5.18.3 are vulnerable to Insufficient Session Expiration. Improper use
of admin WEBPASSWORD hash as "Remember me for 7 days" cookie value
makes it possible for an attacker to "pass the hash" to login or reuse
a theoretically expired "remember me" cookie. It also exposes the hash
over the network and stores it unnecessarily in the browser. The
cookie itself is set to expire after 7 days but its value will remain
valid as long as the admin password doesn't change. If a cookie is
leaked or compromised it could be used forever as long as the admin
password is not changed. An attacker that obtained the password hash
via an other attack vector (for example a path traversal
vulnerability) could use it to login as the admin by setting the hash
as the cookie value without the need to crack it to obtain the admin
password (pass the hash). The hash is exposed over the network and in
the browser where the cookie is transmitted and stored. This issue is
patched in version 5.18.3.

Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version
3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and 3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-
passed` branches, when submitting a membership request, there is no
character limit for the reason provided with the request. This could
potentially allow a user to flood the database with a large amount of
data. However it is unlikely this could be used as part of a DoS
attack, as the paths reading back the reasons are only available to
administrators. Starting in version 3.0.1 on the `stable` branch and
3.1.0.beta2 on the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a limit of 280
characters has been introduced for membership requests.

Modelina is a library for generating data models based on inputs such
as AsyncAPI, OpenAPI, or JSON Schema documents. Versions prior to
1.0.0 are vulnerable to Code injection. This issue affects anyone who
is using the default presets and/or does not handle the functionality
themself. This issue has been partially mitigated in version 1.0.0,
with the maintainer's GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) noting "It is
impossible to fully guard against this, because users have access to
the original raw information. However, as of version 1, if you only
access the constrained models, you will not encounter this issue.
Further similar situations are NOT seen as a security issue, but
intended behavior." The suggested workaround from the maintainers is
"Fully custom presets that change the entire rendering process which
can then escape the user input."

Discourse is an open-source discussion platform. Prior to version
3.0.1 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 of the `beta` and
`tests-passed` branches, the count of topics displayed for a tag is a

read restricted category or not. As a result, any users can
technically poll a sensitive tag to determine if a new topic is
created in a category which the user does not have excess to. In
version 3.0.1 of the `stable` branch and version 3.1.0.beta2 of the
`beta` and `tests-passed` branches, the count of topics displayed for
a tag defaults to only counting regular topics which are not in read
restricted categories. Staff users will continue to see a count of all
topics regardless of the topic's category read restrictions.

Electron is a framework which lets you write cross-platform desktop
applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A Content-Security-Policy
that disables eval, specifically setting a `script-src` directive and
_not_ providing `unsafe-eval` in that directive, is not respected in
renderers that have sandbox disabled. i.e. `sandbox: false` in the
`webPreferences` object. This allows usage of methods like `eval()`
and `new Function` unexpectedly which can result in an expanded attack
surface. This issue only ever affected the 22 and 23 major versions of
Electron and has been fixed in the latest versions of those release
lines. Specifically, these versions contain the fixes: 22.0.1 and
23.0.0-alpha.2 We recommend all apps upgrade to the latest stable
version of Electron. If upgrading isn't possible, this issue can be
addressed without upgrading by enabling `sandbox: true` on all
renderers.

When Sanitize is configured with a custom allowlist that allows
`noscript` elements, attackers are able to include arbitrary HTML,
resulting in XSS (cross-site scripting) or other undesired behavior
when that HTML is rendered in a browser. The default configurations do
not allow `noscript` elements and are not vulnerable. This issue only

Metabase is an open source data analytics platform. Affected versions
are subject to Improper Privilege Management. As intended, recipients
of dashboards subscriptions can view the data as seen by the creator
of that subscription. This allows someone with greater access to data
to create a dashboard subscription, add people with fewer data
privileges, and all recipients of that subscription receive the same
data: the charts shown in the email would abide by the privileges of
the user who created the subscription. The issue is users with fewer
privileges who can view a dashboard are able to add themselves to a
dashboard subscription created by someone with additional data
privileges, and thus get access to more data via email. This issue is

An allocation of resources without limits or throttling vulnerability
exists in curl <v7.88.0 based on the "chained" HTTP compression
algorithms, meaning that a server response can be compressed multiple
times and potentially with differentalgorithms. The number of
acceptable "links" in this "decompression chain" wascapped, but the
cap was implemented on a per-header basis allowing a maliciousserver
to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps simply
byusing many headers. The use of such a decompression chain could
result in a "malloc bomb", making curl end up spending enormous
amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying to and returning out of
memory errors.

Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter. The URI validation on dompdf 2.0.1
can be bypassed on SVG parsing by passing `<image>` tags with
uppercase letters. This may lead to arbitrary object unserialize on
PHP < 8, through the `phar` URL wrapper. An attacker can exploit the
vulnerability to call arbitrary URL with arbitrary protocols, if they
can provide a SVG file to dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it
leads to arbitrary unserialize, that will lead to the very least to an
arbitrary file deletion and even remote code execution, depending on
classes that are available.

APOC (Awesome Procedures on Cypher) is an add-on library for Neo4j. An
XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerability found in the
apoc.import.graphml procedure of APOC core plugin prior to version
5.5.0 and 4.4.0.14 (4.4 branch) in Neo4j graph database. XML External
Entity (XXE) injection occurs when the XML parser allows external
entities to be resolved. The XML parser used by the
apoc.import.graphml procedure was not configured in a secure way and
therefore allowed this. External entities can be used to read local
files, send HTTP requests, and perform denial-of-service attacks on
the application. Abusing the XXE vulnerability enabled assessors to
read local files remotely. Although with the level of privileges
assessors had this was limited to one-line files. With the ability to
write to the database, any file could have been read. Additionally,
assessors noted, with local testing, the server could be crashed by
passing in improperly formatted XML. The minimum version containing a
patch for this vulnerability is 5.5.0. Those who cannot upgrade the
library can control the allowlist of the procedures that can be used
in your system.

cryptography is a package designed to expose cryptographic primitives
and recipes to Python developers. In affected versions
`Cipher.update_into` would accept Python objects which implement the
buffer protocol, but provide only immutable buffers. This would allow
immutable objects (such as `bytes`) to be mutated, thus violating
fundamental rules of Python and resulting in corrupted output. This
now correctly raises an exception. This issue has been present since
`update_into` was originally introduced in cryptography 1.8.

Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Browsers may
allow "nameless" cookies that look like `=value` instead of
`key=value`. A vulnerable browser may allow a compromised application
on an adjacent subdomain to exploit this to set a cookie like
`=__Host-test=bad` for another subdomain. Werkzeug prior to 2.2.3 will
parse the cookie `=__Host-test=bad` as __Host-test=bad`. If a Werkzeug
application is running next to a vulnerable or malicious subdomain
which sets such a cookie using a vulnerable browser, the Werkzeug
application will see the bad cookie value but the valid cookie key.
The issue is fixed in Werkzeug 2.2.3.

Discourse is an open-source messaging platform. In versions 3.0.1 and
prior on the `stable` branch and versions 3.1.0.beta2 and prior on the
`beta` and `tests-passed` branches, the count of personal messages
displayed for a tag is a count of all personal messages regardless of
whether the personal message is visible to a given user. As a result,
any users can technically poll a sensitive tag to determine if a new
personal message is created even if the user does not have access to
the personal message. In the patched versions, the count of personal
messages tagged with a given tag is hidden by default. To revert to
the old behaviour of displaying the count of personal messages for a
given tag, an admin may enable the
`display_personal_messages_tag_counts` site setting.

Azure/setup-kubectl is a GitHub Action for installing Kubectl. This
vulnerability only impacts versions before version 3. An insecure
temporary creation of a file allows other actors on the Actions runner
to replace the Kubectl binary created by this action because it is
world writable. This Kubectl tool installer runs
`fs.chmodSync(kubectlPath, 777)` to set permissions on the Kubectl
binary, however, this allows any local user to replace the Kubectl
binary. This allows privilege escalation to the user that can also run
kubectl, most likely root. This attack is only possible if an attacker
somehow breached the GitHub actions runner or if a user is utilizing
an Action that maliciously executes this attack. This has been fixed
and released in all versions `v3` and later. 775 permissions are used
instead. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
for this issue.

OpenZeppelin Contracts for Cairo is a library for secure smart
contract development written in Cairo for StarkNet, a decentralized ZK
Rollup. `is_valid_eth_signature` is missing a call to
`finalize_keccak` after calling `verify_eth_signature`. As a result,
any contract using `is_valid_eth_signature` from the account library
(such as the `EthAccount` preset) is vulnerable to a malicious
sequencer. Specifically, the malicious sequencer would be able to
bypass signature validation to impersonate an instance of these
accounts. The issue has been patched in 0.6.1.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. All Argo CD versions starting with 2.3.0-rc1 and prior to
2.3.17, 2.4.23 2.5.11, and 2.6.2 are vulnerable to an improper
authorization bug which allows users who have the ability to update at
least one cluster secret to update any cluster secret. The attacker
could use this access to escalate privileges (potentially controlling
Kubernetes resources) or to break Argo CD functionality (by preventing
connections to external clusters). A patch for this vulnerability has
been released in Argo CD versions 2.6.2, 2.5.11, 2.4.23, and 2.3.17.
Two workarounds are available. Either modify the RBAC configuration to
completely revoke all `clusters, update` access, or use the
`destinations` and `clusterResourceWhitelist` fields to apply similar
restrictions as the `namespaces` and `clusterResources` fields.

** DISPUTED ** Signal Desktop before 6.2.0 on Windows, Linux, and
macOS allows an attacker to modify conversation attachments within the
attachments.noindex directory. Client mechanisms fail to validate
modifications of existing cached files, resulting in an attacker's
ability to insert malicious code into pre-existing attachments or
replace them completely. A threat actor can forward the existing
attachment in the corresponding conversation to external groups, and
the name and size of the file will not change, allowing the malware to
masquerade as another file. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of
this finding because the product is not intended to protect against
adversaries with this degree of local access.

if it was previously replied to in a conversation. (Local filesystem
access is needed by the attacker.) NOTE: the vendor disputes the

A cross site request forgery vulnerability exists in Rockwell
Automation's FactoryTalk Vantagepoint. This vulnerability can be
exploited in two ways. If an attacker sends a malicious link to a
computer that is on the same domain as the FactoryTalk Vantagepoint
server and a user clicks the link, the attacker could impersonate the
legitimate user and send requests to the affected product.
Additionally, if an attacker sends an untrusted link to a computer
that is not on the same domain as the server and a user opens the
FactoryTalk Vantagepoint website, enters credentials for the
FactoryTalk Vantagepoint server, and clicks on the malicious link a
cross site request forgery attack would be successful as well.

HTTP and MIME header parsing can allocate large amounts of memory,
even when parsing small inputs, potentially leading to a denial of
service. Certain unusual patterns of input data can cause the common
function used to parse HTTP and MIME headers to allocate substantially
more memory than required to hold the parsed headers. An attacker can
exploit this behavior to cause an HTTP server to allocate large
amounts of memory from a small request, potentially leading to memory
exhaustion and a denial of service. With fix, header parsing now
correctly allocates only the memory required to hold parsed headers.

Multipart form parsing can consume large amounts of CPU and memory
when processing form inputs containing very large numbers of parts.
This stems from several causes: 1. mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm
limits the total memory a parsed multipart form can consume. ReadForm
can undercount the amount of memory consumed, leading it to accept
larger inputs than intended. 2. Limiting total memory does not account
for increased pressure on the garbage collector from large numbers of
small allocations in forms with many parts. 3. ReadForm can allocate a
large number of short-lived buffers, further increasing pressure on
the garbage collector. The combination of these factors can permit an
attacker to cause an program that parses multipart forms to consume
large amounts of CPU and memory, potentially resulting in a denial of
service. This affects programs that use
mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm, as well as form parsing in the
net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue,
ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. With fix, ReadForm now does a
better job of estimating the memory consumption of parsed forms, and
performs many fewer short-lived allocations. In addition, the fixed
mime/multipart.Reader imposes the following limits on the size of
parsed forms: 1. Forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than
1000 parts. This limit may be adjusted with the environment variable
GODEBUG=multipartmaxparts=. 2. Form parts parsed with NextPart and
NextRawPart may contain no more than 10,000 header fields. In
addition, forms parsed with ReadForm may contain no more than 10,000
header fields across all parts. This limit may be adjusted with the
environment variable GODEBUG=multipartmaxheaders=.

Templates do not properly consider backticks (`) as Javascript string
delimiters, and do not escape them as expected. Backticks are used,
since ES6, for JS template literals. If a template contains a Go
template action within a Javascript template literal, the contents of
the action can be used to terminate the literal, injecting arbitrary
Javascript code into the Go template. As ES6 template literals are
rather complex, and themselves can do string interpolation, the
decision was made to simply disallow Go template actions from being
used inside of them (e.g. "var a = {{.}}"), since there is no
obviously safe way to allow this behavior. This takes the same
approach as github.com/google/safehtml. With fix, Template.Parse
returns an Error when it encounters templates like this, with an
ErrorCode of value 12. This ErrorCode is currently unexported, but
will be exported in the release of Go 1.21. Users who rely on the
previous behavior can re-enable it using the GODEBUG flag
jstmpllitinterp=1, with the caveat that backticks will now be escaped.
This should be used with caution.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/05/msg00021.html

cups-filters contains backends, filters, and other software required
to get the cups printing service working on operating systems other
than macos. If you use the Backend Error Handler (beh) to create an
accessible network printer, this security vulnerability can cause
remote code execution. `beh.c` contains the line `retval =
system(cmdline) >> 8;` which calls the `system` command with the
operand `cmdline`. `cmdline` contains multiple user controlled,
unsanitized values. As a result an attacker with network access to the
hosted print server can exploit this vulnerability to inject system
commands which are executed in the context of the running server. This
issue has been addressed in commit `8f2740357` and is expected to be
bundled in the next release. Users are advised to upgrade when
possible and to restrict access to network printers in the meantime.

Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client for Node.js. Prior to version 5.19.1, the
`Headers.set()` and `Headers.append()` methods are vulnerable to
Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) attacks when untrusted
values are passed into the functions. This is due to the inefficient
regular expression used to normalize the values in the
`headerValueNormalize()` utility function. This vulnerability was
patched in v5.19.1. No known workarounds are available.

PDFio is a C library for reading and writing PDF files. In versions
prior to 1.1.0 a denial of service (DOS) vulnerability exists in the
pdfio parser. Crafted pdf files can cause the program to run at 100%
utilization and never terminate. The pdf which causes this crash found
in testing is about 28kb in size and was discovered via fuzzing.
Anyone who uses this library either as a standalone binary or as a
library can be DOSed when attempting to parse this type of file. Web
servers or other automated processes which rely on this code to turn
pdf submissions into plaintext can be DOSed when an attacker uploads
the pdf. Please see the linked GHSA for an example pdf. Users are
advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter written in php. Due to the
difference in the attribute parser of Dompdf and php-svg-lib, an
attacker can still call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols.
Dompdf parses the href attribute of `image` tags and respects
`xlink:href` even if `href` is specified. However, php-svg-lib, which
is later used to parse the svg file, parses the href attribute. Since
`href` is respected if both `xlink:href` and `href` is specified, it's
possible to bypass the protection on the Dompdf side by providing an
empty `xlink:href` attribute. An attacker can exploit the
vulnerability to call arbitrary URLs with arbitrary protocols if they
provide an SVG file to the Dompdf. In PHP versions before 8.0.0, it
leads to arbitrary unserialize, which will lead, at the very least, to
arbitrary file deletion and might lead to remote code execution,
depending on available classes. This vulnerability has been addressed
in commit `95009ea98` which has been included in release version
2.0.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
for this vulnerability.

TYPO3 is a free and open source Content Management Framework released
under the GNU General Public License. In affected versions the TYPO3
core component `GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv()` uses the unfiltered
server environment variable `PATH_INFO`, which allows attackers to
inject malicious content. In combination with the TypoScript setting
`config.absRefPrefix=auto`, attackers can inject malicious HTML code
to pages that have not been rendered and cached, yet. As a result,
injected values would be cached and delivered to other website
visitors (persisted cross-site scripting). Individual code which
relies on the resolved value of
`GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv('SCRIPT_NAME')` and corresponding usages
(as shown below) are vulnerable as well. Additional investigations
confirmed that at least Apache web server deployments using CGI (FPM,
FCGI/FastCGI, and similar) are affected. However, there still might be
the risk that other scenarios like nginx, IIS, or Apache/mod_php are
vulnerable. The usage of server environment variable `PATH_INFO` has
been removed from corresponding processings in
`GeneralUtility::getIndpEnv()`. Besides that, the public property
`TypoScriptFrontendController::$absRefPrefix` is encoded for both
being used as a URI component and for being used as a prefix in an
HTML context. This mitigates the cross-site scripting vulnerability.
Users are advised to update to TYPO3 versions 8.7.51 ELTS, 9.5.40
ELTS, 10.4.35 LTS, 11.5.23 LTS and 12.2.0 which fix this problem. For
users who are unable to patch in a timely manner the TypoScript
setting `config.absRefPrefix` should at least be set to a static path
value, instead of using auto - e.g. `config.absRefPrefix=/`. This
workaround **does not fix all aspects of the vulnerability**, and is
just considered to be an intermediate mitigation to the most prominent
manifestation.

Vert.x-Web is a set of building blocks for building web applications
in the java programming language. When running vertx web applications
that serve files using `StaticHandler` on Windows Operating Systems
and Windows File Systems, if the mount point is a wildcard (`*`) then
an attacker can exfiltrate any class path resource. When computing the
relative path to locate the resource, in case of wildcards, the code:
`return "/" + rest;` from `Utils.java` returns the user input (without
validation) as the segment to lookup. Even though checks are performed
to avoid escaping the sandbox, given that the input was not sanitized
`\` are not properly handled and an attacker can build a path that is
valid within the classpath. This issue only affects users deploying in
windows environments and upgrading is the advised remediation path.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive
computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for
the Python programming language. Versions prior to 8.1.0 are subject
to a command injection vulnerability with very specific prerequisites.
This vulnerability requires that the function
`IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` be called on Windows in a
Python environment where ctypes is not available. The dependency on
`ctypes` in `IPython.utils._process_win32` prevents the vulnerable
code from ever being reached in the ipython binary. However, as a
library that could be used by another tool `set_term_title` could be
called and hence introduce a vulnerability. Should an attacker get
untrusted input to an instance of this function they would be able to
inject shell commands as current process and limited to the scope of
the current process. Users of ipython as a library are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that any calls to the
`IPython.utils.terminal.set_term_title` function are done with trusted
or filtered input.

syft is a a CLI tool and Go library for generating a Software Bill of
Materials (SBOM) from container images and filesystems. A password
disclosure flaw was found in Syft versions v0.69.0 and v0.69.1. This
flaw leaks the password stored in the SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD environment
variable. The `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable is for the
`syft attest` command to generate attested SBOMs for the given
container image. This environment variable is used to decrypt the
private key (provided with `syft attest --key <path-to-key-file>`)
during the signing process while generating an SBOM attestation. This
vulnerability affects users running syft that have the
`SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` environment variable set with credentials
(regardless of if the attest command is being used or not). Users that
do not have the environment variable `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD` set are
not affected by this issue. The credentials are leaked in two ways: in
the syft logs when `-vv` or `-vvv` are used in the syft command (which
is any log level >= `DEBUG`) and in the attestation or SBOM only when
the `syft-json` format is used. Note that as of v0.69.0 any generated
attestations by the `syft attest` command are uploaded to the OCI
registry (if you have write access to that registry) in the same way
`cosign attach` is done. This means that any attestations generated
for the affected versions of syft when the `SYFT_ATTEST_PASSWORD`
environment variable was set would leak credentials in the attestation
payload uploaded to the OCI registry. This issue has been patched in
commit `9995950c70` and has been released as v0.70.0. There are no
workarounds for this vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade.

The Go Pricing - WordPress Responsive Pricing Tables plugin for
WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in versions up to, and
including, 3.3.19 via deserialization of untrusted input from the
'go_pricing' shortcode 'data' parameter. This allows authenticated
attackers, with subscriber-level permissions and above, to inject a
PHP Object. No POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP
chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the
target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files,
retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

Prior to version v1.20230419.0, the FormData API implementation was
subject to an integer overflow. If a FormData instance contained more
than 2^31 elements, the forEach() method could end up reading from the
wrong location in memory while iterating over elements. This would
most likely lead to a segmentation fault, but could theoretically
allow arbitrary undefined behavior. In order for the bug to be
exploitable, the process would need to be able to allocate 160GB of
RAM. Due to this, the bug was never exploitable on the Cloudflare
Workers platform, but could theoretically be exploitable on
deployments of workerd running on machines with a huge amount of
memory. Moreover, in order to be remotely exploited, an attacker would
have to upload a single form-encoded HTTP request of at least tens of
gigabytes in size. The application code would then have to use
request.formData() to parse the request and formData.forEach() to
iterate over this data. Due to these limitations, the exploitation
likelihood was considered Low. A fix that addresses this vulnerability
has been released in version v1.20230419.0 and users are encouraged to
update to the latest version available.

OpenSSH server (sshd) 9.1 introduced a double-free vulnerability
during options.kex_algorithms handling. This is fixed in OpenSSH 9.2.
The double free can be leveraged, by an unauthenticated remote
attacker in the default configuration, to jump to any location in the
sshd address space. One third-party report states "remote code
execution is theoretically possible."

TimescaleDB, an open-source time-series SQL database, has a privilege
escalation vulnerability in versions 2.8.0 through 2.9.2. During
installation, TimescaleDB creates a telemetry job that is runs as the
installation user. The queries run as part of the telemetry data
collection were not run with a locked down `search_path`, allowing
malicious users to create functions that would be executed by the
telemetry job, leading to privilege escalation. In order to be able to
take advantage of this vulnerability, a user would need to be able to
create objects in a database and then get a superuser to install
TimescaleDB into their database. When TimescaleDB is installed as
trusted extension, non-superusers can install the extension without
help from a superuser. Version 2.9.3 fixes this issue. As a
mitigation, the `search_path` of the user running the telemetry job
can be locked down to not include schemas writable by other users. The
vulnerability is not exploitable on instances in Timescale Cloud and
Managed Service for TimescaleDB due to additional security provisions
in place on those platforms.

opentelemetry-go-contrib is a collection of extensions for
OpenTelemetry-Go. The v0.38.0 release of
`go.opentelemetry.io/contrib/instrumentation/net/http/otelhttp` uses
the `httpconv.ServerRequest` function to annotate metric measurements
for the `http.server.request_content_length`,
`http.server.response_content_length`, and `http.server.duration`
instruments. The `ServerRequest` function sets the `http.target`
attribute value to be the whole request URI (including the query
string)[^1]. The metric instruments do not "forget" previous
measurement attributes when `cumulative` temporality is used, this
means the cardinality of the measurements allocated is directly
correlated with the unique URIs handled. If the query string is
constantly random, this will result in a constant increase in memory
allocation that can be used in a denial-of-service attack. This issue
has been addressed in version 0.39.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Wings is Pterodactyl's server control plane. Affected versions are
subject to a vulnerability which can be used to create new files and
directory structures on the host system that previously did not exist,
potentially allowing attackers to change their resource allocations,
promote their containers to privileged mode, or potentially add ssh
authorized keys to allow the attacker access to a remote shell on the
target machine. In order to use this exploit, an attacker must have an
existing "server" allocated and controlled by the Wings Daemon. This
vulnerability has been resolved in version `v1.11.3` of the Wings
Daemon, and has been back-ported to the 1.7 release series in
`v1.7.3`. Anyone running `v1.11.x` should upgrade to `v1.11.3` and
anyone running `v1.7.x` should upgrade to `v1.7.3`. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability. ### Workarounds None at this time.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v2.6.0-rc1 have an
output sanitization bug which leaks repository access credentials in
error messages. These error messages are visible to the user, and they
are logged. The error message is visible when a user attempts to
create or update an Application via the Argo CD API (and therefor the
UI or CLI). The user must have `applications, create` or
`applications, update` RBAC access to reach the code which may produce
the error. The user is not guaranteed to be able to trigger the error
message. They may attempt to spam the API with requests to trigger a
rate limit error from the upstream repository. If the user has
`repositories, update` access, they may edit an existing repository to
introduce a URL typo or otherwise force an error message. But if they
have that level of access, they are probably intended to have access
to the credentials anyway. A patch for this vulnerability has been
released in version 2.6.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this vulnerability.

vulnerability does not affect you. If you are affected and your Tina-
enabled website has sensitive credentials stored as environment
variables (eg. Algolia API keys) you should rotate those keys
immediately. This issue has been patched in @tinacms/cli@1.0.9. Users
are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Helm is a tool that streamlines installing and managing Kubernetes
applications.`getHostByName` is a Helm template function introduced in
Helm v3. The function is able to accept a hostname and return an IP
address for that hostname. To get the IP address the function performs
a DNS lookup. The DNS lookup happens when used with `helm
install|upgrade|template` or when the Helm SDK is used to render a
chart. Information passed into the chart can be disclosed to the DNS
servers used to lookup the IP address. For example, a malicious chart
could inject `getHostByName` into a chart in order to disclose values
to a malicious DNS server. The issue has been fixed in Helm 3.11.1.
Prior to using a chart with Helm verify the `getHostByName` function
is not being used in a template to disclose any information you do not
want passed to DNS servers.

denial-of-service attacks against the Password reset page. An attacker
could potentially send a large number of emails if they know the email
addresses of users in Kiwi TCMS. Additionally that may strain SMTP
resources. Users should upgrade to v12.0 or later to receive a patch.
As potential workarounds, users may install and configure a rate-
limiting proxy in front of Kiwi TCMS and/or configure rate limits on
their email server when possible.

containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in
containerd prior to versions 1.6.18 and 1.5.18 where supplementary
groups are not set up properly inside a container. If an attacker has
direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group
access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass
primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access
to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in
that container. Downstream applications that use the containerd client
library may be affected as well. This bug has been fixed in containerd
v1.6.18 and v.1.5.18. Users should update to these versions and
recreate containers to resolve this issue. Users who rely on a
downstream application that uses containerd's client library should
check that application for a separate advisory and instructions. As a
workaround, ensure that the `"USER $USERNAME"` Dockerfile instruction
is not used. Instead, set the container entrypoint to a value similar
to `ENTRYPOINT ["su", "-", "user"]` to allow `su` to properly set up
supplementary groups.

An issue was discovered on NOKIA Airscale ASIKA Single RAN devices
before 21B. Nokia Single RAN commissioning procedures do not change
(factory-time installed) default SSH public/private key values that
are specific to a network operator. As a result, the CSP internal BTS
network SSH server (disabled by default) continues to apply the
default SSH public/private key values. These keys don't give access to
BTS, because service user authentication is username/password-based on
top of SSH. Nokia factory installed default SSH keys are meant to be
changed from operator-specific values during the BTS deployment
commissioning phase. However, before the 21B release, BTS
commissioning manuals did not provide instructions to change default
SSH keys (to BTS operator-specific values). This leads to a
possibility for malicious operations staff (inside a CSP network) to
attempt MITM exploitation of BTS service user access, during the
moments that SSH is enabled for Nokia service personnel to perform
troubleshooting activities.

A possible security vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka
Connect API. This requires access to a Kafka Connect worker, and the
ability to create/modify connectors on it with an arbitrary Kafka
client SASL JAAS config and a SASL-based security protocol, which has
been possible on Kafka Connect clusters since Apache Kafka Connect
2.3.0. When configuring the connector via the Kafka Connect REST API,
an authenticated operator can set the `sasl.jaas.config` property for
any of the connector's Kafka clients to
"com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule", which can be done via
the `producer.override.sasl.jaas.config`,
`consumer.override.sasl.jaas.config`, or
`admin.override.sasl.jaas.config` properties. This will allow the
server to connect to the attacker's LDAP server and deserialize the
LDAP response, which the attacker can use to execute java
deserialization gadget chains on the Kafka connect server. Attacker
can cause unrestricted deserialization of untrusted data (or) RCE
vulnerability when there are gadgets in the classpath. Since Apache
Kafka 3.0.0, users are allowed to specify these properties in
connector configurations for Kafka Connect clusters running with out-
of-the-box configurations. Before Apache Kafka 3.0.0, users may not
specify these properties unless the Kafka Connect cluster has been
reconfigured with a connector client override policy that permits
them. Since Apache Kafka 3.4.0, we have added a system property
("-Dorg.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules") to disable the
problematic login modules usage in SASL JAAS configuration. Also by
default "com.sun.security.auth.module.JndiLoginModule" is disabled in
Apache Kafka Connect 3.4.0. We advise the Kafka Connect users to
validate connector configurations and only allow trusted JNDI
configurations. Also examine connector dependencies for vulnerable
versions and either upgrade their connectors, upgrading that specific
dependency, or removing the connectors as options for remediation.
Finally, in addition to leveraging the
"org.apache.kafka.disallowed.login.modules" system property, Kafka
Connect users can also implement their own connector client config
override policy, which can be used to control which Kafka client
properties can be overridden directly in a connector config and which
cannot.

Stimulsoft GmbH Stimulsoft Designer (Web) 2023.1.3 is vulnerable to
Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF). TThe Reporting Designer (Web)
offers the possibility to embed sources from external locations. If
the user chooses an external location, the request to that resource is
performed by the server rather than the client. Therefore, the server
causes outbound traffic and potentially imports data. An attacker may
also leverage this behaviour to exfiltrate data of machines on the
internal network of the server hosting the Stimulsoft Reporting

DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. The DataHub frontend acts
as a proxy able to forward any REST or GraphQL requests to the
backend. The goal of this proxy is to perform authentication if needed
and forward HTTP requests to the DataHub Metadata Store (GMS). It has
been discovered that the proxy does not adequately construct the URL
when forwarding data to GMS, allowing external users to reroute
requests from the DataHub Frontend to any arbitrary hosts. As a result
attackers may be able to reroute a request from originating from the
frontend proxy to any other server and return the result. This
vulnerability was discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab
and is tracked as GHSL-2022-076.

DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. When the DataHub frontend
is configured to authenticate via SSO, it will leverage the pac4j
library. The processing of the `id_token` is done in an unsafe manner
which is not properly accounted for by the DataHub frontend.
Specifically, if any of the id_token claims value start with the
{#sb64} prefix, pac4j considers the value to be a serialized Java
object and will deserialize it. This issue may lead to Remote Code
Execution (RCE) in the worst case. Although a
`RestrictedObjectInputStream` is in place, that puts some restriction
on what classes can be deserialized, it still allows a broad range of
java packages and potentially exploitable with different gadget
chains. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds.

DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. When not using
authentication for the metadata service, which is the default
configuration, the Metadata service (GMS) will use the X-DataHub-Actor
HTTP header to infer the user the frontend is sending the request on
behalf of. When the backends retrieves the header, its name is
retrieved in a case-insensitive way. This case differential can be
abused by an attacker to smuggle an X-DataHub-Actor header with
different casing (eg: X-DATAHUB-ACTOR). This issue may lead to an
authorization bypass by allowing any user to impersonate the system
user account and perform any actions on its behalf. This vulnerability
was discovered and reported by the GitHub Security lab and is tracked
as GHSL-2022-079.

DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. The AuthServiceClient
which is responsible for creation of new accounts, verifying
credentials, resetting them or requesting access tokens, crafts
multiple JSON strings using format strings with user-controlled data.
This means that an attacker may be able to augment these JSON strings
to be sent to the backend and that can potentially be abused by
including new or colliding values. This issue may lead to an
authentication bypass and the creation of system accounts, which
effectively can lead to full system compromise. Users are advised to

DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. In the event a system is
using Java Authentication and Authorization Service (JAAS)
authentication and that system is given a configuration which contains
an error, the authentication for the system will fail open and allow
an attacker to login using any username and password. The reason for
this is that while an error is thrown in the `authenticateJaasUser`
method it is swallowed without propagating the error. As a result of
this issue unauthenticated users may gain access to the system. Users

GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that
implements NTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0, multiple out-
of-bounds reads when decoding NTLM fields can trigger a denial of
service. A 32-bit integer overflow condition can lead to incorrect
checks of consistency of length of internal buffers. Although most
applications will error out before accepting a singe input buffer of
4GB in length this could theoretically happen. This vulnerability can
be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point if the
application allows tokens greater than 4GB in length. This can lead to
a large, up to 65KB, out-of-bounds read which could cause a denial-of-
service if it reads from unmapped memory. Version 1.2.0 contains a
patch for the out-of-bounds reads.

GSS-NTLMSSP is a mechglue plugin for the GSSAPI library that
implements NTLM authentication. Prior to version 1.2.0, memory
corruption can be triggered when decoding UTF16 strings. The variable
`outlen` was not initialized and could cause writing a zero to an
arbitrary place in memory if `ntlm_str_convert()` were to fail, which
would leave `outlen` uninitialized. This can lead to a denial of
service if the write hits unmapped memory or randomly corrupts a byte
in the application memory space. This vulnerability can trigger an
out-of-bounds write, leading to memory corruption. This vulnerability
can be triggered via the main `gss_accept_sec_context` entry point.
This issue is fixed in version 1.2.0.

Boxo, formerly known as go-libipfs, is a library for building IPFS
applications and implementations. In versions 0.4.0 and 0.5.0, if an
attacker is able allocate arbitrary many bytes in the Bitswap server,
those allocations are lasting even if the connection is closed. This
affects users accepting untrusted connections with the Bitswap server
and also affects users using the old API stubs at `github.com/ipfs/go-
libipfs/bitswap` because users then transitively import
`github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/server`. Boxo versions 0.6.0 and
0.4.1 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, those who are
using the stub object at `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap` not
taking advantage of the features provided by the server can refactor
their code to use the new split API that will allow them to run in a
client only mode: `github.com/ipfs/go-libipfs/bitswap/client`.

Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals.
`@backstage/catalog-model` prior to version 1.2.0, `@backstage/core-
components` prior to 0.12.4, and `@backstage/plugin-catalog-backend`
prior to 1.7.2 are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability.
This vulnerability allows a malicious actor with access to add or
modify content in an instance of the Backstage software catalog to
inject script URLs in the entities stored in the catalog. If users of
the catalog then click on said URLs, that can lead to an XSS attack.
This vulnerability has been patched in both the frontend and backend
implementations. The default `Link` component from `@backstage/core-
components` version 1.2.0 and greater will now reject `javascript:`
URLs, and there is a global override of `window.open` to do the same.
In addition, the catalog model v0.12.4 and greater as well as the
catalog backend v1.7.2 and greater now has additional validation built
in that prevents `javascript:` URLs in known annotations. As a
workaround, the general practice of limiting access to modifying
catalog content and requiring code reviews greatly help mitigate this
vulnerability.

`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without client-side sanitization. If the
data isn't sanitized server-side, this opens a possible cross-site
scripting (XSS) attack. Versions 3.19.12 and 4.7.6 now use `DOMPurify`
to escape the HTML before outputting it with React and
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. Users who already sanitize HTML data
server-side do not need to upgrade. As a workaround, users may replace
the `<RichTextField>` by a custom field doing sanitization by hand.

API Platform Core is the server component of API Platform: hypermedia
and GraphQL APIs. Resource properties secured with the `security`
option of the `ApiPlatform\Metadata\ApiProperty` attribute can be
disclosed to unauthorized users. The problem affects most
serialization formats, including raw JSON, which is enabled by default
when installing API Platform. Custom serialization formats may also be
impacted. Only collection endpoints are affected by the issue, item
endpoints are not. The JSON-LD format is not affected by the issue.
The result of the security rule is only executed for the first item of
the collection. The result of the rule is then cached and reused for
the next items. This bug can leak data to unauthorized users when the
rule depends on the value of a property of the item. This bug can also
hide properties that should be displayed to authorized users. This
issue impacts the 2.7, 3.0 and 3.1 branches. Please upgrade to
versions 2.7.10, 3.0.12 or 3.1.3. As a workaround, replace the
`cache_key` of the context array of the Serializer inside a custom
normalizer that works on objects if the security option of the
`ApiPlatform\Metadata\ApiProperty` attribute is used.

@fastify/multipart is a Fastify plugin to parse the multipart content-
type. Prior to versions 7.4.1 and 6.0.1, @fastify/multipart may
experience denial of service due to a number of situations in which an
unlimited number of parts are accepted. This includes the multipart
body parser accepting an unlimited number of file parts, the multipart
body parser accepting an unlimited number of field parts, and the
multipart body parser accepting an unlimited number of empty parts as
field parts. This is fixed in v7.4.1 (for Fastify v4.x) and v6.0.1
(for Fastify v3.x). There are no known workarounds.

Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. Prior to
version 2.2.3, Werkzeug's multipart form data parser will parse an
unlimited number of parts, including file parts. Parts can be a small
amount of bytes, but each requires CPU time to parse and may use more
memory as Python data. If a request can be made to an endpoint that
accesses `request.data`, `request.form`, `request.files`, or
`request.get_data(parse_form_data=False)`, it can cause unexpectedly
high resource usage. This allows an attacker to cause a denial of
service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will
parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes
from handling legitimate requests. The amount of RAM required can
trigger an out of memory kill of the process. Unlimited file parts can
use up memory and file handles. If many concurrent requests are sent
continuously, this can exhaust or kill all available workers. Version
2.2.3 contains a patch for this issue.

Starlite is an Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) framework.
Prior to version 1.5.2, the request body parsing in `starlite` allows
a potentially unauthenticated attacker to consume a large amount of
CPU time and RAM. The multipart body parser processes an unlimited
number of file parts and an unlimited number of field parts. This is a
remote, potentially unauthenticated Denial of Service vulnerability.
This vulnerability affects applications with a request handler that
accepts a `Body(media_type=RequestEncodingType.MULTI_PART)`. The large
amount of CPU time required for processing requests can block all
available worker processes and significantly delay or slow down the
processing of legitimate user requests. The large amount of RAM
accumulated while processing requests can lead to Out-Of-Memory kills.
Complete DoS is achievable by sending many concurrent multipart
requests in a loop. Version 1.51.2 contains a patch for this issue.

2.40.1, by feeding specially crafted input to `git apply --reject`, a
path outside the working tree can be overwritten with partially
controlled contents (corresponding to the rejected hunk(s) from the
given patch). A fix is available in versions 2.30.9, 2.31.8, 2.32.7,

a workaround, avoid using `git apply` with `--reject` when applying
patches from an untrusted source. Use `git apply --stat` to inspect a
patch before applying; avoid applying one that create a conflict where
a link corresponding to the `*.rej` file exists.

node-jose is a JavaScript implementation of the JSON Object Signing
and Encryption (JOSE) for web browsers and node.js-based servers.
Prior to version 2.2.0, when using the non-default "fallback" crypto
back-end, ECC operations in `node-jose` can trigger a Denial-of-
Service (DoS) condition, due to a possible infinite loop in an
internal calculation. For some ECC operations, this condition is
triggered randomly; for others, it can be triggered by malicious
input. The issue has been patched in version 2.2.0. Since this issue
is only present in the "fallback" crypto implementation, it can be
avoided by ensuring that either WebCrypto or the Node `crypto` module
is available in the JS environment where `node-jose` is being run.

own trust policy file and check if the identity string contains `=#`.
Meanwhile, users should only put trusted certificates in their trust
stores referenced by their own trust policy files, and make sure the

Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform.
All users of Nautobot versions earlier than 1.5.7 are impacted by a
remote code execution vulnerability. Nautobot did not properly sandbox
Jinja2 template rendering. In Nautobot 1.5.7 has enabled sandboxed
environments for the Jinja2 template engine used internally for
template rendering for the following objects: `extras.ComputedField`,
`extras.CustomLink`, `extras.ExportTemplate`, `extras.Secret`,
`extras.Webhook`. While no active exploits of this vulnerability are
known this change has been made as a preventative measure to protect
against any potential remote code execution attacks utilizing
maliciously crafted template code. This change forces the Jinja2
template engine to use a `SandboxedEnvironment` on all new
installations of Nautobot. This addresses any potential unsafe code
execution everywhere the helper function
`nautobot.utilities.utils.render_jinja2` is called. Additionally, the
documentation that had previously suggesting the direct use of
`jinja2.Template` has been revised to suggest `render_jinja2`. Users
are advised to upgrade to Nautobot 1.5.7 or newer. For users that are
unable to upgrade to the latest release of Nautobot, you may add the
following setting to your `nautobot_config.py` to apply the sandbox
environment enforcement: `TEMPLATES[1]["OPTIONS"]["environment"] =
"jinja2.sandbox.SandboxedEnvironment"` After applying this change, you
must restart all Nautobot services, including any Celery worker
processes. **Note:** *Nautobot specifies two template engines by
default, the first being &#8220;django&#8221; for the Django built-in template
engine, and the second being &#8220;jinja&#8221; for the Jinja2 template engine.
This recommended setting will update the second item in the list of
template engines, which is the Jinja2 engine.* For users that are
unable to immediately update their configuration such as if a Nautobot
service restart is too disruptive to operations, access to provide
custom Jinja2 template values may be mitigated using permissions to
restrict &#8220;change&#8221; (write) actions to the affected object types listed
in the first section. **Note:** *This solution is intended to be
stopgap until you can successfully update your `nautobot_config.py` or
upgrade your Nautobot instance to apply the sandboxed environment
enforcement.*

TensorFlow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In versions
prior to 2.11.1 a malicious invalid input crashes a tensorflow model
(Check Failed) and can be used to trigger a denial of service attack.
A proof of concept can be constructed with the
`Convolution3DTranspose` function. This Convolution3DTranspose layer
is a very common API in modern neural networks. The ML models
containing such vulnerable components could be deployed in ML
applications or as cloud services. This failure could be potentially
used to trigger a denial of service attack on ML cloud services. An
attacker must have privilege to provide input to a
`Convolution3DTranspose` call. This issue has been patched and users
are advised to upgrade to version 2.11.1. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

Some mod_proxy configurations on Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.0
through 2.4.55 allow a HTTP Request Smuggling attack. Configurations
are affected when mod_proxy is enabled along with some form of
RewriteRule or ProxyPassMatch in which a non-specific pattern matches
some portion of the user-supplied request-target (URL) data and is
then re-inserted into the proxied request-target using variable
substitution. For example, something like: RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule "^/here/(.*)" "http://example.com:8080/elsewhere?$1"; [P]
ProxyPassReverse /here/ http://example.com:8080/ Request
splitting/smuggling could result in bypass of access controls in the
proxy server, proxying unintended URLs to existing origin servers, and
cache poisoning. Users are recommended to update to at least version
2.4.56 of Apache HTTP Server.

** DISPUTED ** In ConnectWise Control through 22.9.10032 (formerly
known as ScreenConnect), after an executable file is signed,
additional instructions can be added without invalidating the
signature, such as instructions that result in offering the end user a
(different) attacker-controlled executable file. It is plausible that
the end user may allow the download and execution of this file to
proceed. There are ConnectWise Control configuration options that add
mitigations. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2023-25719. NOTE: the vendor's
position is that this purported vulnerability represents a
"fundamental lack of understanding of Authenticode code signing
behavior."

HAProxy before 2.7.3 may allow a bypass of access control because
HTTP/1 headers are inadvertently lost in some situations, aka "request
smuggling." The HTTP header parsers in HAProxy may accept empty header
field names, which could be used to truncate the list of HTTP headers
and thus make some headers disappear after being parsed and processed
for HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1. For HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the impact is
limited because the headers disappear before being parsed and
processed, as if they had not been sent by the client. The fixed
versions are 2.7.3, 2.6.9, 2.5.12, 2.4.22, 2.2.29, and 2.0.31.
