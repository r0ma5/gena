The Modal Window plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-
Site Scripting via shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 5.3.5
due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user
supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject
arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
accesses an injected page.

Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform
built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a
PostgreSQL or MySQL database. When submitting a Job to run via a Job
Button, only the model-level `extras.run_job` permission is checked
(i.e., does the user have permission to run Jobs in general). Object-
level permissions (i.e., does the user have permission to run this
specific Job?) are not enforced by the URL/view used in this case. A
user with permissions to run even a single Job can actually run all
configured JobButton Jobs. Fix will be available in Nautobot 1.6.8 and

AWS SDK for PHP is the Amazon Web Services software development kit
for PHP. Within the scope of requests to S3 object keys and/or
prefixes containing a Unix double-dot, a URI path traversal is
possible. The issue exists in the `buildEndpoint` method in the
RestSerializer component of the AWS SDK for PHP v3 prior to 3.288.1.
The `buildEndpoint` method relies on the Guzzle Psr7 UriResolver
utility, which strips dot segments from the request path in accordance
with RFC 3986. Under certain conditions, this could lead to an
arbitrary object being accessed. This issue has been patched in
version 3.288.1.

OWASP AntiSamy .NET is a library for performing cleansing of HTML
coming from untrusted sources. Prior to version 1.2.0, there is a
potential for a mutation cross-site scripting (mXSS) vulnerability in
AntiSamy caused by flawed parsing of the HTML being sanitized. To be
subject to this vulnerability the `preserveComments` directive must be
enabled in your policy file and also allow for certain tags at the
same time. As a result, certain crafty inputs can result in elements
in comment tags being interpreted as executable when using AntiSamy's
sanitized output. This is patched in OWASP AntiSamy .NET 1.2.0 and
later. See important remediation details in the reference given below.
As a workaround, manually edit the AntiSamy policy file (e.g.,
antisamy.xml) by deleting the `preserveComments` directive or setting
its value to `false`, if present. Also it would be useful to make
AntiSamy remove the `noscript` tag by adding a line described in the
GitHub Security Advisory to the tag definitions under the `<tagrules>`
node, or deleting it entirely if present. As the previously mentioned
policy settings are preconditions for the mXSS attack to work,
changing them as recommended should be sufficient to protect you
against this vulnerability when using a vulnerable version of this
library. However, the existing bug would still be present in AntiSamy
or its parser dependency (HtmlAgilityPack). The safety of this
workaround relies on configurations that may change in the future and
don't address the root cause of the vulnerability. As such, it is
strongly recommended to upgrade to a fixed version of AntiSamy.

The Snowflake .NET driver provides an interface to the Microsoft .NET
open source software framework for developing applications. Snowflake
recently received a report about a vulnerability in the Snowflake
Connector .NET where the checks against the Certificate Revocation
List (CRL) were not performed where the insecureMode flag was set to
false, which is the default setting. The vulnerability affects
versions between 2.0.25 and 2.1.4 (inclusive). Snowflake fixed the
issue in version 2.1.5.

Hail is an open-source, general-purpose, Python-based data analysis
tool with additional data types and methods for working with genomic
data. Hail relies on OpenID Connect (OIDC) email addresses from ID
tokens to verify the validity of a user's domain, but because users
have the ability to change their email address, they could create
accounts and use resources in clusters that they should not have
access to. For example, a user could create a Microsoft or Google
account and then change their email to `test@example.org`. This
account can then be used to create a Hail Batch account in Hail Batch
clusters whose organization domain is `example.org`. The attacker is
not able to access private data or impersonate another user, but they
would have the ability to run jobs if Hail Batch billing projects are
enabled and create Azure Tenants if they have Azure Active Directory
Administrator access.

Unofficial Mobile BankID Integration for WordPress lets users employ
Mobile BankID to authenticate themselves on your WordPress site. Prior
to 1.0.1, WP-Mobile-BankID-Integration is affected by a vulnerability
classified as a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability,
specifically impacting scenarios where an attacker can manipulate the
database. If unauthorized actors gain access to the database, they
could exploit this vulnerability to execute object injection attacks.
This could lead to unauthorized code execution, data manipulation, or
data exfiltration within the WordPress environment. Users of the
plugin should upgrade to version 1.0.1 (or later), where the
serialization and deserialization of OrderResponse objects have been
switched out to an array stored as JSON. A possible workaround for
users unable to upgrade immediately is to enforce stricter access
controls on the database, ensuring that only trusted and authorized
entities can modify data. Additionally, implementing monitoring tools
to detect unusual database activities could help identify and mitigate
potential exploitation attempts.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20240124 CVE-2023-51702: Apache Airflow CNCF Kubernetes provider, Apache Airflow: Kubernetes configuration file saved without encryption in the Metadata and logged as plain text in the Triggerer service
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/24/3

Since version 5.2.0, when using deferrable mode with the path of a
Kubernetes configuration file for authentication, the Airflow worker
serializes this configuration file as a dictionary and sends it to the
triggerer by storing it in metadata without any encryption.
Additionally, if used with an Airflow version between 2.3.0 and 2.6.0,
the configuration dictionary will be logged as plain text in the
triggerer service without masking. This allows anyone with access to
the metadata or triggerer log to obtain the configuration file and use
it to access the Kubernetes cluster. This behavior was changed in
version 7.0.0, which stopped serializing the file contents and started
providing the file path instead to read the contents into the trigger.
Users are recommended to upgrade to version 7.0.0, which fixes this
issue.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/27/4

Apache James prior to versions 3.8.1 and 3.7.5 is vulnerable to SMTP
smuggling. A lenient behaviour in line delimiter handling might create
a difference of interpretation between the sender and the receiver
which can be exploited by an attacker to forge an SMTP envelop,
allowing for instance to bypass SPF checks. The patch implies
enforcement of CRLF as a line delimiter as part of the DATA
transaction. We recommend James users to upgrade to non vulnerable
versions.

Postfix through 3.8.5 allows SMTP smuggling unless configured with
smtpd_data_restrictions=reject_unauth_pipelining and
smtpd_discard_ehlo_keywords=chunking (or certain other options that
exist in recent versions). Remote attackers can use a published
exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL
FROM address, allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This
occurs because Postfix supports <LF>.<CR><LF> but some other popular
e-mail servers do not. To prevent attack variants (by always
disallowing <LF> without <CR>), a different solution is required, such
as the smtpd_forbid_bare_newline=yes option with a Postfix minimum
version of 3.5.23, 3.6.13, 3.7.9, 3.8.4, or 3.9.

sendmail through 8.17.2 allows SMTP smuggling in certain
configurations. Remote attackers can use a published exploitation
technique to inject e-mail messages with a spoofed MAIL FROM address,
allowing bypass of an SPF protection mechanism. This occurs because
sendmail supports <LF>.<CR><LF> but some other popular e-mail servers
do not. This is resolved in 8.18 and later versions with 'o' in
srv_features.

published exploitation technique to inject e-mail messages with a
spoofed MAIL FROM address, allowing bypass of an SPF protection
mechanism. This occurs because Exim supports <LF>.<CR><LF> but some

Atril Document Viewer is the default document reader of the MATE
desktop environment for Linux. A path traversal and arbitrary file
write vulnerability exists in versions of Atril prior to 1.26.2. This
vulnerability is capable of writing arbitrary files anywhere on the
filesystem to which the user opening a crafted document has access.
The only limitation is that this vulnerability cannot be exploited to
overwrite existing files, but that doesn't stop an attacker from
achieving Remote Command Execution on the target system. Version
1.26.2 of Atril contains a patch for this vulnerability.

msgpackr is a fast MessagePack NodeJS/JavaScript implementation. Prior

ffcss is a CLI interface to apply and configure Firefox CSS themes.
Prior to 0.2.0, the function `lookupPreprocess()` is meant to apply
some transformations to a string by disabling characters in the regex
`[-_ .]`. However, due to the use of late Unicode normalization of
type NFKD, it is possible to bypass that validation and re-introduce
all the characters in the regex `[-_ .]`. The `lookupPreprocess()` can
be easily bypassed with equivalent Unicode characters like U+FE4D (&#65101;),
which would result in the omitted U+005F (_), for instance. The
`lookupPreprocess()` function is only ever used to search for themes
loosely (case insensitively, while ignoring dashes, underscores and
dots), so the actual security impact is classified as low. This
vulnerability is fixed in 0.2.0. There are no known workarounds.

The [`tj-actions/verify-changed-files`](https://github.com/tj-
actions/verify-changed-files) action allows for command injection in
changed filenames, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code and
potentially leak secrets. The [`verify-changed-
files`](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-files) workflow
returns the list of files changed within a workflow execution. This
could potentially allow filenames that contain special characters such
as `;` which can be used by an attacker to take over the [GitHub
Runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-
runners/about-github-hosted-runners) if the output value is used in a
raw fashion (thus being directly replaced before execution) inside a
`run` block. By running custom commands, an attacker may be able to
steal secrets such as `GITHUB_TOKEN` if triggered on other events than
`pull_request`. This has been patched in versions
[17](https://github.com/tj-actions/verify-changed-
files/releases/tag/v17) and [17.0.0](https://github.com/tj-
actions/verify-changed-files/releases/tag/v17.0.0) by enabling
`safe_output` by default and returning filename paths escaping special
characters for bash environments.

Engrampa is an archive manager for the MATE environment. Engrampa is
found to be vulnerable to a Path Traversal vulnerability that can be
leveraged to achieve full Remote Command Execution (RCE) on the
target. While handling CPIO archives, the Engrampa Archive manager
follows symlink, cpio by default will follow stored symlinks while
extracting and the Archiver will not check the symlink location, which
leads to arbitrary file writes to unintended locations. When the
victim extracts the archive, the attacker can craft a malicious cpio
or ISO archive to achieve RCE on the target system. This vulnerability
was fixed in commit 63d5dfa.

as reading or adding non-public content. As a result, if the user who
authenticated the application is an administrator, confidential
information such as object storage secret keys and SMTP server

codes without permission and leak non-public user information. This is
patched in version [2023.12.1](https://github.com/misskey-

The implementation of PEAP in wpa_supplicant through 2.10 allows
authentication bypass. For a successful attack, wpa_supplicant must be
configured to not verify the network's TLS certificate during Phase 1
authentication, and an eap_peap_decrypt vulnerability can then be
abused to skip Phase 2 authentication. The attack vector is sending an
EAP-TLV Success packet instead of starting Phase 2. This allows an
adversary to impersonate Enterprise Wi-Fi networks.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net: prevent mss overflow in skb_segment() Once again syzbot is able
to crash the kernel in skb_segment() [1] GSO_BY_FRAGS is a forbidden
value, but unfortunately the following computation in skb_segment()
can reach it quite easily : mss = mss * partial_segs; 65535 = 3 * 5 *
17 * 257, so many initial values of mss can lead to a bad final
result. Make sure to limit segmentation so that the new mss value is
smaller than GSO_BY_FRAGS. [1] general protection fault, probably for

f2fs: explicitly null-terminate the xattr list When setting an xattr,
explicitly null-terminate the xattr list. This eliminates the fragile
assumption that the unused xattr space is always zeroed.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
binder: fix use-after-free in shinker's callback The mmap read lock is
used during the shrinker's callback, which means that using alloc->vma
pointer isn't safe as it can race with munmap(). As of commit
dd2283f2605e ("mm: mmap: zap pages with read mmap_sem in munmap") the
mmap lock is downgraded after the vma has been isolated. I was able to
reproduce this issue by manually adding some delays and triggering
page reclaiming through the shrinker's debug sysfs. The following
KASAN report confirms the UAF:

performing instead a vma_lookup() which will fail to find the vma that

better performance than upgrading to a mmap write lock which would
increase contention. Plus, mmap_write_trylock() has been recently
removed anyway.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
uio: Fix use-after-free in uio_open core-1 core-2
-------------------------------------------------------
uio_unregister_device uio_open idev = idr_find()
device_unregister(&idev->dev) put_device(&idev->dev)
uio_device_release get_device(&idev->dev) kfree(idev)
uio_free_minor(minor) uio_release put_device(&idev->dev) kfree(idev)
------------------------------------------------------- In the core-1
uio_unregister_device(), the device_unregister will kfree idev when
the idev->dev kobject ref is 1. But after core-1 device_unregister,
put_device and before doing kfree, the core-2 may get_device. Then: 1.
After core-1 kfree idev, the core-2 will do use-after-free for idev.
2. When core-2 do uio_release and put_device, the idev will be double
freed. To address this issue, we can get idev atomic & inc idev
reference with minor_lock.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
apparmor: avoid crash when parsed profile name is empty When
processing a packed profile in unpack_profile() described like
"profile :ns::samba-dcerpcd /usr/lib*/samba/{,samba/}samba-dcerpcd
{...}" a string ":samba-dcerpcd" is unpacked as a fully-qualified name
and then passed to aa_splitn_fqname(). aa_splitn_fqname() treats
":samba-dcerpcd" as only containing a namespace. Thus it returns NULL
for tmpname, meanwhile tmpns is non-NULL. Later aa_alloc_profile()
crashes as the new profile name is NULL now. general protection fault,

explicit comment "a ns name without a following profile is allowed"
inside. AFAICS, nothing can prevent unpacked "name" to be in form like
":samba-dcerpcd" - it is passed from userspace. Deny the whole profile

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
media: pvrusb2: fix use after free on context disconnection Upon
module load, a kthread is created targeting the
pvr2_context_thread_func function, which may call pvr2_context_destroy
and thus call kfree() on the context object. However, that might
happen before the usb hub_event handler is able to notify the driver.
This patch adds a sanity check before the invalid read reported by
syzbot, within the context disconnection call stack.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
bpf: Defer the free of inner map when necessary When updating or
deleting an inner map in map array or map htab, the map may still be
accessed by non-sleepable program or sleepable program. However
bpf_map_fd_put_ptr() decreases the ref-counter of the inner map
directly through bpf_map_put(), if the ref-counter is the last one
(which is true for most cases), the inner map will be freed by
ops->map_free() in a kworker. But for now, most .map_free() callbacks
don't use synchronize_rcu() or its variants to wait for the elapse of
a RCU grace period, so after the invocation of ops->map_free
completes, the bpf program which is accessing the inner map may incur
use-after-free problem. Fix the free of inner map by invoking
bpf_map_free_deferred() after both one RCU grace period and one tasks
trace RCU grace period if the inner map has been removed from the
outer map before. The deferment is accomplished by using call_rcu() or
call_rcu_tasks_trace() when releasing the last ref-counter of bpf map.
The newly-added rcu_head field in bpf_map shares the same storage
space with work field to reduce the size of bpf_map.

information available at the Link [1], In the normal case, obtain
gluebi->desc in the gluebi_get_device(), and access gluebi->desc in
the gluebi_read(). However, gluebi_get_device() is not executed in
advance in the ftl_add_mtd() process, which leads to NULL pointer
dereference. The solution for the gluebi module is to run jffs2 on the
UBI volume without considering working with ftl or mtdblock [2].
Therefore, this problem can be avoided by preventing gluebi from
creating the mtdblock device after creating mtd partition of the type
MTD_UBIVOLUME.

powerpc/pseries/memhp: Fix access beyond end of drmem array
dlpar_memory_remove_by_index() may access beyond the bounds of the
drmem lmb array when the LMB lookup fails to match an entry with the
given DRC index. When the search fails, the cursor is left pointing to
&drmem_info->lmbs[drmem_info->n_lmbs], which is one element past the
last valid entry in the array. The debug message at the end of the
function then dereferences this pointer: pr_debug("Failed to hot-
remove memory at %llx\n", lmb->base_addr); This was found by
inspection and confirmed with KASAN: pseries-hotplug-mem: Attempting

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
bpf: Fix accesses to uninit stack slots Privileged programs are
supposed to be able to read uninitialized stack memory (ever since
6715df8d5) but, before this patch, these accesses were permitted
inconsistently. In particular, accesses were permitted above
state->allocated_stack, but not below it. In other words, if the stack
was already "large enough", the access was permitted, but otherwise
the access was rejected instead of being allowed to "grow the stack".
This undesired rejection was happening in two places: - in
check_stack_slot_within_bounds() - in check_stack_range_initialized()
This patch arranges for these accesses to be permitted. A bunch of
tests that were relying on the old rejection had to change; all of
them were changed to add also run unprivileged, in which case the old
behavior persists. One tests couldn't be updated - global_func16 -
because it can't run unprivileged for other reasons. This patch also
fixes the tracking of the stack size for variable-offset reads. This
second fix is bundled in the same commit as the first one because
they're inter-related. Before this patch, writes to the stack using
registers containing a variable offset (as opposed to registers with
fixed, known values) were not properly contributing to the function's
needed stack size. As a result, it was possible for a program to
verify, but then to attempt to read out-of-bounds data at runtime
because a too small stack had been allocated for it. Each function
tracks the size of the stack it needs in bpf_subprog_info.stack_depth,
which is maintained by update_stack_depth(). For regular memory
accesses, check_mem_access() was calling update_state_depth() but it
was passing in only the fixed part of the offset register, ignoring
the variable offset. This was incorrect; the minimum possible value of
that register should be used instead. This tracking is now fixed by
centralizing the tracking of stack size in grow_stack_state(), and by
lifting the calls to grow_stack_state() to
check_stack_access_within_bounds() as suggested by Andrii. The code is
now simpler and more convincingly tracks the correct maximum stack
size. check_stack_range_initialized() can now rely on enough stack
having been allocated for the access; this helps with the fix for the
first issue. A few tests were changed to also check the stack depth
computation. The one that fails without this patch is
verifier_var_off:stack_write_priv_vs_unpriv.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
iommu: Don't reserve 0-length IOVA region When the bootloader/firmware
doesn't setup the framebuffers, their address and size are 0 in
"iommu-addresses" property. If IOVA region is reserved with 0 length,
then it ends up corrupting the IOVA rbtree with an entry which has
pfn_hi < pfn_lo. If we intend to use display driver in kernel without
framebuffer then it's causing the display IOMMU mappings to fail as
entire valid IOVA space is reserved when address and length are passed
as 0. An ideal solution would be firmware removing the "iommu-
addresses" property and corresponding "memory-region" if display is
not present. But the kernel should be able to handle this by checking
for size of IOVA region and skipping the IOVA reservation if size is
0. Also, add a warning if firmware is requesting 0-length IOVA region
reservation.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
serial: imx: fix tx statemachine deadlock When using the serial port
as RS485 port, the tx statemachine is used to control the RTS pin to
drive the RS485 transceiver TX_EN pin. When the TTY port is closed in
the middle of a transmission (for instance during userland application
crash), imx_uart_shutdown disables the interface and disables the
Transmission Complete interrupt. afer that, imx_uart_stop_tx bails on
an incomplete transmission, to be retriggered by the TC interrupt.
This interrupt is disabled and therefore the tx statemachine never
transitions out of SEND. The statemachine is in deadlock now, and the
TX_EN remains low, making the interface useless. imx_uart_stop_tx now
checks for incomplete transmission AND whether TC interrupts are
enabled before bailing to be retriggered. This makes sure the state
machine handling is reached, and is properly set to WAIT_AFTER_SEND.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
serial: 8250: omap: Don't skip resource freeing if
pm_runtime_resume_and_get() failed Returning an error code from
.remove() makes the driver core emit the little helpful error message:
remove callback returned a non-zero value. This will be ignored. and
then remove the device anyhow. So all resources that were not freed
are leaked in this case. Skipping serial8250_unregister_port() has the
potential to keep enough of the UART around to trigger a use-after-
free. So replace the error return (and with it the little helpful
error message) by a more useful error message and continue to cleanup.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
block: add check that partition length needs to be aligned with block
size Before calling add partition or resize partition, there is no
check on whether the length is aligned with the logical block size. If
the logical block size of the disk is larger than 512 bytes, then the
partition size maybe not the multiple of the logical block size, and
when the last sector is read, bio_truncate() will adjust the bio size,
resulting in an IO error if the size of the read command is smaller
than the logical block size.If integrity data is supported, this will
also result in a null pointer dereference when calling
bio_integrity_free.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
bpf: fix check for attempt to corrupt spilled pointer When register is
spilled onto a stack as a 1/2/4-byte register, we set
slot_type[BPF_REG_SIZE - 1] (plus potentially few more below it,
depending on actual spill size). So to check if some stack slot has
spilled register we need to consult slot_type[7], not slot_type[0]. To
avoid the need to remember and double-check this in the future, just
use is_spilled_reg() helper.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
efivarfs: force RO when remounting if SetVariable is not supported If
SetVariable at runtime is not supported by the firmware we never
assign a callback for that function. At the same time mount the
efivarfs as RO so no one can call that. However, we never check the
permission flags when someone remounts the filesystem as RW. As a
result this leads to a crash looking like this: $ mount -o remount,rw

strncat() to behave the way that strlcat() does, which uses the size
of the destination buffer as its third argument rather than the length
of the source buffer. The result is that there is no check on the size
of the allocated buffer. Change it to strlcat(). [ bp: Trim compiler

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
class: fix use-after-free in class_register() The lock_class_key is
still registered and can be found in lock_keys_hash hlist after
subsys_private is freed in error handler path.A task who iterate over
the lock_keys_hash later may cause use-after-free.So fix that up and
unregister the lock_class_key before kfree(cp). On our platform, a
driver fails to kset_register because of creating duplicate filename
'/class/xxx'.With Kasan enabled, it prints a invalid-access bug
report. KASAN bug report: BUG: KASAN: invalid-access in

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
drivers/amd/pm: fix a use-after-free in kv_parse_power_table When ps
allocated by kzalloc equals to NULL, kv_parse_power_table frees
adev->pm.dpm.ps that allocated before. However, after the control flow
goes through the following call chains: kv_parse_power_table |->
kv_dpm_init |-> kv_dpm_sw_init |-> kv_dpm_fini The adev->pm.dpm.ps is
used in the for loop of kv_dpm_fini after its first free in
kv_parse_power_table and causes a use-after-free bug.

insist that the mpi_alloc() allocation can fail so add a check to
prevent a NULL dereference. Small allocations like this can't actually

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
thermal: core: Fix NULL pointer dereference in zone registration error
path If device_register() in thermal_zone_device_register_with_trips()
returns an error, the tz variable is set to NULL and subsequently
dereferenced in kfree(tz->tzp). Commit adc8749b150c
("thermal/drivers/core: Use put_device() if device_register() fails")
added the tz = NULL assignment in question to avoid a possible double-
free after dropping the reference to the zone device. However, after
commit 4649620d9404 ("thermal: core: Make
thermal_zone_device_unregister() return after freeing the zone"), that
assignment has become redundant, because dropping the reference to the
zone device does not cause the zone object to be freed any more. Drop
it to address the NULL pointer dereference.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
IB/hfi1: Fix bugs with non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-iovec user SDMA
requests hfi1 user SDMA request processing has two bugs that can cause
data corruption for user SDMA requests that have multiple payload
iovecs where an iovec other than the tail iovec does not run up to the
page boundary for the buffer pointed to by that iovec.a Here are the
specific bugs: 1. user_sdma_txadd() does not use struct
user_sdma_iovec->iov.iov_len. Rather, user_sdma_txadd() will add up to
PAGE_SIZE bytes from iovec to the packet, even if some of those bytes
are past iovec->iov.iov_len and are thus not intended to be in the
packet. 2. user_sdma_txadd() and user_sdma_send_pkts() fail to advance
to the next iovec in user_sdma_request->iovs when the current iovec is
not PAGE_SIZE and does not contain enough data to complete the packet.
The transmitted packet will contain the wrong data from the iovec
pages. This has not been an issue with SDMA packets from hfi1 Verbs or
PSM2 because they only produce iovecs that end short of PAGE_SIZE as
the tail iovec of an SDMA request. Fixing these bugs exposes other
bugs with the SDMA pin cache (struct mmu_rb_handler) that get in way
of supporting user SDMA requests with multiple payload iovecs whose
buffers do not end at PAGE_SIZE. So this commit fixes those issues as
well. Here are the mmu_rb_handler bugs that non-PAGE_SIZE-end multi-
iovec payload user SDMA requests can hit: 1. Overlapping memory ranges
in mmu_rb_handler will result in duplicate pinnings. 2. When extending
an existing mmu_rb_handler entry (struct mmu_rb_node), the mmu_rb code
(1) removes the existing entry under a lock, (2) releases that lock,
pins the new pages, (3) then reacquires the lock to insert the
extended mmu_rb_node. If someone else comes in and inserts an
overlapping entry between (2) and (3), insert in (3) will fail. The
failure path code in this case unpins _all_ pages in either the
original mmu_rb_node or the new mmu_rb_node that was inserted between
(2) and (3). 3. In hfi1_mmu_rb_remove_unless_exact(),
mmu_rb_node->refcount is incremented outside of mmu_rb_handler->lock.
As a result, mmu_rb_node could be evicted by another thread that gets
mmu_rb_handler->lock and checks mmu_rb_node->refcount before
mmu_rb_node->refcount is incremented. 4. Related to #2 above, SDMA
request submission failure path does not check mmu_rb_node->refcount
before freeing mmu_rb_node object. If there are other SDMA requests in
progress whose iovecs have pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb_node(s),
those pointers to the now-freed mmu_rb nodes will be dereferenced when
those SDMA requests complete.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
Input: powermate - fix use-after-free in powermate_config_complete
syzbot has found a use-after-free bug [1] in the powermate driver.
This happens when the device is disconnected, which leads to a memory
free from the powermate_device struct. When an asynchronous control
message completes after the kfree and its callback is invoked, the
lock does not exist anymore and hence the bug. Use usb_kill_urb() on
pm->config to cancel any in-progress requests upon device
disconnection. [1]

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
perf/x86/lbr: Filter vsyscall addresses We found that a panic can
occur when a vsyscall is made while LBR sampling is active. If the
vsyscall is interrupted (NMI) for perf sampling, this call sequence
can occur (most recent at top): __insn_get_emulate_prefix()
insn_get_emulate_prefix() insn_get_prefixes() insn_get_opcode()
decode_branch_type() get_branch_type() intel_pmu_lbr_filter()
intel_pmu_handle_irq() perf_event_nmi_handler() Within
__insn_get_emulate_prefix() at frame 0, a macro is called:
peek_nbyte_next(insn_byte_t, insn, i) Within this macro, this
dereference occurs: (insn)->next_byte Inspecting registers at this
point, the value of the next_byte field is the address of the vsyscall
made, for example the location of the vsyscall version of
gettimeofday() at 0xffffffffff600000. The access to an address in the
vsyscall region will trigger an oops due to an unhandled page fault.
To fix the bug, filtering for vsyscalls can be done when determining
the branch type. This patch will return a "none" branch if a kernel
address if found to lie in the vsyscall region.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
HID: logitech-hidpp: Fix kernel crash on receiver USB disconnect
hidpp_connect_event() has *four* time-of-check vs time-of-use (TOCTOU)
races when it races with itself. hidpp_connect_event() primarily runs
from a workqueue but it also runs on probe() and if a "device-
connected" packet is received by the hw when the thread running
hidpp_connect_event() from probe() is waiting on the hw, then a second
thread running hidpp_connect_event() will be started from the
workqueue. This opens the following races (note the below code is
simplified): 1. Retrieving + printing the protocol (harmless race): if
(!hidpp->protocol_major) { hidpp_root_get_protocol_version()
hidpp->protocol_major = response.rap.params[0]; } We can actually see
this race hit in the dmesg in the abrt output attached to
rhbz#2227968: [ 3064.624215] logitech-hidpp-device
0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected. [ 3064.658184]
logitech-hidpp-device 0003:046D:4071.0049: HID++ 4.5 device connected.
Testing with extra logging added has shown that after this the 2
threads take turn grabbing the hw access mutex (send_mutex) so they
ping-pong through all the other TOCTOU cases managing to hit all of
them: 2. Updating the name to the HIDPP name (harmless race): if
(hidpp->name == hdev->name) { ... hidpp->name = new_name; } 3.
Initializing the power_supply class for the battery (problematic!):
hidpp_initialize_battery() { if (hidpp->battery.ps) return 0;
probe_battery(); /* Blocks, threads take turns executing this */
hidpp->battery.desc.properties = devm_kmemdup(dev,
hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL); hidpp->battery.ps =
devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev, &hidpp->battery.desc,
cfg); } 4. Creating delayed input_device (potentially problematic): if
(hidpp->delayed_input) return; hidpp->delayed_input =
hidpp_allocate_input(hdev); The really big problem here is 3. Hitting
the race leads to the following sequence:
hidpp->battery.desc.properties = devm_kmemdup(dev,
hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL); hidpp->battery.ps =
devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev, &hidpp->battery.desc,
cfg); ... hidpp->battery.desc.properties = devm_kmemdup(dev,
hidpp_battery_props, cnt, GFP_KERNEL); hidpp->battery.ps =
devm_power_supply_register(&hidpp->hid_dev->dev, &hidpp->battery.desc,
cfg); So now we have registered 2 power supplies for the same battery,
which looks a bit weird from userspace's pov but this is not even the
really big problem. Notice how: 1. This is all devm-maganaged 2. The
hidpp->battery.desc struct is shared between the 2 power supplies 3.
hidpp->battery.desc.properties points to the result from the second
devm_kmemdup() This causes a use after free scenario on USB disconnect
of the receiver: 1. The last registered power supply class device gets
unregistered 2. The memory from the last devm_kmemdup() call gets
freed, hidpp->battery.desc.properties now points to freed memory 3.
The first registered power supply class device gets unregistered, this
involves sending a remove uevent to userspace which invokes
power_supply_uevent() to fill the uevent data 4. power_supply_uevent()
uses hidpp->battery.desc.properties which now points to freed memory
leading to backtraces like this one: Sep 22 20:01:35 eric kernel: BUG:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
arm64: errata: Add Cortex-A520 speculative unprivileged load
workaround Implement the workaround for ARM Cortex-A520 erratum
2966298. On an affected Cortex-A520 core, a speculatively executed
unprivileged load might leak data from a privileged load via a cache
side channel. The issue only exists for loads within a translation
regime with the same translation (e.g. same ASID and VMID). Therefore,
the issue only affects the return to EL0. The workaround is to execute
a TLBI before returning to EL0 after all loads of privileged data. A
non-shareable TLBI to any address is sufficient. The workaround isn't
necessary if page table isolation (KPTI) is enabled, but for
simplicity it will be. Page table isolation should normally be
disabled for Cortex-A520 as it supports the CSV3 feature and the E0PD
feature (used when KASLR is enabled).

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
mctp: perform route lookups under a RCU read-side lock Our current
route lookups (mctp_route_lookup and mctp_route_lookup_null) traverse
the net's route list without the RCU read lock held. This means the
route lookup is subject to preemption, resulting in an potential grace
period expiry, and so an eventual kfree() while we still have the
route pointer. Add the proper read-side critical section locks around
the route lookups, preventing premption and a possible parallel kfree.
The remaining net->mctp.routes accesses are already under a
rcu_read_lock, or protected by the RTNL for updates. Based on an
analysis from Sili Luo <rootlab@huawei.com>, where introducing a delay
in the route lookup could cause a UAF on simultaneous sendmsg() and
route deletion.

Note that since 6.6-rc1 the arm_smmu_mm_invalidate_range above is
renamed to "arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs", yet the
problem remains. The commit 06ff87bae8d3 ("arm64: mm: remove unused
functions and variable protoypes") fixed a similar lockup on the CPU
MMU side. Yet, it can occur to SMMU too, since
arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs() is called typically next
to MMU tlb flush function, e.g. tlb_flush_mmu_tlbonly { tlb_flush {
__flush_tlb_range { // check MAX_TLBI_OPS } }
mmu_notifier_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs {
arm_smmu_mm_arch_invalidate_secondary_tlbs { // does not check
MAX_TLBI_OPS } } } Clone a CMDQ_MAX_TLBI_OPS from the MAX_TLBI_OPS in
tlbflush.h, since in an SVA case SMMU uses the CPU page table, so it
makes sense to align with the tlbflush code. Then, replace per-page
TLBI commands with a single per-asid TLBI command, if the request size
hits this threshold.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
drm: Don't unref the same fb many times by mistake due to deadlock
handling If we get a deadlock after the fb lookup in
drm_mode_page_flip_ioctl() we proceed to unref the fb and then retry
the whole thing from the top. But we forget to reset the fb pointer
back to NULL, and so if we then get another error during the retry,
before the fb lookup, we proceed the unref the same fb again without
having gotten another reference. The end result is that the fb will
(eventually) end up being freed while it's still in use. Reset fb to
NULL once we've unreffed it to avoid doing it again until we've done
another fb lookup. This turned out to be pretty easy to hit on a DG2
when doing async flips (and CONFIG_DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH=y). The
first symptom I saw that drm_closefb() simply got stuck in a busy loop
while walking the framebuffer list. Fortunately I was able to convince
it to oops instead, and from there it was easier to track down the
culprit.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net/mlx5e: Fix peer flow lists handling The cited change refactored
mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peer_flow() to only clear DUP flag when list of peer
flows has become empty. However, if any concurrent user holds a
reference to a peer flow (for example, the neighbor update workqueue
task is updating peer flow's parent encap entry concurrently), then
the flow will not be removed from the peer list and, consecutively,
DUP flag will remain set. Since mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peers_flow() calls
mlx5e_tc_del_fdb_peer_flow() for every possible peer index the
algorithm will try to remove the flow from eswitch instances that it
has never peered with causing either NULL pointer dereference when
trying to remove the flow peer list head of peer_index that was never
initialized or a warning if the list debug config is enabled[0]. Fix
the issue by always removing the peer flow from the list even when not
releasing the last reference to it. [0]: [ 3102.985806] ------------[

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
serial: sc16is7xx: convert from _raw_ to _noinc_ regmap functions for
FIFO The SC16IS7XX IC supports a burst mode to access the FIFOs where
the initial register address is sent ($00), followed by all the FIFO
data without having to resend the register address each time. In this
mode, the IC doesn't increment the register address for each R/W byte.
The regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() are functions which can
perform IO over multiple registers. They are currently used to
read/write from/to the FIFO, and although they operate correctly in
this burst mode on the SPI bus, they would corrupt the regmap cache if
it was not disabled manually. The reason is that when the R/W size is
more than 1 byte, these functions assume that the register address is
incremented and handle the cache accordingly. Convert FIFO R/W
functions to use the regmap _noinc_ versions in order to remove the
manual cache control which was a workaround when using the _raw_
versions. FIFO registers are properly declared as volatile so cache
will not be used/updated for FIFO accesses.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
mm/sparsemem: fix race in accessing memory_section->usage The below
race is observed on a PFN which falls into the device memory region
with the system memory configuration where PFN's are such that
[ZONE_NORMAL ZONE_DEVICE ZONE_NORMAL]. Since normal zone start and end
pfn contains the device memory PFN's as well, the compaction triggered
will try on the device memory PFN's too though they end up in
NOP(because pfn_to_online_page() returns NULL for ZONE_DEVICE memory
sections). When from other core, the section mappings are being
removed for the ZONE_DEVICE region, that the PFN in question belongs
to, on which compaction is currently being operated is resulting into
the kernel crash with CONFIG_SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled. The crash logs
can be seen at [1]. compact_zone() memunmap_pages -------------
--------------- __pageblock_pfn_to_page ...... (a)pfn_valid():
valid_section()//return true (b)__remove_pages()->
sparse_remove_section()-> section_deactivate(): [Free the array
ms->usage and set ms->usage = NULL] pfn_section_valid() [Access
ms->usage which is NULL] NOTE: From the above it can be said that the
race is reduced to between the pfn_valid()/pfn_section_valid() and the
section deactivate with SPASEMEM_VMEMAP enabled. The commit
b943f045a9af("mm/sparse: fix kernel crash with pfn_section_valid
check") tried to address the same problem by clearing the
SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP with the expectation of valid_section() returns
false thus ms->usage is not accessed. Fix this issue by the below
steps: a) Clear SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP before freeing the ->usage. b) RCU
protected read side critical section will either return NULL when
SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP is cleared or can successfully access ->usage. c)
Free the ->usage with kfree_rcu() and set ms->usage = NULL. No attempt
will be made to access ->usage after this as the SECTION_HAS_MEM_MAP
is cleared thus valid_section() return false. Thanks to David/Pavan

memory_block_offline+0x44/0xf4 memory_subsys_offline+0x3c/0x70
device_offline+0xf0/0x120 ...... After analyzing the vmcore, I found
this issue is caused by page migration. The scenario is that, one
thread is doing page migration, and we will use the target page's
->mapping field to save 'anon_vma' pointer between page unmap and page
move, and now the target page is locked and refcount is 1. Currently,
there is another stress-ng thread performing memory hotplug,
attempting to offline the target page that is being migrated. It
discovers that the refcount of this target page is 1, preventing the
offline operation, thus proceeding to dump the page. However,
page_mapping() of the target page may return an incorrect file mapping
to crash the system in dump_mapping(), since the target page->mapping
only saves 'anon_vma' pointer without setting PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag.
There are seveval ways to fix this issue: (1) Setting the
PAGE_MAPPING_ANON flag for target page's ->mapping when saving
'anon_vma', but this can confuse PageAnon() for PFN walkers, since the
target page has not built mappings yet. (2) Getting the page lock to
call page_mapping() in __dump_page() to avoid crashing the system,
however, there are still some PFN walkers that call page_mapping()
without holding the page lock, such as compaction. (3) Using target
page->private field to save the 'anon_vma' pointer and 2 bits page
state, just as page->mapping records an anonymous page, which can
remove the page_mapping() impact for PFN walkers and also seems a
simple way. So I choose option 3 to fix this issue, and this can also
fix other potential issues for PFN walkers, such as compaction.

descriptor, which will call mtk_jpeg_release, it will have a similar
sequence. Fix this bug by starting timeout worker only if started
jpegdec worker successfully. Then v4l2_m2m_job_finish will only be
called in either mtk_jpeg_job_timeout_work or mtk_jpeg_dec_device_run.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
dmaengine: fix NULL pointer in channel unregistration function
__dma_async_device_channel_register() can fail. In case of failure,
chan->local is freed (with free_percpu()), and chan->local is
nullified. When dma_async_device_unregister() is called (because of
managed API or intentionally by DMA controller driver), channels are
unconditionally unregistered, leading to this NULL pointer: [

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
bus: mhi: host: Add alignment check for event ring read pointer Though
we do check the event ring read pointer by "is_valid_ring_ptr" to make
sure it is in the buffer range, but there is another risk the pointer
may be not aligned. Since we are expecting event ring elements are 128
bits(struct mhi_ring_element) aligned, an unaligned read pointer could
lead to multiple issues like DoS or ring buffer memory corruption. So
add a alignment check for event ring read pointer.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
erofs: fix lz4 inplace decompression Currently EROFS can map another
compressed buffer for inplace decompression, that was used to handle
the cases that some pages of compressed data are actually not in-place
I/O. However, like most simple LZ77 algorithms, LZ4 expects the
compressed data is arranged at the end of the decompressed buffer and
it explicitly uses memmove() to handle overlapping:
__________________________________________________________ |_
direction of decompression --> ____ |_ compressed data _| Although
EROFS arranges compressed data like this, it typically maps two
individual virtual buffers so the relative order is uncertain.
Previously, it was hardly observed since LZ4 only uses memmove() for
short overlapped literals and x86/arm64 memmove implementations seem
to completely cover it up and they don't have this issue. Juhyung
reported that EROFS data corruption can be found on a new Intel x86
processor. After some analysis, it seems that recent x86 processors
with the new FSRM feature expose this issue with "rep movsb". Let's
strictly use the decompressed buffer for lz4 inplace decompression for
now. Later, as an useful improvement, we could try to tie up these two
buffers together in the correct order.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
PM: sleep: Fix possible deadlocks in core system-wide PM code It is
reported that in low-memory situations the system-wide resume core
code deadlocks, because async_schedule_dev() executes its argument
function synchronously if it cannot allocate memory (and not only in
that case) and that function attempts to acquire a mutex that is
already held. Executing the argument function synchronously from
within dpm_async_fn() may also be problematic for ordering reasons (it
may cause a consumer device's resume callback to be invoked before a
requisite supplier device's one, for example). Address this by
changing the code in question to use async_schedule_dev_nocall() for
scheduling the asynchronous execution of device suspend and resume
functions and to directly run them synchronously if
async_schedule_dev_nocall() returns false.

code jumps out-of-line to do the flush, and then intends to jump back

elsewhere. Fix it by adding named local labels in the correct

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ring-buffer: Do not attempt to read past "commit" When iterating over
the ring buffer while the ring buffer is active, the writer can
corrupt the reader. There's barriers to help detect this and handle
it, but that code missed the case where the last event was at the very
end of the page and has only 4 bytes left. The checks to detect the
corruption by the writer to reads needs to see the length of the
event. If the length in the first 4 bytes is zero then the length is
stored in the second 4 bytes. But if the writer is in the process of
updating that code, there's a small window where the length in the
first 4 bytes could be zero even though the length is only 4 bytes.
That will cause rb_event_length() to read the next 4 bytes which could
happen to be off the allocated page. To protect against this, fail
immediately if the next event pointer is less than 8 bytes from the
end of the commit (last byte of data), as all events must be a minimum
of 8 bytes anyway.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net: nfc: fix races in nfc_llcp_sock_get() and nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn()
Sili Luo reported a race in nfc_llcp_sock_get(), leading to UAF.
Getting a reference on the socket found in a lookup while holding a
lock should happen before releasing the lock. nfc_llcp_sock_get_sn()
has a similar problem. Finally nfc_llcp_recv_snl() needs to make sure
the socket found by nfc_llcp_sock_from_sn() does not disappear.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
tee: amdtee: fix use-after-free vulnerability in amdtee_close_session
There is a potential race condition in amdtee_close_session that may
cause use-after-free in amdtee_open_session. For instance, if a
session has refcount == 1, and one thread tries to free this session
via: kref_put(&sess->refcount, destroy_session); the reference count
will get decremented, and the next step would be to call
destroy_session(). However, if in another thread,
amdtee_open_session() is called before destroy_session() has completed
execution, alloc_session() may return 'sess' that will be freed up
later in destroy_session() leading to use-after-free in
amdtee_open_session. To fix this issue, treat decrement of
sess->refcount and removal of 'sess' from session list in
destroy_session() as a critical section, so that it is executed
atomically.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
x86/alternatives: Disable KASAN in apply_alternatives() Fei has
reported that KASAN triggers during apply_alternatives() on a 5-level
paging machine: BUG: KASAN: out-of-bounds in rcu_is_watching() Read of
size 4 at addr ff110003ee6419a0 by task swapper/0/0 ... __asan_load4()
rcu_is_watching() trace_hardirqs_on() text_poke_early()
apply_alternatives() ... On machines with 5-level paging,
cpu_feature_enabled(X86_FEATURE_LA57) gets patched. It includes KASAN
code, where KASAN_SHADOW_START depends on __VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT, which
is defined with cpu_feature_enabled(). KASAN gets confused when
apply_alternatives() patches the KASAN_SHADOW_START users. A test
patch that makes KASAN_SHADOW_START static, by replacing
__VIRTUAL_MASK_SHIFT with 56, works around the issue. Fix it for real
by disabling KASAN while the kernel is patching alternatives. [ mingo:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
phy: lynx-28g: serialize concurrent phy_set_mode_ext() calls to shared
registers The protocol converter configuration registers PCC8, PCCC,
PCCD (implemented by the driver), as well as others, control protocol
converters from multiple lanes (each represented as a different struct
phy). So, if there are simultaneous calls to phy_set_mode_ext() to
lanes sharing the same PCC register (either for the "old" or for the
"new" protocol), corruption of the values programmed to hardware is
possible, because lynx_28g_rmw() has no locking. Add a spinlock in the
struct lynx_28g_priv shared by all lanes, and take the global spinlock
from the phy_ops :: set_mode() implementation. There are no other
callers which modify PCC registers.

57fe4bb1 260002cd The reason is early memblock_reserve() in
memblock_init() set node id to MAX_NUMNODES, making NODE_DATA(nid) a
NULL dereference in the call chain reserve_bootmem_region() ->
init_reserved_page(). After memblock_init(), those late calls of
memblock_reserve() operate on subregions of memblock .memory regions.
As a result, these reserved regions will be set to the correct node at
the first iteration of memmap_init_reserved_pages(). So set all
reserved memblocks on Node#0 at initialization can avoid this panic.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ravb: Fix use-after-free issue in ravb_tx_timeout_work() The
ravb_stop() should call cancel_work_sync(). Otherwise,
ravb_tx_timeout_work() is possible to use the freed priv after
ravb_remove() was called like below: CPU0 CPU1 ravb_tx_timeout()
ravb_remove() unregister_netdev() free_netdev(ndev) // free priv
ravb_tx_timeout_work() // use priv unregister_netdev() will call
.ndo_stop() so that ravb_stop() is called. And, after phy_stop() is
called, netif_carrier_off() is also called. So that .ndo_tx_timeout()
will not be called after phy_stop().

The Grid Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
modification of data and loss of data due to a missing capability
check on the 'grid_plus_save_layout_callback' and
'grid_plus_delete_callback' functions in versions up to, and
including, 1.3.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with subscriber privileges or above, to add, update or delete grid
layout.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ieee802154: ca8210: Fix a potential UAF in ca8210_probe If
of_clk_add_provider() fails in ca8210_register_ext_clock(), it calls
clk_unregister() to release priv->clk and returns an error. However,
the caller ca8210_probe() then calls ca8210_remove(), where priv->clk
is freed again in ca8210_unregister_ext_clock(). In this case, a use-
after-free may happen in the second time we call clk_unregister(). Fix
this by removing the first clk_unregister(). Also, priv->clk could be
an error code on failure of clk_register_fixed_rate(). Use
IS_ERR_OR_NULL to catch this case in ca8210_unregister_ext_clock().

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
spi: sun6i: reduce DMA RX transfer width to single byte Through
empirical testing it has been determined that sometimes RX SPI
transfers with DMA enabled return corrupted data. This is down to
single or even multiple bytes lost during DMA transfer from SPI
peripheral to memory. It seems the RX FIFO within the SPI peripheral
can become confused when performing bus read accesses wider than a
single byte to it during an active SPI transfer. This patch reduces
the width of individual DMA read accesses to the RX FIFO to a single
byte to mitigate that issue.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
RDMA/siw: Fix connection failure handling In case immediate MPA
request processing fails, the newly created endpoint unlinks the
listening endpoint and is ready to be dropped. This special case was
not handled correctly by the code handling the later TCP socket close,
causing a NULL dereference crash in siw_cm_work_handler() when
dereferencing a NULL listener. We now also cancel the useless MPA
timeout, if immediate MPA request processing fails. This patch
furthermore simplifies MPA processing in general: Scheduling a useless
TCP socket read in sk_data_ready() upcall is now surpressed, if the
socket is already moved out of TCP_ESTABLISHED state.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
RDMA/srp: Do not call scsi_done() from srp_abort() After
scmd_eh_abort_handler() has called the SCSI LLD eh_abort_handler
callback, it performs one of the following actions: * Call
scsi_queue_insert(). * Call scsi_finish_command(). * Call
scsi_eh_scmd_add(). Hence, SCSI abort handlers must not call
scsi_done(). Otherwise all the above actions would trigger a use-

the srp_free_req() call before returning SUCCESS because we may not
see the command again if SUCCESS is returned.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
spi: sun6i: fix race between DMA RX transfer completion and RX FIFO
drain Previously the transfer complete IRQ immediately drained to RX
FIFO to read any data remaining in FIFO to the RX buffer. This
behaviour is correct when dealing with SPI in interrupt mode. However
in DMA mode the transfer complete interrupt still fires as soon as all
bytes to be transferred have been stored in the FIFO. At that point
data in the FIFO still needs to be picked up by the DMA engine. Thus
the drain procedure and DMA engine end up racing to read from RX FIFO,
corrupting any data read. Additionally the RX buffer pointer is never
adjusted according to DMA progress in DMA mode, thus calling the RX
FIFO drain procedure in DMA mode is a bug. Fix corruptions in DMA RX
mode by draining RX FIFO only in interrupt mode. Also wait for
completion of RX DMA when in DMA mode before returning to ensure all
data has been copied to the supplied memory buffer.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
HID: intel-ish-hid: ipc: Disable and reenable ACPI GPE bit The EHL
(Elkhart Lake) based platforms provide a OOB (Out of band) service,
which allows to wakup device when the system is in S5 (Soft-Off
state). This OOB service can be enabled/disabled from BIOS settings.
When enabled, the ISH device gets PME wake capability. To enable PME
wakeup, driver also needs to enable ACPI GPE bit. On resume, BIOS will
clear the wakeup bit. So driver need to re-enable it in resume
function to keep the next wakeup capability. But this BIOS clearing of
wakeup bit doesn't decrement internal OS GPE reference count, so this
reenabling on every resume will cause reference count to overflow. So
first disable and reenable ACPI GPE bit using acpi_disable_gpe().

The FareHarbor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
Scripting via shortcodes in versions up to, and including, 3.6.7 due
to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping on user
supplied attributes. This makes it possible for authenticated
attackers with contributor-level and above permissions to inject
arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user
accesses an injected page.

platform/x86: think-lmi: Fix reference leak If a duplicate attribute
is found using kset_find_obj(), a reference to that attribute is
returned which needs to be disposed accordingly using kobject_put().
Move the setting name validation into a separate function to allow for
this change without having to duplicate the cleanup code for this
setting. As a side note, a very similar bug was fixed in commit
7295a996fdab ("platform/x86: dell-sysman: Fix reference leak"), so it
seems that the bug was copied from that driver. Compile-tested only.

the call-chain, that the egress socket (s2) is a TCP socket. However
in commit 122e6c79efe1 ("sock_map: Update sock type checks for UDP")
we have enabled redirects to non-TCP sockets. This was done for the
sake of BPF sk_skb programs. There was no indention to support sk_msg
send-to-egress use case. As a result, attempts to send-to-egress
through a non-TCP socket lead to a crash due to invalid downcast from
sock to tcp_sock: BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ipv4, ipv6: Fix handling of transhdrlen in __ip{,6}_append_data()
Including the transhdrlen in length is a problem when the packet is
partially filled (e.g. something like send(MSG_MORE) happened
previously) when appending to an IPv4 or IPv6 packet as we don't want
to repeat the transport header or account for it twice. This can
happen under some circumstances, such as splicing into an L2TP socket.
The symptom observed is a warning in __ip6_append_data(): WARNING:
CPU: 1 PID: 5042 at net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800
__ip6_append_data.isra.0+0x1be8/0x47f0 net/ipv6/ip6_output.c:1800 that
occurs when MSG_SPLICE_PAGES is used to append more data to an already
partially occupied skbuff. The warning occurs when 'copy' is larger
than the amount of data in the message iterator. This is because the
requested length includes the transport header length when it
shouldn't. This can be triggered by, for example: sfd =
socket(AF_INET6, SOCK_DGRAM, IPPROTO_L2TP); bind(sfd, ...); // ::1
connect(sfd, ...); // ::1 port 7 send(sfd, buffer, 4100, MSG_MORE);
sendfile(sfd, dfd, NULL, 1024); Fix this by only adding transhdrlen
into the length if the write queue is empty in l2tp_ip6_sendmsg(),
analogously to how UDP does things. l2tp_ip_sendmsg() looks like it
won't suffer from this problem as it builds the UDP packet itself.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
wifi: mac80211: fix potential key use-after-free When
ieee80211_key_link() is called by ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add() but
returns 0 due to KRACK protection (identical key reinstall),
ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add() will still return a pointer into the key, in
a potential use-after-free. This normally doesn't happen since it's
only called by iwlwifi in case of WoWLAN rekey offload which has its
own KRACK protection, but still better to fix, do that by returning an
error code and converting that to success on the cfg80211 boundary
only, leaving the error for bad callers of ieee80211_gtk_rekey_add().

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
wifi: iwlwifi: mvm: Fix a memory corruption issue A few lines above,
space is kzalloc()'ed for: sizeof(struct iwl_nvm_data) + sizeof(struct
ieee80211_channel) + sizeof(struct ieee80211_rate) 'mvm->nvm_data' is
a 'struct iwl_nvm_data', so it is fine. At the end of this structure,
there is the 'channels' flex array. Each element is of type 'struct
ieee80211_channel'. So only 1 element is allocated in this array. When
doing: mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].channels = mvm->nvm_data->channels; We
point at the first element of the 'channels' flex array. So this is
fine. However, when doing: mvm->nvm_data->bands[0].bitrates = (void
*)((u8 *)mvm->nvm_data->channels + 1); because of the "(u8 *)" cast,
we add only 1 to the address of the beginning of the flex array. It is
likely that we want point at the 'struct ieee80211_rate' allocated
just after. Remove the spurious casting so that the pointer arithmetic
works as expected.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
iommu/vt-d: Avoid memory allocation in iommu_suspend() The
iommu_suspend() syscore suspend callback is invoked with IRQ disabled.
Allocating memory with the GFP_KERNEL flag may re-enable IRQs during
the suspend callback, which can cause intermittent suspend/hibernation
problems with the following kernel traces: Calling

In certain scenarios, Drupal's JSON:API module will output error
backtraces. With some configurations, this may cause sensitive
information to be cached and made available to anonymous users,
leading to privilege escalation. This vulnerability only affects sites
with the JSON:API module enabled, and can be mitigated by uninstalling
JSON:API. The core REST and contributed GraphQL modules are not
affected.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

damon_do_test_apply_three_regions() When
CONFIG_DAMON_VADDR_KUNIT_TEST=y and making CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK=y and
CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_AUTO_SCAN=y, the below memory leak is detected.
Since commit 9f86d624292c ("mm/damon/vaddr-test: remove unnecessary
variables"), the damon_destroy_ctx() is removed, but still call
damon_new_target() and damon_new_region(), the damon_region which is
allocated by kmem_cache_alloc() in damon_new_region() and the
damon_target which is allocated by kmalloc in damon_new_target() are
not freed. And the damon_region which is allocated in
damon_new_region() in damon_set_regions() is also not freed. So use
damon_destroy_target to free all the damon_regions and damon_target.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
mm/slab_common: fix slab_caches list corruption after
kmem_cache_destroy() After the commit in Fixes:, if a module that
created a slab cache does not release all of its allocated objects
before destroying the cache (at rmmod time), we might end up releasing
the kmem_cache object without removing it from the slab_caches list
thus corrupting the list as kmem_cache_destroy() ignores the return
value from shutdown_cache(), which in turn never removes the
kmem_cache object from slabs_list in case __kmem_cache_shutdown()
fails to release all of the cache's slabs. This is easily observable
on a kernel built with CONFIG_DEBUG_LIST=y as after that ill release
the system will immediately trip on list_add, or list_del, assertions
similar to the one shown below as soon as another kmem_cache gets
created, or destroyed: [ 1041.213632] list_del corruption. next->prev

9b9c8195f3f0d74a826077fc1c01b9ee74907239. The commit above is reverted
as it did not solve the original issue. gsm_cleanup_mux() tries to
free up the virtual ttys by calling gsm_dlci_release() for each
available DLCI. There, dlci_put() is called to decrease the reference
counter for the DLCI via tty_port_put() which finally calls
gsm_dlci_free(). This already clears the pointer which is being
checked in gsm_cleanup_mux() before calling gsm_dlci_release().
Therefore, it is not necessary to clear this pointer in
gsm_cleanup_mux() as done in the reverted commit. The commit
introduces a null pointer dereference: <TASK> ? __die+0x1f/0x70 ?

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
nilfs2: fix potential use after free in
nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data() In nilfs_gccache_submit_read_data(),
brelse(bh) is called to drop the reference count of bh when the call
to nilfs_dat_translate() fails. If the reference count hits 0 and its
owner page gets unlocked, bh may be freed. However, bh->b_page is
dereferenced to put the page after that, which may result in a use-
after-free bug. This patch moves the release operation after unlocking
and putting the page. NOTE: The function in question is only called in
GC, and in combination with current userland tools, address
translation using DAT does not occur in that function, so the code
path that causes this issue will not be executed. However, it is

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
serial: 8250_port: Check IRQ data before use In case the leaf driver
wants to use IRQ polling (irq = 0) and IIR register shows that an
interrupt happened in the 8250 hardware the IRQ data can be NULL. In
such a case we need to skip the wake event as we came to this path
from the timer interrupt and quite likely system is already awake.
Without this fix we have got an Oops: serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
x86/sgx: Resolves SECS reclaim vs. page fault for EAUG race The SGX
EPC reclaimer (ksgxd) may reclaim the SECS EPC page for an enclave and
set secs.epc_page to NULL. The SECS page is used for EAUG and ELDU in
the SGX page fault handler. However, the NULL check for secs.epc_page
is only done for ELDU, not EAUG before being used. Fix this by doing
the same NULL check and reloading of the SECS page as needed for both
EAUG and ELDU. The SECS page holds global enclave metadata. It can
only be reclaimed when there are no other enclave pages remaining. At
that point, virtually nothing can be done with the enclave until the
SECS page is paged back in. An enclave can not run nor generate page
faults without a resident SECS page. But it is still possible for a
#PF for a non-SECS page to race with paging out the SECS page: when
the last resident non-SECS page A triggers a #PF in a non-resident
page B, and then page A and the SECS both are paged out before the #PF
on B is handled. Hitting this bug requires that race triggered with a
#PF for EAUG. Following is a trace when it happens. BUG: kernel NULL

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
btrfs: remove BUG() after failure to insert delayed dir index item
Instead of calling BUG() when we fail to insert a delayed dir index
item into the delayed node's tree, we can just release all the
resources we have allocated/acquired before and return the error to
the caller. This is fine because all existing call chains undo
anything they have done before calling
btrfs_insert_delayed_dir_index() or BUG_ON (when creating pending
snapshots in the transaction commit path). So remove the BUG() call
and do proper error handling. This relates to a syzbot report linked
below, but does not fix it because it only prevents hitting a BUG(),
it does not fix the issue where somehow we attempt to use twice the
same index number for different index items.

incorrect and will trigger null-ptr-deref for vlan->real_dev in
vlan_dev_hard_header() because team device is not a vlan device. Cache
eth_header_ops in team_setup(), then assign cached header_ops to
header_ops of team net device when its type is changed from non-ether
to ether to fix the bug.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
x86/mm, kexec, ima: Use memblock_free_late() from
ima_free_kexec_buffer() The code calling ima_free_kexec_buffer() runs
long after the memblock allocator has already been torn down,
potentially resulting in a use after free in memblock_isolate_range().
With KASAN or KFENCE, this use after free will result in a BUG from
the idle task, and a subsequent kernel panic. Switch
ima_free_kexec_buffer() over to memblock_free_late() to avoid that
bug.

net/core: Fix ETH_P_1588 flow dissector When a PTP ethernet raw frame
with a size of more than 256 bytes followed by a 0xff pattern is sent
to __skb_flow_dissect, nhoff value calculation is wrong. For example:
hdr->message_length takes the wrong value (0xffff) and it does not
replicate real header length. In this case, 'nhoff' value was
overridden and the PTP header was badly dissected. This leads to a
kernel crash. net/core: flow_dissector net/core flow dissector nhoff =

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
netfilter: nf_tables: fix memleak when more than 255 elements expired
When more than 255 elements expired we're supposed to switch to a new
gc container structure. This never happens: u8 type will wrap before
reaching the boundary and nft_trans_gc_space() always returns true.
This means we recycle the initial gc container structure and lose
track of the elements that came before. While at it, don't deref 'gc'
after we've passed it to call_rcu.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
netfs: Only call folio_start_fscache() one time for each folio If a
network filesystem using netfs implements a clamp_length() function,
it can set subrequest lengths smaller than a page size. When we loop
through the folios in netfs_rreq_unlock_folios() to set any folios to
be written back, we need to make sure we only call
folio_start_fscache() once for each folio. Otherwise, this simple
testcase: mount -o fsc,rsize=1024,wsize=1024 127.0.0.1:/export

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
spmi: mediatek: Fix UAF on device remove The pmif driver data that
contains the clocks is allocated along with spmi_controller. On device
remove, spmi_controller will be freed first, and then devres ,
including the clocks, will be cleanup. This leads to UAF because
putting the clocks will access the clocks in the pmif driver data,
which is already freed along with spmi_controller. This can be
reproduced by enabling DEBUG_TEST_DRIVER_REMOVE and building the
kernel with KASAN. Fix the UAF issue by using unmanaged clk_bulk_get()
and putting the clocks before freeing spmi_controller.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
IB/ipoib: Fix mcast list locking Releasing the `priv->lock` while
iterating the `priv->multicast_list` in `ipoib_mcast_join_task()`
opens a window for `ipoib_mcast_dev_flush()` to remove the items while
in the middle of iteration. If the mcast is removed while the lock was
dropped, the for loop spins forever resulting in a hard lockup (as was
reported on RHEL 4.18.0-372.75.1.el8_6 kernel): Task A (kworker/u72:2
below) | Task B (kworker/u72:0 below) --------------------------------

lock held and changing to GFP_ATOMIC to prevent eventual sleeps.
Unfortunately we could not reproduce the lockup and confirm this fix
but based on the code review I think this fix should address such
lockups. crash> bc 31 PID: 747 TASK: ff1c6a1a007e8000 CPU: 31 COMMAND:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
media: rkisp1: Fix IRQ disable race issue In rkisp1_isp_stop() and
rkisp1_csi_disable() the driver masks the interrupts and then
apparently assumes that the interrupt handler won't be running, and
proceeds in the stop procedure. This is not the case, as the interrupt
handler can already be running, which would lead to the ISP being
disabled while the interrupt handler handling a captured frame. This
brings up two issues: 1) the ISP could be powered off while the
interrupt handler is still running and accessing registers, leading to
board lockup, and 2) the interrupt handler code and the code that
disables the streaming might do things that conflict. It is not clear
to me if 2) causes a real issue, but 1) can be seen with a suitable
delay (or printk in my case) in the interrupt handler, leading to
board lockup.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
sysctl: Fix out of bounds access for empty sysctl registers When
registering tables to the sysctl subsystem there is a check to see if
header is a permanently empty directory (used for mounts). This check
evaluates the first element of the ctl_table. This results in an out
of bounds evaluation when registering empty directories. The function
register_sysctl_mount_point now passes a ctl_table of size 1 instead
of size 0. It now relies solely on the type to identify a permanently
empty register. Make sure that the ctl_table has at least one element
before testing for permanent emptiness.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
KVM: s390: fix setting of fpc register kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_fpu()
allows to set the floating point control (fpc) register of a guest
cpu. The new value is tested for validity by temporarily loading it
into the fpc register. This may lead to corruption of the fpc register
of the host process: if an interrupt happens while the value is
temporarily loaded into the fpc register, and within interrupt context
floating point or vector registers are used, the current fp/vx
registers are saved with save_fpu_regs() assuming they belong to user
space and will be loaded into fp/vx registers when returning to user
space. test_fp_ctl() restores the original user space / host process
fpc register value, however it will be discarded, when returning to
user space. In result the host process will incorrectly continue to
run with the value that was supposed to be used for a guest cpu. Fix
this by simply removing the test. There is another test right before
the SIE context is entered which will handles invalid values. This
results in a change of behaviour: invalid values will now be accepted
instead of that the ioctl fails with -EINVAL. This seems to be
acceptable, given that this interface is most likely not used anymore,
and this is in addition the same behaviour implemented with the memory
mapped interface (replace invalid values with zero) - see sync_regs()
in kvm-s390.c.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
s390/ptrace: handle setting of fpc register correctly If the content
of the floating point control (fpc) register of a traced process is
modified with the ptrace interface the new value is tested for
validity by temporarily loading it into the fpc register. This may
lead to corruption of the fpc register of the tracing process: if an
interrupt happens while the value is temporarily loaded into the fpc
register, and within interrupt context floating point or vector
registers are used, the current fp/vx registers are saved with
save_fpu_regs() assuming they belong to user space and will be loaded
into fp/vx registers when returning to user space. test_fp_ctl()
restores the original user space fpc register value, however it will
be discarded, when returning to user space. In result the tracer will
incorrectly continue to run with the value that was supposed to be
used for the traced process. Fix this by saving fpu register contents
with save_fpu_regs() before using test_fp_ctl().

The issue is caused when the value of fsi becomes less than -1. The
check to break the loop when fsi value becomes -1 is present but
syzbot was able to produce value less than -1 which cause the error.
This patch simply add the change for the values less than 0. The patch
is tested via syzbot.

Rebooting in 86400 seconds.. The issue is caused when the value of lp

Adding a simple check solves this issue. Dave: As the function returns
a void, good error handling would require a more intrusive code
reorganization, so I modified Osama's patch at use WARN_ON_ONCE for
lack of a cleaner option. The patch is tested via syzbot.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
powerpc/lib: Validate size for vector operations Some of the fp/vmx
code in sstep.c assume a certain maximum size for the instructions
being emulated. The size of those operations however is determined
separately in analyse_instr(). Add a check to validate the assumption
on the maximum size of the operations, so as to prevent any unintended
kernel stack corruption.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
firmware: arm_scmi: Check mailbox/SMT channel for consistency On
reception of a completion interrupt the shared memory area is accessed
to retrieve the message header at first and then, if the message
sequence number identifies a transaction which is still pending, the
related payload is fetched too. When an SCMI command times out the
channel ownership remains with the platform until eventually a late
reply is received and, as a consequence, any further transmission
attempt remains pending, waiting for the channel to be relinquished by
the platform. Once that late reply is received the channel ownership
is given back to the agent and any pending request is then allowed to
proceed and overwrite the SMT area of the just delivered late reply;
then the wait for the reply to the new request starts. It has been
observed that the spurious IRQ related to the late reply can be
wrongly associated with the freshly enqueued request: when that
happens the SCMI stack in-flight lookup procedure is fooled by the
fact that the message header now present in the SMT area is related to
the new pending transaction, even though the real reply has still to
arrive. This race-condition on the A2P channel can be detected by
looking at the channel status bits: a genuine reply from the platform
will have set the channel free bit before triggering the completion
IRQ. Add a consistency check to validate such condition in the A2P
ISR.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
binder: fix race between mmput() and do_exit() Task A calls
binder_update_page_range() to allocate and insert pages on a remote
address space from Task B. For this, Task A pins the remote mm via
mmget_not_zero() first. This can race with Task B do_exit() and the
final mmput() refcount decrement will come from Task A. Task A | Task
B ------------------+------------------ mmget_not_zero() | | do_exit()
| exit_mm() | mmput() mmput() | exit_mmap() | remove_vma() | fput() |
In this case, the work of ____fput() from Task B is queued up in Task
A as TWA_RESUME. So in theory, Task A returns to userspace and the
cleanup work gets executed. However, Task A instead sleep, waiting for
a reply from Task B that never comes (it's dead). This means the
binder_deferred_release() is blocked until an unrelated binder event
forces Task A to go back to userspace. All the associated death
notifications will also be delayed until then. In order to fix this
use mmput_async() that will schedule the work in the corresponding
mm->async_put_work WQ instead of Task A.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net/sched: act_ct: fix skb leak and crash on ooo frags act_ct adds
skb->users before defragmentation. If frags arrive in order, the last
frag's reference is reset in: inet_frag_reasm_prepare skb_morph which
is not straightforward. However when frags arrive out of order, nobody
unref the last frag, and all frags are leaked. The situation is even
worse, as initiating packet capture can lead to a crash[0] when skb
has been cloned and shared at the same time. Fix the issue by removing
skb_get() before defragmentation. act_ct returns TC_ACT_CONSUMED when
defrag failed or in progress. [0]: [ 843.804823] ------------[ cut

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
wifi: rtw88: sdio: Honor the host max_req_size in the RX path Lukas
reports skb_over_panic errors on his Banana Pi BPI-CM4 which comes
with an Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC and a RTL8822CS SDIO wifi/Bluetooth
combo card. The error he observed is identical to what has been fixed
in commit e967229ead0e ("wifi: rtw88: sdio: Check the HISR RX_REQUEST
bit in rtw_sdio_rx_isr()") but that commit didn't fix Lukas' problem.
Lukas found that disabling or limiting RX aggregation works around the
problem for some time (but does not fully fix it). In the following
discussion a few key topics have been discussed which have an impact
on this problem: - The Amlogic A311D (G12B) SoC has a hardware bug in
the SDIO controller which prevents DMA transfers. Instead all
transfers need to go through the controller SRAM which limits
transfers to 1536 bytes - rtw88 chips don't split incoming (RX)
packets, so if a big packet is received this is forwarded to the host
in it's original form - rtw88 chips can do RX aggregation, meaning
more multiple incoming packets can be pulled by the host from the card
with one MMC/SDIO transfer. This Depends on settings in the
REG_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH register (BIT_RXDMA_AGG_PG_TH limits the number of
packets that will be aggregated, BIT_DMA_AGG_TO_V1 configures a
timeout for aggregation and BIT_EN_PRE_CALC makes the chip honor the
limits more effectively) Use multiple consecutive reads in
rtw_sdio_read_port() and limit the number of bytes which are copied by
the host from the card in one MMC/SDIO transfer. This allows receiving
a buffer that's larger than the hosts max_req_size (number of bytes
which can be transferred in one MMC/SDIO transfer). As a result of
this the skb_over_panic error is gone as the rtw88 driver is now able
to receive more than 1536 bytes from the card (either because the
incoming packet is larger than that or because multiple packets have
been aggregated). In case of an receive errors (-EILSEQ has been
observed by Lukas) we need to drain the remaining data from the card's
buffer, otherwise the card will return corrupt data for the next
rtw_sdio_read_port() call.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
hwrng: core - Fix page fault dead lock on mmap-ed hwrng There is a
dead-lock in the hwrng device read path. This triggers when the user
reads from /dev/hwrng into memory also mmap-ed from /dev/hwrng. The
resulting page fault triggers a recursive read which then dead-locks.
Fix this by using a stack buffer when calling copy_to_user.

crypto: lib/mpi - Fix unexpected pointer access in mpi_ec_init When
the mpi_ec_ctx structure is initialized, some fields are not cleared,
causing a crash when referencing the field when the structure was
released. Initially, this issue was ignored because memory for
mpi_ec_ctx is allocated with the __GFP_ZERO flag. For example, this

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
PCI: switchtec: Fix stdev_release() crash after surprise hot remove A
PCI device hot removal may occur while stdev->cdev is held open. The
call to stdev_release() then happens during close or exit, at a point
way past switchtec_pci_remove(). Otherwise the last ref would vanish
with the trailing put_device(), just before return. At that later
point in time, the devm cleanup has already removed the
stdev->mmio_mrpc mapping. Also, the stdev->pdev reference was not a
counted one. Therefore, in DMA mode, the iowrite32() in
stdev_release() will cause a fatal page fault, and the subsequent
dma_free_coherent(), if reached, would pass a stale &stdev->pdev->dev
pointer. Fix by moving MRPC DMA shutdown into switchtec_pci_remove(),
after stdev_kill(). Counting the stdev->pdev ref is now optional, but
may prevent future accidents. Reproducible via the script at

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
pstore/ram: Fix crash when setting number of cpus to an odd number
When the number of cpu cores is adjusted to 7 or other odd numbers,
the zone size will become an odd number. The address of the zone will
become: addr of zone0 = BASE addr of zone1 = BASE + zone_size addr of
zone2 = BASE + zone_size*2 ... The address of zone1/3/5/7 will be
mapped to non-alignment va. Eventually crashes will occur when
accessing these va. So, use ALIGN_DOWN() to make sure the zone size is
even to avoid this bug.

Issue summary: A bug has been identified in the processing of key and
initialisation vector (IV) lengths. This can lead to potential
truncation or overruns during the initialisation of some symmetric
ciphers. Impact summary: A truncation in the IV can result in non-
uniqueness, which could result in loss of confidentiality for some
cipher modes. When calling EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(),
EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() or EVP_CipherInit_ex2() the provided OSSL_PARAM
array is processed after the key and IV have been established. Any
alterations to the key length, via the "keylen" parameter or the IV
length, via the "ivlen" parameter, within the OSSL_PARAM array will
not take effect as intended, potentially causing truncation or
overreading of these values. The following ciphers and cipher modes
are impacted: RC2, RC4, RC5, CCM, GCM and OCB. For the CCM, GCM and
OCB cipher modes, truncation of the IV can result in loss of
confidentiality. For example, when following NIST's SP 800-38D section
8.2.1 guidance for constructing a deterministic IV for AES in GCM
mode, truncation of the counter portion could lead to IV reuse. Both
truncations and overruns of the key and overruns of the IV will
produce incorrect results and could, in some cases, trigger a memory
exception. However, these issues are not currently assessed as
security critical. Changing the key and/or IV lengths is not
considered to be a common operation and the vulnerable API was
recently introduced. Furthermore it is likely that application
developers will have spotted this problem during testing since
decryption would fail unless both peers in the communication were
similarly vulnerable. For these reasons we expect the probability of
an application being vulnerable to this to be quite low. However if an
application is vulnerable then this issue is considered very serious.
For these reasons we have assessed this issue as Moderate severity
overall. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this
issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this
because the issue lies outside of the FIPS provider boundary. OpenSSL
3.1 and 3.0 are vulnerable to this issue.

Before correction, the copy_file_range system call checked only for
the CAP_READ and CAP_WRITE capabilities on the input and output file

seeking, and the system call must additionally require the CAP_SEEK

A flaw was found in Undertow. When an AJP request is sent that exceeds
the max-header-size attribute in ajp-listener, JBoss EAP is marked in
an error state by mod_cluster in httpd, causing JBoss EAP to close the
TCP connection without returning an AJP response. This happens because
mod_proxy_cluster marks the JBoss EAP instance as an error worker when
the TCP connection is closed from the backend after sending the AJP
request without receiving an AJP response, and stops forwarding. This
issue could allow a malicious user could to repeatedly send requests
that exceed the max-header-size, causing a Denial of Service (DoS).

backup job is run that are intended to prevent directory listing and
file access. This means that an attacker could set the backup
directory to the root of another site in a shared environment and thus
disable that site.

An unsafe default configuration in KNIME Analytics Platform before
5.2.0 allows for a cross-site scripting attack. When KNIME Analytics
Platform is used as an executor for either KNIME Server or KNIME
Business Hub several JavaScript-based view nodes do not sanitize the
data that is displayed by default. If the data to be displayed
contains JavaScript this code is executed in the browser and can
perform any operations that the current user is allowed to perform
silently. KNIME Analytics Platform already has configuration options
with which sanitization of data can be actived, see
https://docs.knime.com/latest/webportal_admin_guide/index.html#html-
sanitization-webportal
https://docs.knime.com/latest/webportal_admin_guide/index.html#html-
sanitization-webportal . However, these are off by default which
allows for cross-site scripting attacks. KNIME Analytics Platform
5.2.0 will enable sanitization by default. For all previous releases
we recommend users to add the corresponding settings to the executor's
knime.ini.

The Featured Image Caption plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's shortcode and post meta
in all versions up to, and including, 0.8.10 due to insufficient input
sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes. This
makes it possible for authenticated attackers with contributor-level
and above permissions to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Brandon Rothel from QED Secure Solutions has found that the VAPIX API
tcptest.cgi did not have a sufficient input validation allowing for a
possible remote code execution. This flaw can only be exploited after
authenticating with an operator- or administrator-privileged service
account. The impact of exploiting this vulnerability is lower with
operator-privileges compared to administrator-privileges service
accounts. Axis has released patched AXIS OS versions for the
highlighted flaw. Please refer to the Axis security advisory for more
information and solution.

Issue summary: Generating excessively long X9.42 DH keys or checking
excessively long X9.42 DH keys or parameters may be very slow. Impact
summary: Applications that use the functions DH_generate_key() to
generate an X9.42 DH key may experience long delays. Likewise,
applications that use DH_check_pub_key(), DH_check_pub_key_ex() or
EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check an X9.42 DH key or X9.42 DH
parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or parameters
that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted source
this may lead to a Denial of Service. While DH_check() performs all
the necessary checks (as of CVE-2023-3817), DH_check_pub_key() doesn't
make any of these checks, and is therefore vulnerable for excessively
large P and Q parameters. Likewise, while DH_generate_key() performs a
check for an excessively large P, it doesn't check for an excessively
large Q. An application that calls DH_generate_key() or
DH_check_pub_key() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an
untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack.
DH_generate_key() and DH_check_pub_key() are also called by a number
of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other
functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by
this are DH_check_pub_key_ex(), EVP_PKEY_public_check(), and
EVP_PKEY_generate(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL pkey command line
application when using the "-pubcheck" option, as well as the OpenSSL
genpkey command line application. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation
is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers
are not affected by this issue.

A heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the Linux kernel's Linux
Kernel Performance Events (perf) component can be exploited to achieve
local privilege escalation. If perf_read_group() is called while an
event's sibling_list is smaller than its child's sibling_list, it can
increment or write to memory locations outside of the allocated
buffer. We recommend upgrading past commit
32671e3799ca2e4590773fd0e63aaa4229e50c06.

The Vue.js Devtools extension was found to leak screenshot data back
to a malicious web page via the standard `postMessage()` API. By
creating a malicious web page with an iFrame targeting a sensitive
resource (i.e. a locally accessible file or sensitive website), and
registering a listener on the web page, the extension sent messages
back to the listener, containing the base64 encoded screenshot data of
the sensitive resource.

The Crimson 3.2 Windows-based configuration tool allows users with
administrative access to define new passwords for users and to
download the resulting security configuration to a device. If such a
password contains the percent (%) character, invalid values will be
included, potentially truncating the string if a NUL is encountered.
If the simplified password is not detected by the administrator, the
device might be left in a vulnerable state as a result of more-easily
compromised credentials. Note that passwords entered via the Crimson
system web server do not suffer from this vulnerability.

The Post Meta Data Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including,
1.2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the
pmdm_wp_ajax_delete_meta, pmdm_wp_delete_user_meta, and
pmdm_wp_delete_user_meta functions. This makes it possible for
unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary user, term, and post
meta via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator
into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

The Icons Font Loader plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
file uploads due to missing file type validation in the upload
function in all versions up to, and including, 1.1.2. This makes it
possible for authenticated attackers, with administrator-level access
and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server
which may make remote code execution possible.

Reference: URL:https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2023-5868/

A memory disclosure vulnerability was found in PostgreSQL that allows
remote users to access sensitive information by exploiting certain
aggregate function calls with 'unknown'-type arguments. Handling
'unknown'-type values from string literals without type designation
can disclose bytes, potentially revealing notable and confidential
information. This issue exists due to excessive data output in
aggregate function calls, enabling remote users to read some portion
of system memory.

A flaw was found in PostgreSQL that allows authenticated database
users to execute arbitrary code through missing overflow checks during
SQL array value modification. This issue exists due to an integer
overflow during array modification where a remote user can trigger the
overflow by providing specially crafted data. This enables the
execution of arbitrary code on the target system, allowing users to
write arbitrary bytes to memory and extensively read the server's
memory.

FreeBSD 13.2-RELEASE prior to 13.2-RELEASE-p5 the __sflush() stdio
function in libc does not correctly update FILE objects' write space
members for write-buffered streams when the write(2) system call
returns an error. Depending on the nature of an application that calls
libc's stdio functions and the presence of errors returned from the

An Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in Trellix GetSusp
prior to version 5.0.0.27 allows a local, low privilege attacker to
gain access to files that usually require a higher privilege level.
This is caused by GetSusp not correctly protecting a directory that it
creates during execution, allowing an attacker to take over file
handles used by GetSusp. As this runs with high privileges, the
attacker gains elevated permissions. The file handles are opened as
read-only.

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code)
implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of
applications running on PowerPC CPU based platforms if the CPU
provides vector instructions. Impact summary: If an attacker can
influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application
state might be corrupted with various application dependent
consequences. The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code)
implementation in OpenSSL for PowerPC CPUs restores the contents of
vector registers in a different order than they are saved. Thus the
contents of some of these vector registers are corrupted when
returning to the caller. The vulnerable code is used only on newer
PowerPC processors supporting the PowerISA 2.07 instructions. The
consequences of this kind of internal application state corruption can
be various - from no consequences, if the calling application does not
depend on the contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the
worst consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of
the application process. However unless the compiler uses the vector
registers for storing pointers, the most likely consequence, if any,
would be an incorrect result of some application dependent
calculations or a crash leading to a denial of service. The POLY1305
MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of the CHACHA20-POLY1305
AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated data) algorithm. The
most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS protocol versions
1.2 and 1.3. If this cipher is enabled on the server a malicious
client can influence whether this AEAD cipher is used. This implies
that TLS server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially
impacted. However we are currently not aware of any concrete
application that would be affected by this issue therefore we consider
this a Low severity security issue.

quiche v. 0.15.0 through 0.19.0 was discovered to be vulnerable to
unbounded queuing of path validation messages, which could lead to
excessive resource consumption. QUIC path validation (RFC 9000 Section
8.2) requires that the recipient of a PATH_CHALLENGE frame responds by
sending a PATH_RESPONSE. An unauthenticated remote attacker can
exploit the vulnerability by sending PATH_CHALLENGE frames and
manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion
window size) so that PATH_RESPONSE frames can only be sent at the
slower rate than they are received; leading to storage of path
validation data in an unbounded queue. Quiche versions greater than
0.19.0 address this problem.

The Candid library causes a Denial of Service while parsing a
specially crafted payload with 'empty' data type. For example, if the
payload is `record { * ; empty }` and the canister interface expects
`record { * }` then the Rust candid decoder treats empty as an extra
field required by the type. The problem with the type empty is that
the candid Rust library wrongly categorizes empty as a recoverable
error when skipping the field and thus causing an infinite decoding
loop. Canisters using affected versions of candid are exposed to
denial of service by causing the decoding to run indefinitely until
the canister traps due to reaching maximum instruction limit per
execution round. Repeated exposure to the payload will result in
degraded performance of the canister. Note: Canisters written in
Motoko are unaffected.

The Master Slider &#8211; Responsive Touch Slider plugin for WordPress is
vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and
including, 3.9.3. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation
on the 'process_bulk_action' function. This makes it possible for
unauthenticated attackers to duplicate or delete arbitrary sliders via
a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
performing an action such as clicking on a link.

A flaw was found in the Quarkus Cache Runtime. When request processing
utilizes a Uni cached using @CacheResult and the cached Uni reuses the
initial "completion" context, the processing switches to the cached
Uni instead of the request context. This is a problem if the cached
Uni context contains sensitive information, and could allow a
malicious user to benefit from a POST request returning the response
that is meant for another user, gaining access to sensitive data.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20240116 CVE-2023-6395 Mock: Privilege escalation for users that can access mock configuration

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20240116 Mock, Snap, LXC expose(d) chroot, container trees with unsafe permissions and contents to host users, pose risk to host
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/01/16/3

The Mock software contains a vulnerability wherein an attacker could
potentially exploit privilege escalation, enabling the execution of
arbitrary code with root user privileges. This weakness stems from the
absence of proper sandboxing during the expansion and execution of
Jinja2 templates, which may be included in certain configuration
parameters. While the Mock documentation advises treating users added
to the mock group as privileged, certain build systems invoking mock
on behalf of users might inadvertently permit less privileged users to
define configuration tags. These tags could then be passed as
parameters to mock during execution, potentially leading to the
utilization of Jinja2 templates for remote privilege escalation and
the execution of arbitrary code as the root user on the build server.

The Contact Form 7 plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
file uploads due to insufficient file type validation in the
'validate' function and insufficient blocklisting on the
'wpcf7_antiscript_file_name' function in versions up to, and
including, 5.8.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with editor-level capabilities or above to upload arbitrary files on
the affected site's server, but due to the htaccess configuration,
remote code cannot be executed in most cases. By default, the file
will be deleted from the server immediately. However, in some cases,
other plugins may make it possible for the file to live on the server
longer. This can make remote code execution possible when combined
with another vulnerability, such as local file inclusion.

The Shariff Wrapper plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
Cross-Site Scripting via the plugin's 'shariff' shortcode in all
versions up to, and including, 4.6.9 due to insufficient input
sanitization and output escaping on user supplied attributes such as
'secondarycolor' and 'maincolor'. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a
user accesses an injected page.

An issue was found in CPython 3.12.0 `subprocess` module on POSIX
platforms. The issue was fixed in CPython 3.12.1 and does not affect
other stable releases. When using the `extra_groups=` parameter with
an empty list as a value (ie `extra_groups=[]`) the logic regressed to
not call `setgroups(0, NULL)` before calling `exec()`, thus not
dropping the original processes' groups before starting the new
process. There is no issue when the parameter isn't used or when any
value is used besides an empty list. This issue only impacts CPython
processes run with sufficient privilege to make the `setgroups` system
call (typically `root`).

To keep its cache database efficient, `named` running as a recursive
resolver occasionally attempts to clean up the database. It uses
several methods, including some that are asynchronous: a small chunk
of memory pointing to the cache element that can be cleaned up is
first allocated and then queued for later processing. It was
discovered that if the resolver is continuously processing query
patterns triggering this type of cache-database maintenance, `named`
may not be able to handle the cleanup events in a timely manner. This
in turn enables the list of queued cleanup events to grow infinitely
large over time, allowing the configured `max-cache-size` limit to be
significantly exceeded. This issue affects BIND 9 versions 9.16.0
through 9.16.45 and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.45-S1.

The WP 2FA &#8211; Two-factor authentication for WordPress plugin for
WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions
up to, and including, 2.5.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce
validation on the send_backup_codes_email function. This makes it
possible for unauthenticated attackers to send emails with arbitrary
content to registered users via a forged request granted they can
trick a site administrator or other registered user into performing an
action such as clicking on a link. While a nonce check is present, it
is only executed if a nonce is set. By omitting a nonce from the
request, the check can be bypassed.

The WordPress Button Plugin MaxButtons plugin for WordPress is
vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via admin settings in all
versions up to, and including, 9.7.4 due to insufficient input
sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and
above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-
site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been
disabled. Administrators can give button creation privileges to users
with lower levels (contributor+) which would allow those lower-
privileged users to carry out attacks.
