Reference: URL:https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-23:18.nfsclient.asc

When a program running on an affected system appends data to a file
via an NFS client mount, the bug can cause the NFS client to fail to
copy in the data to be written but proceed as though the copy
operation had succeeded. This means that the data to be written is
instead replaced with whatever data had been in the packet buffer
previously. Thus, an unprivileged user with access to an affected
system may abuse the bug to trigger disclosure of sensitive
information. In particular, the leak is limited to data previously
stored in mbufs, which are used for network transmission and
reception, and for certain types of inter-process communication. The
bug can also be triggered unintentionally by system applications, in
which case the data written by the application to an NFS mount may be
corrupted. Corrupted data is written over the network to the NFS
server, and thus also susceptible to being snooped by other hosts on
the network. Note that the bug exists only in the NFS client; the
version and implementation of the server has no effect on whether a
given system is affected by the problem.

A flaw was found in X.Org server. Both DeviceFocusEvent and the
XIQueryPointer reply contain a bit for each logical button currently
down. Buttons can be arbitrarily mapped to any value up to 255, but
the X.Org Server was only allocating space for the device's particular

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/22/13

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter:
nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege
escalation. The function nft_pipapo_walk did not skip inactive
elements during set walk which could lead double deactivations of
PIPAPO (Pile Packet Policies) elements, leading to use-after-free. We
recommend upgrading past commit
317eb9685095678f2c9f5a8189de698c5354316a.

The File Manager and File Manager Pro plugins for WordPress are
vulnerable to Directory Traversal in versions up to, and including
version 7.2.1 (free version) and 8.3.4 (Pro version) via the target
parameter in the mk_file_folder_manager_action_callback_shortcode
function. This makes it possible for attackers to read the contents of
arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information
and to upload files into directories other than the intended directory
for file uploads. The free version requires Administrator access for
this vulnerability to be exploitable. The Pro version allows a file
manager to be embedded via a shortcode and also allows admins to grant
file handling privileges to other user levels, which could lead to
this vulnerability being exploited by lower-level users.

A vulnerability has been identified in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
package, stemming from the mixed privilege levels utilized by systemd
services associated with PCP. While certain services operate within
the confines of limited PCP user/group privileges, others are granted
full root privileges. This disparity in privilege levels poses a risk
when privileged root processes interact with directories or directory
trees owned by unprivileged PCP users. Specifically, this
vulnerability may lead to the compromise of PCP user isolation and
facilitate local PCP-to-root exploits, particularly through symlink
attacks. These vulnerabilities underscore the importance of
maintaining robust privilege separation mechanisms within PCP to
mitigate the potential for unauthorized privilege escalation.

A flaw was found in the libssh implements abstract layer for message
digest (MD) operations implemented by different supported crypto
backends. The return values from these were not properly checked,
which could cause low-memory situations failures, NULL dereferences,
crashes, or usage of the uninitialized memory as an input for the KDF.
In this case, non-matching keys will result in decryption/integrity
failures, terminating the connection.

wolfSSL SP Math All RSA implementation is vulnerable to the Marvin
Attack, new variation of a timing Bleichenbacher style attack, when
built with the following options to configure: --enable-all
CFLAGS="-DWOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA" The define &#8220;WOLFSSL_STATIC_RSA&#8221; enables
static RSA cipher suites, which is not recommended, and has been
disabled by default since wolfSSL 3.6.6. Therefore the default build
since 3.6.6, even with "--enable-all", is not vulnerable to the Marvin
Attack. The vulnerability is specific to static RSA cipher suites, and
expected to be padding-independent. The vulnerability allows an
attacker to decrypt ciphertexts and forge signatures after probing
with a large number of test observations. However the server&#8217;s private
key is not exposed.

In wolfSSL prior to 5.6.6, if callback functions are enabled (via the

wolfSSL prior to 5.6.6 did not check that messages in one (D)TLS
record do not span key boundaries. As a result, it was possible to
combine (D)TLS messages using different keys into one (D)TLS record.
The most extreme edge case is that, in (D)TLS 1.3, it was possible
that an unencrypted (D)TLS 1.3 record from the server containing first
a ServerHello message and then the rest of the first server flight
would be accepted by a wolfSSL client. In (D)TLS 1.3 the handshake is
encrypted after the ServerHello but a wolfSSL client would accept an
unencrypted flight from the server. This does not compromise key
negotiation and authentication so it is assigned a low severity
rating.

The V8 inspector intentionally allows arbitrary code execution within
the Workers sandbox for debugging. wrangler dev would previously start
an inspector server listening on all network interfaces. This would
allow an attacker on the local network to connect to the inspector and
run arbitrary code. Additionally, the inspector server did not
validate Origin/Host headers, granting an attacker that can trick any
user on the local network into opening a malicious website the ability
to run code. If wrangler dev --remote was being used, an attacker
could access production resources if they were bound to the worker.
This issue was fixed in wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2. Whilst
wrangler dev's inspector server listens on local interfaces by default
as of wrangler@3.16.0, an SSRF vulnerability in miniflare
https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-
fwvg-2739-22v7 (CVE-2023-7078) allowed access from the local network
until wrangler@3.18.0. wrangler@3.19.0 and wrangler@2.20.2 introduced
validation for the Origin/Host headers.

The Photo Gallery by 10Web &#8211; Mobile-Friendly Image Gallery plugin for
WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Traversal in all versions up to,
and including, 1.8.19 via the rename_item function. This makes it
possible for authenticated attackers to rename arbitrary files on the
server. This can lead to site takeovers if the wp-config.php file of a
site can be renamed. By default this can be exploited by
administrators only. In the premium version of the plugin,
administrators can give gallery management permissions to lower level
users, which might make this exploitable by users as low as
contributors.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/01/msg00016.html

A flaw was found in the X.Org server. The GLX PBuffer code does not
call the XACE hook when creating the buffer, leaving it unlabeled.
When the client issues another request to access that resource (as
with a GetGeometry) or when it creates another resource that needs to
access that buffer, such as a GC, the XSELINUX code will try to use an
object that was never labeled and crash because the SID is NULL.

User can send a chat that contains an XSS opportunity that will then
run when the chat is sent and on subsequent page loads. Given the
minimum requirement for a user to send a chat is to be given access to
a workspace via an admin the risk is low. Additionally, the location
in which the XSS renders is only limited to the user who submits the
XSS. Ultimately, this attack is limited to the user attacking
themselves. There is no anonymous chat submission unless the user does

Theoretically, it would be possible for an attacker to brute-force the
password for an instance in single-user password protection mode via a
timing attack given the linear nature of the `!==` used for
comparison. The risk is minified by the additional overhead of the
request, which varies in a non-constant nature making the attack less
reliable to execute

As a manager, you should not be able to modify a series of settings.
In the UI this is indeed hidden as a convenience for the role since
most managers would not be savvy enough to modify these settings. They
can use their token to still modify those settings though through a
standard HTTP request While this is not a critical vulnerability, it
does indeed need to be patched to enforce the expected permission
level.

A flaw was found in the blkgs destruction path in block/blk-cgroup.c
in the Linux kernel, leading to a cgroup blkio memory leakage problem.
When a cgroup is being destroyed, cgroup_rstat_flush() is only called
at css_release_work_fn(), which is called when the blkcg reference
count reaches 0. This circular dependency will prevent blkcg and some
blkgs from being freed after they are made offline. This issue may
allow an attacker with a local access to cause system instability,
such as an out of memory error.

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel's memory deduplication mechanism.
The max page sharing of Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM), added in Linux
kernel version 4.4.0-96.119, can create a side channel. When the
attacker and the victim share the same host and the default setting of
KSM is "max page sharing=256", it is possible for the attacker to time
the unmap to merge with the victim's page. The unmapping time depends
on whether it merges with the victim's page and additional physical
pages are created beyond the KSM's "max page share". Through these
operations, the attacker can leak the victim's page.

A flaw was found in the Netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel. The
issue is in the nft_byteorder_eval() function, where the code iterates
through a loop and writes to the `dst` array. On each iteration, 8
bytes are written, but `dst` is an array of u32, so each element only
has space for 4 bytes. That means every iteration overwrites part of
the previous element corrupting this array of u32. This flaw allows a
local user to cause a denial of service or potentially break NetFilter
functionality.

The Oliver POS &#8211; A WooCommerce Point of Sale (POS) plugin for
WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access due to missing
capability checks on several functions hooked via AJAX in the
includes/class-pos-bridge-install.php file in all versions up to, and

Issue summary: Processing a maliciously formatted PKCS12 file may lead
OpenSSL to crash leading to a potential Denial of Service attack
Impact summary: Applications loading files in the PKCS12 format from
untrusted sources might terminate abruptly. A file in PKCS12 format
can contain certificates and keys and may come from an untrusted
source. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but
OpenSSL does not correctly check for this case. This can lead to a
NULL pointer dereference that results in OpenSSL crashing. If an
application processes PKCS12 files from an untrusted source using the
OpenSSL APIs then that application will be vulnerable to this issue.
OpenSSL APIs that are vulnerable to this are: PKCS12_parse(),
PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(),
PKCS12_unpack_authsafes() and PKCS12_newpass(). We have also fixed a
similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7(). However since this function is
related to writing data we do not consider it security significant.
The FIPS modules in 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Should an instance of AnythingLLM be hosted on an internal network and
the attacked be explicitly granted a permission level of manager or
admin, they could link-scrape internally resolving IPs of other
services that are on the same network as AnythingLLM. This would
require the attacker also be able to guess these internal IPs as `/*`
ranging is not possible, but could be brute forced. There is a duty of
care that other services on the same network would not be fully open
and accessible via a simple CuRL with zero authentication as it is not
possible to set headers or access via the link collector.

The File Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Sensitive
Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 7.2.1 due
to insufficient randomness in the backup filenames, which use a
timestamp plus 4 random digits. This makes it possible for
unauthenticated attackers, to extract sensitive data including site
backups in configurations where the .htaccess file in the directory
does not block access.

As a default user on a multi-user instance of AnythingLLM, you could
execute a call to the `/export-data` endpoint of the system and then
unzip and read that export that would enable you do exfiltrate data of
the system at that save state. This would require the attacked to be
granted explicit access to the system, but they can do this at any
role. Additionally, post-download, the data is deleted so no evidence
would exist that the exfiltration occured.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00017.html

Late privilege drop in REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY in
PostgreSQL allows an object creator to execute arbitrary SQL functions
as the command issuer. The command intends to run SQL functions as the
owner of the materialized view, enabling safe refresh of untrusted
materialized views. The victim is a superuser or member of one of the
attacker's roles. The attack requires luring the victim into running
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY on the attacker's materialized
view. As part of exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker creates
functions that use CREATE RULE to convert the internally-built
temporary table to a view. Versions before PostgreSQL 15.6, 14.11,
13.14, and 12.18 are affected. The only known exploit does not work in
PostgreSQL 16 and later. For defense in depth, PostgreSQL 16.2 adds
the protections that older branches are using to fix their
vulnerability.

ModSecurity / libModSecurity 3.0.0 to 3.0.11 is affected by a WAF
bypass for path-based payloads submitted via specially crafted request
URLs. ModSecurity v3 decodes percent-encoded characters present in
request URLs before it separates the URL path component from the
optional query string component. This results in an impedance mismatch
versus RFC compliant back-end applications. The vulnerability hides an
attack payload in the path component of the URL from WAF rules
inspecting it. A back-end may be vulnerable if it uses the path
component of request URLs to construct queries. Integrators and users
are advised to upgrade to 3.0.12. The ModSecurity v2 release line is
not affected by this vulnerability.

A path traversal vulnerability was identified in GitHub Enterprise
Server that allowed an attacker to gain unauthorized read permission
to files by deploying arbitrary symbolic links to a GitHub Pages site
with a specially crafted artifact tarball. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and build a
GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. This
vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server prior
to 3.12 and was fixed in versions 3.8.15, 3.9.10, 3.10.7, 3.11.5. This
vulnerability was reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter:
nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege
escalation. The nft_setelem_catchall_deactivate() function checks
whether the catch-all set element is active in the current generation
instead of the next generation before freeing it, but only flags it
inactive in the next generation, making it possible to free the
element multiple times, leading to a double free vulnerability. We
recommend upgrading past commit
b1db244ffd041a49ecc9618e8feb6b5c1afcdaa7.

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's netfilter:
nf_tables component can be exploited to achieve local privilege
escalation. The nft_verdict_init() function allows positive values as
drop error within the hook verdict, and hence the nf_hook_slow()

A memory leak flaw was found in Golang in the RSA
encrypting/decrypting code, which might lead to a resource exhaustion
vulnerability using attacker-controlled inputs&#8203;. The memory leak
happens in github.com/golang-fips/openssl/openssl/rsa.go#L113. The
objects leaked are pkey&#8203; and ctx&#8203;. That function uses named return
parameters to free pkey&#8203; and ctx&#8203; if there is an error initializing
the context or setting the different properties. All return statements
related to error cases follow the "return nil, nil, fail(...)"
pattern, meaning that pkey&#8203; and ctx&#8203; will be nil inside the deferred
function that should free them.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/cloudflare/quiche/security/advisories/GHSA-xhg9-xwch-vr7x

Cloudflare quiche was discovered to be vulnerable to unbounded storage
of information related to connection ID retirement, which could lead
to excessive resource consumption. Each QUIC connection possesses a
set of connection Identifiers (IDs); see RFC 9000 Section 5.1
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-5.1 . Endpoints
declare the number of active connection IDs they are willing to
support using the active_connection_id_limit transport parameter. The
peer can create new IDs using a NEW_CONNECTION_ID frame but must stay
within the active ID limit. This is done by retirement of old IDs, the
endpoint sends NEW_CONNECTION_ID includes a value in the
retire_prior_to field, which elicits a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame as
confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the
vulnerability by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and manipulating the
connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so
that RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate
than they are received, leading to storage of information related to
connection IDs in an unbounded queue. Quiche versions 0.19.2 and
0.20.1 are the earliest to address this problem. There is no
workaround for affected versions.

The use-after-free vulnerability was found in the AuthentIC driver in
OpenSC packages, occuring in the card enrolment process using
pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrols or modifies cards. An
attacker must have physical access to the computer system and requires
a crafted USB device or smart card to present the system with
specially crafted responses to the APDUs, which are considered high
complexity and low severity. This manipulation can allow for
compromised card management operations during enrolment.

The XMLOutputParser in LangChain uses the etree module from the XML
parser in the standard python library which has some XML
vulnerabilities; see: https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.html This
primarily affects users that combine an LLM (or agent) with the
`XMLOutputParser` and expose the component via an endpoint on a web-
service. This would allow a malicious party to attempt to manipulate
the LLM to produce a malicious payload for the parser that would
compromise the availability of the service. A successful attack is
predicated on: 1. Usage of XMLOutputParser 2. Passing of malicious
input into the XMLOutputParser either directly or by trying to
manipulate an LLM to do so on the users behalf 3. Exposing the
component via a web-service

The Gutenberg Blocks by Kadence Blocks &#8211; Page Builder Features plugin
for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the
htmlTag attribute in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.23 due to
insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it
possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor access and
above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
whenever a user accesses an injected page.

The `fetch()` API and navigation incorrectly shared the same cache, as
the cache key did not include the optional headers `fetch()` may
contain. Under the correct circumstances, an attacker may have been
able to poison the local browser cache by priming it with a `fetch()`
response controlled by the additional headers. Upon navigation to the
same URL, the user would see the cached response instead of the
expected response. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 123.

pgjdbc, the PostgreSQL JDBC Driver, allows attacker to inject SQL if
using PreferQueryMode=SIMPLE. Note this is not the default. In the
default mode there is no vulnerability. A placeholder for a numeric
value must be immediately preceded by a minus. There must be a second
placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder; both must
be on the same line. By constructing a matching string payload, the
attacker can inject SQL to alter the query,bypassing the protections
that parameterized queries bring against SQL Injection attacks.

Impact: The library offers a function to generate an ed25519 key pair
via Ed25519KeyIdentity.generate with an optional param to provide a 32
byte seed value, which will then be used as the secret key. When no
seed value is provided, it is expected that the library generates the
secret key using secure randomness. However, a recent change broke
this guarantee and uses an insecure seed for key pair generation.
Since the private key of this identity (535yc-uxytb-
gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe) is compromised,
one could lose funds associated with the principal on ledgers or lose
access to a canister where this principal is the controller.

A vulnerability was found in Undertow. This vulnerability impacts a
server that supports the wildfly-http-client protocol. Whenever a
malicious user opens and closes a connection with the HTTP port of the
server and then closes the connection immediately, the server will end
with both memory and open file limits exhausted at some point,
depending on the amount of memory available. At HTTP upgrade to
remoting, the WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit leaks connections if
RemotingConnection is closed by Remoting ServerConnectionOpenListener.
Because the remoting connection originates in Undertow as part of the
HTTP upgrade, there is an external layer to the remoting connection.
This connection is unaware of the outermost layer when closing the
connection during the connection opening procedure. Hence, the
Undertow WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit is not notified of the closed
connection in this scenario. Because WriteTimeoutStreamSinkConduit
creates a timeout task, the whole dependency tree leaks via that task,
which is added to XNIO WorkerThread. So, the workerThread points to
the Undertow conduit, which contains the connections and causes the
leak.

The Auto Refresh Single Page plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP
Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.1 via
deserialization of untrusted input from the arsp_options post meta

contributor-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known
POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is
present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target

A flaw was found in Buildah (and subsequently Podman Build) which
allows containers to mount arbitrary locations on the host filesystem
into build containers. A malicious Containerfile can use a dummy image
with a symbolic link to the root filesystem as a mount source and
cause the mount operation to mount the host root filesystem inside the
RUN step. The commands inside the RUN step will then have read-write
access to the host filesystem, allowing for full container escape at
build time.

The PDF Invoices and Packing Slips For WooCommerce plugin for
WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to,
and including, 1.3.7 via deserialization of untrusted input via the
order_id parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated
attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP
Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a
POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on
the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary
files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

The Nextend Social Login and Register plugin for WordPress is
vulnerable to a self-based Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the
&#8216;error_description&#8217; parameter in all versions up to, and including,
3.1.12 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.
This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers, with access to a
subscriber-level account, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages
that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an
action such as clicking on a link. NOTE: This vulnerability can be
successfully exploited on a vulnerable WordPress instance against an
OAuth pre-authenticated higher-level user (e.g., administrator) by
leveraging a cross-site request forgery in conjunction with a certain
social engineering technique to achieve a critical impact scenario
(cross-site scripting to administrator-level account creation).
However, successful exploitation requires "Debug mode" to be enabled
in the plugin's "Global Settings".
