Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger purpose-built
for decentralized identity. In versions 1.12.4 and prior, the `pool-
upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node allows an improperly
authenticated attacker to remotely execute code on nodes within the
network. The `pool-upgrade` request handler in Indy-Node 1.12.5 has
been updated to properly authenticate pool-upgrade transactions before
any processing is performed by the request handler. The transactions
are further sanitized to prevent remote code execution. As a
workaround, endorsers should not create DIDs for untrusted users. A
vulnerable ledger should configure `auth_rules` to prevent new DIDs
from being written to the ledger until the network can be upgraded.

Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. A weakness
in the Hyperledger AnonCreds specification that is not mitigated in
the Ursa and AnonCreds implementations is that the Issuer does not
publish a key correctness proof demonstrating that a generated private
key is sufficient to meet the unlinkability guarantees of AnonCreds.
The Ursa and AnonCreds CL-Signatures implementations always generate a
sufficient private key. A malicious issuer could in theory create a
custom CL Signature implementation (derived from the Ursa or AnonCreds
CL-Signatures implementations) that uses weakened private keys such
that presentations from holders could be shared by verifiers to the
issuer who could determine the holder to which the credential was
issued. This vulnerability could impact holders of AnonCreds
credentials implemented using the CL-signature scheme in the Ursa and
AnonCreds implementations of CL Signatures. The ursa project has has
moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.

Bleve is a text indexing library for go. Bleve includes HTTP utilities
under bleve/http package, that are used by its sample application.
These HTTP methods pave way for exploitation of a node&#8217;s filesystem
where the bleve index resides, if the user has used bleve&#8217;s own HTTP
(bleve/http) handlers for exposing the access to the indexes. For
instance, the CreateIndexHandler (`http/index_create.go`) and
DeleteIndexHandler (`http/index_delete.go`) enable an attacker to
create a bleve index (directory structure) anywhere where the user
running the server has the write permissions and to delete recursively
any directory owned by the same user account. Users who have used the
bleve/http package for exposing access to bleve index without the
explicit handling for the Role Based Access Controls(RBAC) of the
index assets would be impacted by this issue. There is no patch for
this issue because the http package is purely intended to be used for
demonstration purposes. Bleve was never designed handle the RBACs, nor
it was ever advertised to be used in that way. The collaborators of
this project have decided to stay away from adding any authentication
or authorization to bleve project at the moment. The bleve/http
package is mainly for demonstration purposes and it lacks exhaustive
validation of the user inputs as well as any authentication and
authorization measures. It is recommended to not use bleve/http in
production use cases.

Play Framework is a web framework for Java and Scala. Verions prior to
2.8.16 are vulnerable to generation of error messages containing
sensitive information. Play Framework, when run in dev mode, shows
verbose errors for easy debugging, including an exception stack trace.
Play does this by configuring its `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` to do so
based on the application mode. In its Scala API Play also provides a
static object `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` that is configured to always
show verbose errors. This is used as a default value in some Play
APIs, so it is possible to inadvertently use this version in
production. It is also possible to improperly configure the
`DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object instance as the injected error
handler. Both of these situations could result in verbose errors
displaying to users in a production application, which could expose
sensitive information from the application. In particular, the
constructor for `CORSFilter` and `apply` method for
`CORSActionBuilder` use the static object `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` as
a default value. This is patched in Play Framework 2.8.16. The
`DefaultHttpErrorHandler` object has been changed to use the prod-mode
behavior, and `DevHttpErrorHandler` has been introduced for the dev-
mode behavior. A workaround is available. When constructing a
`CORSFilter` or `CORSActionBuilder`, ensure that a properly-configured
error handler is passed. Generally this should be done by using the
`HttpErrorHandler` instance provided through dependency injection or
through Play's `BuiltInComponents`. Ensure that the application is not
using the `DefaultHttpErrorHandler` static object in any code that may
be run in production.

OAuthenticator is an OAuth token library for the JupyerHub login
handler. CILogonOAuthenticator is provided by the OAuthenticator
package, and lets users log in to a JupyterHub via CILogon. This is
primarily used to restrict a JupyterHub only to users of a given
institute. The allowed_idps configuration trait of
CILogonOAuthenticator is documented to be a list of domains that
indicate the institutions whose users are authorized to access this
JupyterHub. This authorization is validated by ensuring that the
*email* field provided to us by CILogon has a *domain* that matches
one of the domains listed in `allowed_idps`.If `allowed_idps` contains
`berkeley.edu`, you might expect only users with valid current
credentials provided by University of California, Berkeley to be able
to access the JupyterHub. However, CILogonOAuthenticator does *not*
verify which provider is used by the user to login, only the email
address provided. So a user can login with a GitHub account that has
email set to `<something>@berkeley.edu`, and that will be treated
exactly the same as someone logging in using the UC Berkeley official
Identity Provider. The patch fixing this issue makes a *breaking
change* in how `allowed_idps` is interpreted. It's no longer a list of
domains, but configuration representing the `EntityID` of the IdPs
that are allowed, picked from the [list maintained by
CILogon](https://cilogon.org/idplist/). Users are advised to upgrade.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/07/1

containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in the
containerd's CRI implementation where programs inside a container can
cause the containerd daemon to consume memory without bound during
invocation of the `ExecSync` API. This can cause containerd to consume
all available memory on the computer, denying service to other
legitimate workloads. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to
use containerd's CRI implementation; `ExecSync` may be used when
running probes or when executing processes via an "exec" facility.
This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.6 and 1.5.13. Users should
update to these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade
should ensure that only trusted images and commands are used.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v0.11.0 are
vulnerable to a variety of attacks when an SSO login is initiated from
the Argo CD CLI or UI. The vulnerabilities are due to the use of
insufficiently random values in parameters in Oauth2/OIDC login flows.
In each case, using a relatively-predictable (time-based) seed in a
non-cryptographically-secure pseudo-random number generator made the
parameter less random than required by the relevant spec or by general
best practices. In some cases, using too short a value made the
entropy even less sufficient. The attacks on login flows which are
meant to be mitigated by these parameters are difficult to accomplish
but can have a high impact potentially granting an attacker admin
access to Argo CD. Patches for this vulnerability has been released in
the following Argo CD versions: v2.4.1, v2.3.5, v2.2.10 and v2.1.16.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting with v1.3.0 are
vulnerable to a symlink following bug allowing a malicious user with
repository write access to leak sensitive YAML files from Argo CD's
repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user with write access for a
repository which is (or may be) used in a Helm-type Application may
commit a symlink which points to an out-of-bounds file. If the target
file is a valid YAML file, the attacker can read the contents of that
file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include manifest files
from other Applications' source repositories (potentially decrypted
files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or any YAML-formatted
secrets which have been mounted as files on the repo-server. Patches
for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD
versions: v2.4.1, v2.3.5, v2.2.10 and v2.1.16. If you are using a
version >=v2.3.0 and do not have any Helm-type Applications you may
disable the Helm config management tool as a workaround.

Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms.
Prior to versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1, the cookie consent page in Open
Forms contains an open redirect by injecting a `referer` querystring
parameter and failing to validate the value. A malicious actor is able
to redirect users to a website under their control, opening them up
for phishing attacks. The redirect is initiated by the open forms
backend which is a legimate page, making it less obvious to end users
they are being redirected to a malicious website. Versions 1.0.9 and
1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. There are no known workarounds

Open Forms is an application for creating and publishing smart forms.
Open Forms supports file uploads as one of the form field types. These
fields can be configured to allow only certain file extensions to be
uploaded by end users (e.g. only PDF / Excel / ...). The input
validation of uploaded files is insufficient in versions prior to
1.0.9 and 1.1.1. Users could alter or strip file extensions to bypass
this validation. This results in files being uploaded to the server
that are of a different file type than indicated by the file name
extension. These files may be downloaded (manually or automatically)
by staff and/or other applications for further processing. Malicious
files can therefore find their way into internal/trusted networks.
Versions 1.0.9 and 1.1.1 contain patches for this issue. As a
workaround, an API gateway or intrusion detection solution in front of
open-forms may be able to scan for and block malicious content before
it reaches the Open Forms application.

Guzzle is an open source PHP HTTP client. In affected versions the
`Cookie` headers on requests are sensitive information. On making a
request using the `https` scheme to a server which responds with a
redirect to a URI with the `http` scheme, or on making a request to a
server which responds with a redirect to a a URI to a different host,
we should not forward the `Cookie` header on. Prior to this fix, only
cookies that were managed by our cookie middleware would be safely
removed, and any `Cookie` header manually added to the initial request
would not be stripped. We now always strip it, and allow the cookie
middleware to re-add any cookies that it deems should be there.
Affected Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.4 as soon as
possible. Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should
upgrade to Guzzle 6.5.7 or 7.4.4. Users unable to upgrade may consider
an alternative approach to use your own redirect middleware, rather
than ours. If you do not require or expect redirects to be followed,
one should simply disable redirects all together.

Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console,
command line tools and a WebAPI. The Key Storage converter plugin
mechanism was not enabled correctly in Rundeck 4.2.0 and 4.2.1,
resulting in use of the encryption layer for Key Storage possibly not
working. Any credentials created or overwritten using Rundeck 4.2.0 or
4.2.1 might result in them being written in plaintext to the backend
storage. This affects those using any `Storage Converter` plugin.
Rundeck 4.3.1 and 4.2.2 have fixed the code and upon upgrade will re-
encrypt any plain text values. Version 4.3.0 does not have the
vulnerability, but does not include the patch to re-encrypt plain text
values if 4.2.0 or 4.2.1 were used. To prevent plaintext credentials
from being stored in Rundeck 4.2.0/4.2.1, write access to key storage
can be disabled via ACLs. After upgrading to 4.3.1 or later, write
access can be restored.

Synapse is an open source home server implementation for the Matrix
chat network. In versions prior to 1.61.1 URL previews of some web
pages can exhaust the available stack space for the Synapse process
due to unbounded recursion. This is sometimes recoverable and leads to
an error for the request causing the problem, but in other cases the
Synapse process may crash altogether. It is possible to exploit this
maliciously, either by malicious users on the homeserver, or by remote
users sending URLs that a local user's client may automatically
request a URL preview for. Remote users are not able to exploit this
directly, because the URL preview endpoint is authenticated.
Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: false` set in configuration are
not affected. Deployments with `url_preview_enabled: true` set in
configuration **are** affected. Deployments with no configuration
value set for `url_preview_enabled` are not affected, because the
default is `false`. Administrators of homeservers with URL previews
enabled are advised to upgrade to v1.61.1 or higher. Users unable to
upgrade should set `url_preview_enabled` to false.

Biscuit is an authentication and authorization token for microservices
architectures. The Biscuit specification version 1 contains a
vulnerable algorithm that allows malicious actors to forge valid
&#915;-signatures. Such an attack would allow an attacker to create a token
with any access level. The version 2 of the specification mandates a
different algorithm than gamma signatures and as such is not affected
by this vulnerability. The Biscuit implementations in Rust, Haskell,
Go, Java and Javascript all have published versions following the v2
specification. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Argo Events is an event-driven workflow automation framework for
Kubernetes. Prior to version 1.7.1, several `HandleRoute` endpoints
make use of the deprecated `ioutil.ReadAll()`. `ioutil.ReadAll()`
reads all the data into memory. As such, an attacker who sends a large
request to the Argo Events server will be able to crash it and cause
denial of service. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in
Argo Events version 1.7.1.

EdgeX Foundry is an open source project for building a common open
framework for Internet of Things edge computing. Prior to version
2.1.1, the /api/v2/config endpoint exposes message bus credentials to
local unauthenticated users. In security-enabled mode, message bus
credentials are supposed to be kept in the EdgeX secret store and
require authentication to access. This vulnerability bypasses the
access controls on message bus credentials when running in security-
enabled mode. (No credentials are required when running in security-
disabled mode.) As a result, attackers could intercept data or inject
fake data into the EdgeX message bus. Users should upgrade to
EdgeXFoundry Kamakura release (2.2.0) or to the June 2022 EdgeXFoundry
LTS Jakarta release (2.1.1) to receive a patch. More information about
which go modules, docker containers, and snaps contain patches is
available in the GitHub Security Advisory. There are currently no
known workarounds for this issue.

NestJS Proxy is a NestJS module to decorate and proxy calls. Prior to
version 0.7.0, the nestjs-proxy library did not have a way to control
when Authorization headers should should be forwarded for specific
backend services configured by the application developer. This could
have resulted in sensitive information such as OAuth bearer access
tokens being inadvertently exposed to such services that should not
see them. A new feature has been introduced in the patched version of
nestjs-proxy that allows application developers to opt out of
forwarding the Authorization headers on a per service basis using the

this configuration can be applied. This issue has been fixed in

KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to
versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the ServiceBus server on the edge
side may be susceptible to a DoS attack if an HTTP request containing
a very large Body is sent to it. It is possible for the node to be
exhausted of memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is that other
services on the node, e.g. other containers, will be unable to
allocate memory and thus causing a denial of service. Malicious apps
accidentally pulled by users on the host and have the access to send
HTTP requests to localhost may make an attack. It will be affected
only when users enable the `ServiceBus` module in the config file
`edgecore.yaml`. This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2,
and 1.9.4. As a workaround, disable the `ServiceBus` module in the
config file `edgecore.yaml`.

KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to
versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, EdgeCore may be susceptible to a
DoS attack on CloudHub if an attacker was to send a well-crafted HTTP
request to `/edge.crt`. If an attacker can send a well-crafted HTTP
request to CloudHub, and that request has a very large body, that
request can crash the HTTP service through a memory exhaustion vector.
The request body is being read into memory, and a body that is larger
than the available memory can lead to a successful attack. Because the
request would have to make it through authorization, only authorized
users may perform this attack. The consequence of the exhaustion is
that CloudHub will be in denial of service. KubeEdge is affected only
when users enable the CloudHub module in the file `cloudcore.yaml`.
This bug has been fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4. As a
workaround, disable the CloudHub switch in the config file
`cloudcore.yaml`.

KubeEdge is built upon Kubernetes and extends native containerized
application orchestration and device management to hosts at the Edge.
In affected versions a malicious message can crash CloudCore by
triggering a nil-pointer dereference in the UDS Server. Since the UDS
Server only communicates with the CSI Driver on the cloud side, the
attack is limited to the local host network. As such, an attacker
would already need to be an authenticated user of the Cloud.
Additionally it will be affected only when users turn on the
unixsocket switch in the config file cloudcore.yaml. This bug has been
fixed in Kubeedge 1.11.0, 1.10.1, and 1.9.3. Users should update to
these versions to resolve the issue. Users unable to upgrade should
sisable the unixsocket switch of CloudHub in the config file
cloudcore.yaml.

KubeEdge is an open source system for extending native containerized
application orchestration capabilities to hosts at Edge. Prior to
versions 1.11.1, 1.10.2, and 1.9.4, the CloudCore Router does not
impose a limit on the size of responses to requests made by the REST
handler. An attacker could use this weakness to make a request that
will return an HTTP response with a large body and cause DoS of
CloudCore. In the HTTP Handler API, the rest handler makes a request
to a pre-specified handle. The handle will return an HTTP response
that is then read into memory. The consequence of the exhaustion is
that CloudCore will be in a denial of service. Only an authenticated
user of the cloud can make an attack. It will be affected only when
users enable `router` module in the config file `cloudcore.yaml`. This

HTTP::Daemon is a simple http server class written in perl. Versions
prior to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially
be exploited to gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate
caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are, most Perl based
applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache, not on the
`HTTP::Daemon`. This library is commonly used for local development
and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users
unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a
mitigation. After calling `my $rqst = $conn->get_request()` one could
inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object. Querying the 'Content-
Length' (`my $cl = $rqst->header('Content-Length')`) will show any
abnormalities that should be dealt with by a `400` response. Expected
strings of 'Content-Length' SHOULD consist of either a single non-
negative integer, or, a comma separated repetition of that number.
(that is `42` or `42, 42, 42`). Anything else MUST be rejected.

Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any
infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 4.10.11 and
5.2.2, the certificate in the Parse Server Apple Game Center auth
adapter not validated. As a result, authentication could potentially
be bypassed by making a fake certificate accessible via certain Apple
domains and providing the URL to that certificate in an authData
object. Versions 4.0.11 and 5.2.2 prevent this by introducing a new
`rootCertificateUrl` property to the Parse Server Apple Game Center
auth adapter which takes the URL to the root certificate of Apple's
Game Center authentication certificate. If no value is set, the
`rootCertificateUrl` property defaults to the URL of the current root
certificate as of May 27, 2022. Keep in mind that the root certificate
can change at any time and that it is the developer's responsibility
to keep the root certificate URL up-to-date when using the Parse
Server Apple Game Center auth adapter. There are no known workarounds
for this issue.

Guzzle, an extensible PHP HTTP client. `Authorization` headers on
requests are sensitive information. In affected versions when using
our Curl handler, it is possible to use the `CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option
to specify an `Authorization` header. On making a request which
responds with a redirect to a URI with a different origin (change in
host, scheme or port), if we choose to follow it, we should remove the
`CURLOPT_HTTPAUTH` option before continuing, stopping curl from
appending the `Authorization` header to the new request. Affected
Guzzle 7 users should upgrade to Guzzle 7.4.5 as soon as possible.
Affected users using any earlier series of Guzzle should upgrade to
Guzzle 6.5.8 or 7.4.5. Note that a partial fix was implemented in
Guzzle 7.4.2, where a change in host would trigger removal of the
curl-added Authorization header, however this earlier fix did not
cover change in scheme or change in port. If you do not require or
expect redirects to be followed, one should simply disable redirects
all together. Alternatively, one can specify to use the Guzzle steam
handler backend, rather than curl.

Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform.
Pimcore offers developers listing classes to make querying data
easier. This listing classes also allow to order or group the results
based on one or more columns which should be quoted by default. The
actual issue is that quoting is not done properly in both cases, so
there's the theoretical possibility to inject custom SQL if the
developer is using this methods with input data and not doing proper
input validation in advance and so relies on the auto-quoting being
done by the listing classes. This issue has been resolved in version
10.4.4. Users are advised to upgrade or to apple the patch manually.
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for
Next.js applications. In affected versions an attacker can send a
request to an app using NextAuth.js with an invalid `callbackUrl`
query parameter, which internally is converted to a `URL` object. The
URL instantiation would fail due to a malformed URL being passed into
the constructor, causing it to throw an unhandled error which led to
the **API route handler timing out and logging in to fail**. This has
been remedied in versions 3.29.5 and 4.5.0. If for some reason you
cannot upgrade, the workaround requires you to rely on Advanced
Initialization. Please see the documentation for more.

Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who
want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise.
A vulnerability in the logging of Weave GitOps could allow an
authenticated remote attacker to view sensitive cluster
configurations, aka KubeConfg, of registered Kubernetes clusters,
including the service account tokens in plain text from Weave GitOps's
pod logs on the management cluster. An unauthorized remote attacker
can also view these sensitive configurations from external log storage
if enabled by the management cluster. This vulnerability is due to the
client factory dumping cluster configurations and their service
account tokens when the cluster manager tries to connect to an API
server of a registered cluster, and a connection error occurs. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by either accessing logs of
a pod of Weave GitOps, or from external log storage and obtaining all
cluster configurations of registered clusters. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to use those cluster configurations to manage
the registered Kubernetes clusters. This vulnerability has been fixed
by commit 567356f471353fb5c676c77f5abc2a04631d50ca. Users should
upgrade to Weave GitOps core version v0.8.1-rc.6 or newer. There is no
known workaround for this vulnerability.

untrusted rulex expressions, rulex may crash, possibly enabling a
Denial of Service attack. This happens when the expression contains a

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with 2.3.0 and prior to 2.3.6 and 2.4.5
is vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug which could allow an
attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript in the `/auth/callback` page
in a victim's browser. This vulnerability only affects Argo CD
instances which have single sign on (SSO) enabled. The exploit also
assumes the attacker has 1) access to the API server's encryption key,
2) a method to add a cookie to the victim's browser, and 3) the
ability to convince the victim to visit a malicious `/auth/callback`
link. The vulnerability is classified as low severity because access
to the API server's encryption key already grants a high level of
access. Exploiting the XSS would allow the attacker to impersonate the
victim, but would not grant any privileges which the attacker could
not otherwise gain using the encryption key. A patch for this
vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD versions
2.4.5 and 2.3.6. There is currently no known workaround.

Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. In affected versions
wasmtime's implementation of the SIMD proposal for WebAssembly on
x86_64 contained two distinct bugs in the instruction lowerings
implemented in Cranelift. The aarch64 implementation of the simd
proposal is not affected. The bugs were presented in the
`i8x16.swizzle` and `select` WebAssembly instructions. The `select`
instruction is only affected when the inputs are of `v128` type. The
correspondingly affected Cranelift instructions were `swizzle` and
`select`. The `swizzle` instruction lowering in Cranelift erroneously
overwrote the mask input register which could corrupt a constant
value, for example. This means that future uses of the same constant
may see a different value than the constant itself. The `select`
instruction lowering in Cranelift wasn't correctly implemented for
vector types that are 128-bits wide. When the condition was 0 the
wrong instruction was used to move the correct input to the output of
the instruction meaning that only the low 32 bits were moved and the
upper 96 bits of the result were left as whatever the register
previously contained (instead of the input being moved from). The
`select` instruction worked correctly if the condition was nonzero,
however. This bug in Wasmtime's implementation of these instructions
on x86_64 represents an incorrect implementation of the specified
semantics of these instructions according to the WebAssembly
specification. The impact of this is benign for hosts running
WebAssembly but represents possible vulnerabilities within the
execution of a guest program. For example a WebAssembly program could
take unintended branches or materialize incorrect values internally
which runs the risk of exposing the program itself to other related
vulnerabilities which can occur from miscompilations. We have released
Wasmtime 0.38.1 and cranelift-codegen (and other associated cranelift
crates) 0.85.1 which contain the corrected implementations of these
two instructions in Cranelift. If upgrading is not an option for you
at this time, you can avoid the vulnerability by disabling the Wasm
simd proposal. Additionally the bug is only present on x86_64 hosts.
Other aarch64 hosts are not affected. Note that s390x hosts don't yet
implement the simd proposal and are not affected.

available. Those who use an external OIDC provider (not the bundled
Dex instance), can mitigate the issue by setting the
`oidc.config.rootCA` field in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap. This
mitigation only forces certificate validation when the API server
handles login flows. It does not force certificate verification when
verifying tokens on API calls.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
In versions 5.3 until 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and 8.3.10, it is possible
for a malicious user who has authorization to log into a Grafana
instance via a configured OAuth IdP which provides a login name to
take over the account of another user in that Grafana instance. This
can occur when the malicious user is authorized to log in to Grafana
via OAuth, the malicious user's external user id is not already
associated with an account in Grafana, the malicious user's email
address is not already associated with an account in Grafana, and the
malicious user knows the Grafana username of the target user. If these
conditions are met, the malicious user can set their username in the
OAuth provider to that of the target user, then go through the OAuth
flow to log in to Grafana. Due to the way that external and internal
user accounts are linked together during login, if the conditions
above are all met then the malicious user will be able to log in to
the target user's Grafana account. Versions 9.0.3, 8.5.9, 8.4.10, and
8.3.10 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, concerned
users can disable OAuth login to their Grafana instance, or ensure
that all users authorized to log in via OAuth have a corresponding
user account in Grafana linked to their email address.

Mermaid is a JavaScript based diagramming and charting tool that uses
Markdown-inspired text definitions and a renderer to create and modify
complex diagrams. An attacker is able to inject arbitrary `CSS` into
the generated graph allowing them to change the styling of elements
outside of the generated graph, and potentially exfiltrate sensitive
information by using specially crafted `CSS` selectors. The following
example shows how an attacker can exfiltrate the contents of an input
field by bruteforcing the `value` attribute one character at a time.
Whenever there is an actual match, an `http` request will be made by
the browser in order to "load" a background image that will let an
attacker know what's the value of the character. This issue may lead
to `Information Disclosure` via CSS selectors and functions able to
generate HTTP requests. This also allows an attacker to change the
document in ways which may lead a user to perform unintended actions,
such as clicking on a link, etc. This issue has been resolved in
version 9.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
should ensure that user input is adequately escaped before embedding
it in CSS blocks.

Reference: URL:https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header

laminas-diactoros is a PHP package containing implementations of the
PSR-7 HTTP message interfaces and PSR-17 HTTP message factory
interfaces. Applications that use Diactoros, and are either not behind
a proxy, or can be accessed via untrusted proxies, can potentially
have the host, protocol, and/or port of a `Laminas\Diactoros\Uri`
instance associated with the incoming server request modified to
reflect values from `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Such changes can
potentially lead to XSS attacks (if a fully-qualified URL is used in
links) and/or URL poisoning. Since the `X-Forwarded-*` headers do have
valid use cases, particularly in clustered environments using a load
balancer, the library offers mitigation measures only in the v2
releases, as doing otherwise would break these use cases immediately.
Users of v2 releases from 2.11.1 can provide an additional argument to
`Laminas\Diactoros\ServerRequestFactory::fromGlobals()` in the form of
a `Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\RequestFilterInterface` instance,
including the shipped
`Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\NoOpRequestFilter` implementation
which ignores the `X-Forwarded-*` headers. Starting in version 3.0,
the library will reverse behavior to use the `NoOpRequestFilter` by
default, and require users to opt-in to `X-Forwarded-*` header usage
via a configured
`Laminas\Diactoros\RequestFilter\LegacyXForwardedHeaderFilter`
instance. Users are advised to upgrade to version 2.11.1 or later to
resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may configure web servers
to reject `X-Forwarded-*` headers at the web server level.

Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. In affected
versions the truncation done when converting between EVM balance type
and Substrate balance type was incorrectly implemented. This leads to
possible discrepancy between appeared EVM transfer value and actual
Substrate value transferred. It is recommended that an emergency
upgrade to be planned and EVM execution temporarily paused in the mean
time. The issue is patched in Frontier master branch commit
fed5e0a9577c10bea021721e8c2c5c378e16bf66 and polkadot-v0.9.22 branch
commit e3e427fa2e5d1200a784679f8015d4774cedc934. This vulnerability
affects only EVM internal states, but not Substrate balance states or
node. You can temporarily pause EVM execution (by setting up a
Substrate `CallFilter` that disables `pallet-evm` and `pallet-
ethereum` calls before the patch can be applied.

Canarytokens is an open source tool which helps track activity and
actions on your network. A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was
identified in the history page of triggered Canarytokens. This permits
an attacker who recognised an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL) to
execute Javascript in the Canarytoken's history page (domain:
canarytokens.org) when the history page is later visited by the
Canarytoken's creator. This vulnerability could be used to disable or
delete the affected Canarytoken, or view its activation history. It
might also be used as a stepping stone towards revealing more
information about the Canarytoken's creator to the attacker. For
example, an attacker could recover the email address tied to the
Canarytoken, or place Javascript on the history page that redirect the
creator towards an attacker-controlled Canarytoken to show the
creator's network location. An attacker could only act on the
discovered Canarytoken. This issue did not expose other Canarytokens
or other Canarytoken creators. The issue has been patched on
Canarytokens.org and in the latest release. No signs of successful
exploitation of this vulnerability have been found. Users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

UltraJSON is a fast JSON encoder and decoder written in pure C with
bindings for Python 3.7+. Affected versions were found to improperly
decode certain characters. JSON strings that contain escaped surrogate
characters not part of a proper surrogate pair were decoded
incorrectly. Besides corrupting strings, this allowed for potential
key confusion and value overwriting in dictionaries. All users parsing
JSON from untrusted sources are vulnerable. From version 5.4.0,
UltraJSON decodes lone surrogates in the same way as the standard
library's `json` module does, preserving them in the parsed output.
Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this

Wire is an encrypted communication and collaboration platform.
Versions prior to 2022-07-12/Chart 4.19.0 are subject to Token
Recipient Confusion. If an attacker has certain details of SAML IdP
metadata, and configures their own SAML on the same backend, the
attacker can delete all SAML authenticated accounts of a targeted
team, Authenticate as a user of the attacked team and create arbitrary
accounts in the context of the team if it is not managed by SCIM. This
issue is fixed in wire-server 2022-07-12 and is already deployed on
all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-server need to
be updated to 2022-07-12/Chart 4.19.0, so that their backends are no
longer affected. As a workaround, the risk of an attack can be reduced
by disabling SAML configuration for teams
(galley.config.settings.featureFlags.sso). Helm overrides are located
in `values/wire-server/values.yaml` Note that the ability to configure
SAML SSO as a team is disabled by default for on-premise
installations.

Grafana is an open source observability and data visualization
platform. Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 are vulnerable to a
bypass in the plugin signature verification. An attacker can convince
a server admin to download and successfully run a malicious plugin
even though unsigned plugins are not allowed. Versions 9.1.8 and
8.5.14 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, do not install
plugins downloaded from untrusted sources.

openssh_key_parser is an open source Python package providing
utilities to parse and pack OpenSSH private and public key files. In
versions prior to 0.0.6 if a field of a key is shorter than it is
declared to be, the parser raises an error with a message containing
the raw field value. An attacker able to modify the declared length of
a key's sensitive field can thus expose the raw value of that field.
Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.0.6, which no longer
includes the raw field value in the error message. There are no known
workarounds for this issue.

NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for
Next.js applications. An attacker can pass a compromised input to the
e-mail [signin endpoint](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-
started/rest-api#post-apiauthsigninprovider) that contains some
malicious HTML, tricking the e-mail server to send it to the user, so
they can perform a phishing attack. Eg.: `balazs@email.com, <a
href="http://attacker.com">Before signing in, claim your money!</a>`.
This was previously sent to `balazs@email.com`, and the content of the
email containing a link to the attacker's site was rendered in the
HTML. This has been remedied in the following releases, by simply not
rendering that e-mail in the HTML, since it should be obvious to the
receiver what e-mail they used: next-auth v3 users before version
3.29.8 are impacted. (We recommend upgrading to v4, as v3 is
considered unmaintained. next-auth v4 users before version 4.9.0 are
impacted. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, the workaround
requires you to sanitize the `email` parameter that is passed to
`sendVerificationRequest` and rendered in the HTML. If you haven't
created a custom `sendVerificationRequest`, you only need to upgrade.
Otherwise, make sure to either exclude `email` from the HTML body or
efficiently sanitize it.

moment is a JavaScript date library for parsing, validating,
manipulating, and formatting dates. Affected versions of moment were
found to use an inefficient parsing algorithm. Specifically using
string-to-date parsing in moment (more specifically rfc2822 parsing,
which is tried by default) has quadratic (N^2) complexity on specific
inputs. Users may notice a noticeable slowdown is observed with inputs
above 10k characters. Users who pass user-provided strings without
sanity length checks to moment constructor are vulnerable to (Re)DoS
attacks. The problem is patched in 2.29.4, the patch can be applied to
all affected versions with minimal tweaking. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should consider limiting date lengths
accepted from user input.

UnsafeAccessor (UA) is a bridge to access jdk.internal.misc.Unsafe &
sun.misc.Unsafe. Normally, if UA is loaded as a named module, the
internal data of UA is protected by JVM and others can only access UA
via UA's standard API. The main application can set up
`SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` for UA to limit access to UA. Starting
with version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.7.0, when
`SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is set up, untrusted code can access UA
without limitation, even when UA is loaded as a named module. This
issue does not affect those for whom `SecurityCheck.AccessLimiter` is
not set up. Version 1.7.0 contains a patch.

@fastify/bearer-auth is a Fastify plugin to require bearer
Authorization headers. @fastify/bearer-auth prior to versions 7.0.2
and 8.0.1 does not securely use crypto.timingSafeEqual. A malicious
attacker could estimate the length of one valid bearer token.
According to the corresponding RFC 6750, the bearer token has only
base64 valid characters, reducing the range of characters for a brute
force attack. Version 7.0.2 and 8.0.1 of @fastify/bearer-auth contain
a patch. There are currently no known workarounds. The package
fastify-bearer-auth, which covers versions 6.0.3 and prior, is also
vulnerable starting at version 5.0.1. Users of fastify-bearer-auth
should upgrade to a patched version of @fastify/bearer-auth.

Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. There is a bug in
the Wasmtime's code generator, Cranelift, where functions using
reference types may be incorrectly missing metadata required for
runtime garbage collection. This means that if a GC happens at runtime
then the GC pass will mistakenly think these functions do not have
live references to GC'd values, reclaiming them and deallocating them.
The function will then subsequently continue to use the values
assuming they had not been GC'd, leading later to a use-after-free.
This bug was introduced in the migration to the `regalloc2` register
allocator that occurred in the Wasmtime 0.37.0 release on 2022-05-20.
This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime version
0.38.2. Mitigations for this issue can be achieved by disabling the
reference types proposal by passing `false` to
`wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types` or downgrading to Wasmtime
0.36.0 or prior.

could craft events which would be accepted by Synapse but not a spec-
conformant server, potentially causing divergence in the room state
between servers. Administrators of homeservers with federation enabled

Gradle is a build tool. Dependency verification is a security feature
in Gradle Build Tool that was introduced to allow validation of
external dependencies either through their checksum or cryptographic
signatures. In versions 6.2 through 7.4.2, there are some cases in
which Gradle may skip that verification and accept a dependency that
would otherwise fail the build as an untrusted external artifact. This
can occur in two ways. When signature verification is disabled but the
verification metadata contains entries for dependencies that only have
a `gpg` element but no `checksum` element. When signature verification
is enabled, the verification metadata contains entries for
dependencies with a `gpg` element but there is no signature file on
the remote repository. In both cases, the verification will accept the
dependency, skipping signature verification and not complaining that
the dependency has no checksum entry. For builds that are vulnerable,
there are two risks. Gradle could download a malicious binary from a
repository outside your organization due to name squatting. For those
still using HTTP only and not HTTPS for downloading dependencies, the
build could download a malicious library instead of the expected one.
Gradle 7.5 patches this issue by making sure to run checksum
verification if signature verification cannot be completed, whatever
the reason. Two workarounds are available: Remove all `gpg` elements
from dependency verification metadata if you disable signature
validation and/or avoid adding `gpg` entries for dependencies that do
not have signature files.

The AWS SDK for Java enables Java developers to work with Amazon Web
Services. A partial-path traversal issue exists within the
`downloadDirectory` method in the AWS S3 TransferManager component of
the AWS SDK for Java v1 prior to version 1.12.261. Applications using
the SDK control the `destinationDirectory` argument, but S3 object
keys are determined by the application that uploaded the objects. The
`downloadDirectory` method allows the caller to pass a filesystem
object in the object key but contained an issue in the validation
logic for the key name. A knowledgeable actor could bypass the
validation logic by including a UNIX double-dot in the bucket key.
Under certain conditions, this could permit them to retrieve a
directory from their S3 bucket that is one level up in the filesystem
from their working directory. This issue&#8217;s scope is limited to
directories whose name prefix matches the destinationDirectory. E.g.
for destination directory`/tmp/foo`, the actor can cause a download to
`/tmp/foo-bar`, but not `/tmp/bar`. If `com.amazonaws.services.s3.tran
sfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory` is used to download an
untrusted buckets contents, the contents of that bucket can be written
outside of the intended destination directory. Version 1.12.261
contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, when calling `com.am
azonaws.services.s3.transfer.TransferManager::downloadDirectory`, pass
a `KeyFilter` that forbids `S3ObjectSummary` objects that `getKey`
method return a string containing the substring `..` .

jQuery UI is a curated set of user interface interactions, effects,
widgets, and themes built on top of jQuery. Versions prior to 1.13.2
are potentially vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Initializing a
checkboxradio widget on an input enclosed within a label makes that
parent label contents considered as the input label. Calling
`.checkboxradio( "refresh" )` on such a widget and the initial HTML
contained encoded HTML entities will make them erroneously get
decoded. This can lead to potentially executing JavaScript code. The
bug has been patched in jQuery UI 1.13.2. To remediate the issue,
someone who can change the initial HTML can wrap all the non-input
contents of the `label` in a `span`.

TZInfo is a Ruby library that provides access to time zone data and
allows times to be converted using time zone rules. Versions prior to
0.36.1, as well as those prior to 1.2.10 when used with the Ruby data
source tzinfo-data, are vulnerable to relative path traversal. With
the Ruby data source, time zones are defined in Ruby files. There is
one file per time zone. Time zone files are loaded with `require` on
demand. In the affected versions, `TZInfo::Timezone.get` fails to
validate time zone identifiers correctly, allowing a new line
character within the identifier. With Ruby version 1.9.3 and later,
`TZInfo::Timezone.get` can be made to load unintended files with
`require`, executing them within the Ruby process. Versions 0.3.61 and
1.2.10 include fixes to correctly validate time zone identifiers.
Versions 2.0.0 and later are not vulnerable. Version 0.3.61 can still
load arbitrary files from the Ruby load path if their name follows the
rules for a valid time zone identifier and the file has a prefix of
`tzinfo/definition` within a directory in the load path. Applications
should ensure that untrusted files are not placed in a directory on
the load path. As a workaround, the time zone identifier can be
validated before passing to `TZInfo::Timezone.get` by ensuring it
matches the regular expression
`\A[A-Za-z0-9+\-_]+(?:\/[A-Za-z0-9+\-_]+)*\z`.

XWiki Platform Old Core is a core package for XWiki Platform, a
generic wiki platform. Starting in versions 11.3.7, 11.0.3, and
12.0RC1, it is possible to exploit a bug in XWikiRights resolution of
groups to obtain privilege escalation. More specifically, editing a
right with the object editor leads to adding a supplementary empty
value to groups which is then resolved as a reference to XWiki.WebHome
page. Adding an XWikiGroup xobject to that page then transforms it to
a group, any user put in that group would then obtain the privileges
related to the edited right. Note that this security issue is normally
mitigated by the fact that XWiki.WebHome (and XWiki space in general)
should be protected by default for edit rights. The problem has been
patched in XWiki 13.10.4 and 14.2RC1 to not consider anymore empty
values in XWikiRights. It's possible to work around the problem by
setting appropriate rights on XWiki.WebHome page to prevent users to
edit it.

Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. There is a bug in
Wasmtime's code generator, Cranelift, for AArch64 targets where
constant divisors can result in incorrect division results at runtime.
This affects Wasmtime prior to version 0.38.2 and Cranelift prior to
0.85.2. This issue only affects the AArch64 platform. Other platforms
are not affected. The translation rules for constants did not take
into account whether sign or zero-extension should happen which
resulted in an incorrect value being placed into a register when a
division was encountered. The impact of this bug is that programs
executing within the WebAssembly sandbox would not behave according to
the WebAssembly specification. This means that it is hypothetically
possible for execution within the sandbox to go awry and WebAssembly
programs could produce unexpected results. This should not impact
hosts executing WebAssembly but does affect the correctness of guest
programs. This bug has been patched in Wasmtime version 0.38.2 and
cranelift-codegen 0.85.2. There are no known workarounds.

CKEditor 5 is a JavaScript rich text editor. A cross-site scripting
vulnerability has been discovered affecting three optional CKEditor
5's packages in versions prior to 35.0.1. The vulnerability allowed to
trigger a JavaScript code after fulfilling special conditions. The
affected packages are `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-markdown-gfm`,
`@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-support`, and `@ckeditor/ckeditor5-html-
embed`. The specific conditions are 1) Using one of the affected
packages. In case of `ckeditor5-html-support` and `ckeditor5-html-
embed`, additionally, it was required to use a configuration that
allows unsafe markup inside the editor. 2) Destroying the editor
instance and 3) Initializing the editor on an element and using an
element other than `<textarea>` as a base. The root cause of the issue
was a mechanism responsible for updating the source element with the
markup coming from the CKEditor 5 data pipeline after destroying the
editor. This vulnerability might affect a small percent of integrators
that depend on dynamic editor initialization/destroy and use Markdown,
General HTML Support or HTML embed features. The problem has been
recognized and patched. The fix is available in version 35.0.1. There
are no known workarounds for this issue.

This impacts users that use Shescape (any API function) to escape
arguments for cmd.exe on Windows An attacker can omit all arguments
following their input by including a line feed character (`'\n'`) in
the payload. This bug has been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can
upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Alternatively, line
feed characters (`'\n'`) can be stripped out manually or the user
input can be made the last argument (this only limits the impact).

Shescape is a simple shell escape package for JavaScript. Affected
versions were found to have insufficient escaping of white space when
interpolating output. This issue only impacts users that use the
`escape` or `escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set
to `true`. The result is that if an attacker is able to include
whitespace in their input they can: 1. Invoke shell-specific behaviour
through shell-specific special characters inserted directly after
whitespace. 2. Invoke shell-specific behaviour through shell-specific
special characters inserted or appearing after line terminating
characters. 3. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a line feed
character. 4. Invoke arbitrary commands by inserting a carriage return
character. Behaviour number 1 has been patched in [v1.5.7] which you
can upgrade to now. No further changes are required. Behaviour number
2, 3, and 4 have been patched in [v1.5.8] which you can upgrade to
now. No further changes are required. The best workaround is to avoid
having to use the `interpolation: true` option - in most cases using
an alternative is possible, see [the
recipes](https://github.com/ericcornelissen/shescape#recipes) for
recommendations. Alternatively, users may strip all whitespace from
user input. Note that this is error prone, for example: for PowerShell
this requires stripping `'\u0085'` which is not included in
JavaScript's definition of `\s` for Regular Expressions.

fs2 is a compositional, streaming I/O library for Scala. When
establishing a server-mode `TLSSocket` using `fs2-io` on Node.js, the
parameter `requestCert = true` is ignored, peer certificate
verification is skipped, and the connection proceeds. The
vulnerability is limited to: 1. `fs2-io` running on Node.js. The JVM
TLS implementation is completely independent. 2. `TLSSocket`s in
server-mode. Client-mode `TLSSocket`s are implemented via a different
API. 3. mTLS as enabled via `requestCert = true` in `TLSParameters`.
The default setting is `false` for server-mode `TLSSocket`s. It was
introduced with the initial Node.js implementation of fs2-io in 3.1.0.
A patch is released in v3.2.11. The requestCert = true parameter is
respected and the peer certificate is verified. If verification fails,
a SSLException is raised. If using an unpatched version on Node.js, do
not use a server-mode TLSSocket with requestCert = true to establish a
mTLS connection.

NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for
Next.js applications. An information disclosure vulnerability in
`next-auth` before `v4.10.2` and `v3.29.9` allows an attacker with log
access privilege to obtain excessive information such as an identity
provider's secret in the log (which is thrown during OAuth error
handling) and use it to leverage further attacks on the system, like
impersonating the client to ask for extensive permissions. This issue
has been patched in `v4.10.2` and `v3.29.9` by moving the log for
`provider` information to the debug level. In addition, we added a
warning for having the `debug: true` option turned on in production.
If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can user the `logger`
configuration option by sanitizing the logs.

DSpace open source software is a repository application which provides
durable access to digital resources. In affected versions the
ItemImportServiceImpl is vulnerable to a path traversal vulnerability.
This means a malicious SAF (simple archive format) package could cause
a file/directory to be created anywhere the Tomcat/DSpace user can
write to on the server. However, this path traversal vulnerability is
only possible by a user with special privileges (either Administrators
or someone with command-line access to the server). This vulnerability
impacts the XMLUI, JSPUI and command-line. Users are advised to
upgrade. As a basic workaround, users may block all access to the
following URL paths: If you are using the XMLUI, block all access to
/admin/batchimport path (this is the URL of the Admin Batch Import
tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses the path "/xmlui", then you'd
need to block access to /xmlui/admin/batchimport. If you are using the
JSPUI, block all access to /dspace-admin/batchimport path (this is the
URL of the Admin Batch Import tool). Keep in mind, if your site uses
the path "/jspui", then you'd need to block access to /jspui/dspace-
admin/batchimport. Keep in mind, only an Administrative user or a user
with command-line access to the server is able to import/upload SAF
packages. Therefore, assuming those users do not blindly upload
untrusted SAF packages, then it is unlikely your site could be
impacted by this vulnerability.

Databasir is a database metadata management platform. Databasir <=
1.06 has Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. The SSRF is
triggered by a sending a **single** HTTP POST request to create a
databaseType. By supplying a `jdbcDriverFileUrl` that returns a non

PostgreSQL JDBC Driver (PgJDBC for short) allows Java programs to
connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database independent
Java code. The PGJDBC implementation of the
`java.sql.ResultRow.refreshRow()` method is not performing escaping of
column names so a malicious column name that contains a statement
terminator, e.g. `;`, could lead to SQL injection. This could lead to
executing additional SQL commands as the application's JDBC user. User
applications that do not invoke the `ResultSet.refreshRow()` method
are not impacted. User application that do invoke that method are
impacted if the underlying database that they are querying via their
JDBC application may be under the control of an attacker. The attack
requires the attacker to trick the user into executing SQL against a
table name who's column names would contain the malicious SQL and
subsequently invoke the `refreshRow()` method on the ResultSet. Note
that the application's JDBC user and the schema owner need not be the
same. A JDBC application that executes as a privileged user querying
database schemas owned by potentially malicious less-privileged users
would be vulnerable. In that situation it may be possible for the
malicious user to craft a schema that causes the application to
execute commands as the privileged user. Patched versions will be
released as `42.2.26` and `42.4.1`. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract
development. This issue concerns instances of Governor that use the
module `GovernorVotesQuorumFraction`, a mechanism that determines
quorum requirements as a percentage of the voting token's total
supply. In affected instances, when a proposal is passed to lower the
quorum requirements, past proposals may become executable if they had
been defeated only due to lack of quorum, and the number of votes it
received meets the new quorum requirement. Analysis of instances on
chain found only one proposal that met this condition, and we are
actively monitoring for new occurrences of this particular issue. This
issue has been patched in v4.7.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
unable to upgrade should consider avoiding lowering quorum
requirements if a past proposal was defeated for lack of quorum.

The Omron SYSMAC Nx product family PLCs (NJ series, NY series, NX
series, and PMAC series) through 2022-005-18 lack cryptographic
authentication. These PLCs are programmed using the SYMAC Studio
engineering software (which compiles IEC 61131-3 conformant POU code
to native machine code for execution by the PLC's runtime). The
resulting machine code is executed by a runtime, typically controlled
by a real-time operating system. The logic that is downloaded to the
PLC does not seem to be cryptographically authenticated, allowing an
attacker to manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and execute
arbitrary machine code on the processor of the PLC's CPU module in the
context of the runtime. In the case of at least the NJ series, an RTOS
and hardware combination is used that would potentially allow for
memory protection and privilege separation and thus limit the impact
of code execution. However, it was not confirmed whether these
sufficiently segment the runtime from the rest of the RTOS.

The Omron SYSMAC Cx product family PLCs (CS series, CJ series, and CP
series) through 2022-05-18 lack cryptographic authentication. They
utilize the Omron FINS (9600/TCP) protocol for engineering purposes,
including downloading projects and control logic to the PLC. This
protocol has authentication flaws as reported in FSCT-2022-0057.
Control logic is downloaded to PLC volatile memory using the FINS
Program Area Read and Program Area Write commands or to non-volatile
memory using other commands from where it can be loaded into volatile
memory for execution. The logic that is loaded into and executed from
the user program area exists in compiled object code form. Upon
execution, these object codes are first passed to a dedicated ASIC
that determines whether the object code is to be executed by the ASIC
or the microprocessor. In the former case, the object code is
interpreted by the ASIC whereas in the latter case the object code is
passed to the microprocessor for object code interpretation by a ROM
interpreter. In the abnormal case where the object code cannot be
handled by either, an abnormal condition is triggered and the PLC is
halted. The logic that is downloaded to the PLC does not seem to be
cryptographically authenticated, thus allowing an attacker to
manipulate transmitted object code to the PLC and either execute
arbitrary object code commands on the ASIC or on the microprocessor
interpreter.

access on the device can monitor all communications sent to and from
this device, modify onboard relays, change configuration files, or
cause the device to become unstable. The injected commands only get
executed during start up or when unsafe calls regarding the hostname
are used. This allows the attacker to gain remote access to the device
and can make their persistence permanent by modifying the filesystem.

Spring Security, versions 5.7 prior to 5.7.5 and 5.6 prior to 5.6.9
could be susceptible to authorization rules bypass via forward or
include dispatcher types. Specifically, an application is vulnerable
when all of the following are true: The application expects that
Spring Security applies security to forward and include dispatcher
types. The application uses the AuthorizationFilter either manually or
via the authorizeHttpRequests() method. The application configures the
FilterChainProxy to apply to forward and/or include requests (e.g.
spring.security.filter.dispatcher-types = request, error, async,
forward, include). The application may forward or include the request
to a higher privilege-secured endpoint.The application configures
Spring Security to apply to every dispatcher type via
authorizeHttpRequests().shouldFilterAllDispatcherTypes(true)

There exists a use-after-free in io_uring in the Linux kernel.
Signalfd_poll() and binder_poll() use a waitqueue whose lifetime is
the current task. It will send a POLLFREE notification to all waiters
before the queue is freed. Unfortunately, the io_uring poll doesn't
handle POLLFREE. This allows a use-after-free to occur if a signalfd
or binder fd is polled with io_uring poll, and the waitqueue gets
freed. We recommend upgrading past commit

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/03/msg00024.html

A vulnerability named 'Non-Responsive Delegation Attack' (NRDelegation
Attack) has been discovered in various DNS resolving software. The
NRDelegation Attack works by having a malicious delegation with a
considerable number of non responsive nameservers. The attack starts
by querying a resolver for a record that relies on those unresponsive
nameservers. The attack can cause a resolver to spend a lot of
time/resources resolving records under a malicious delegation point
where a considerable number of unresponsive NS records reside. It can
trigger high CPU usage in some resolver implementations that
continually look in the cache for resolved NS records in that
delegation. This can lead to degraded performance and eventually
denial of service in orchestrated attacks. Unbound does not suffer
from high CPU usage, but resources are still needed for resolving the
malicious delegation. Unbound will keep trying to resolve the record
until hard limits are reached. Based on the nature of the attack and
the replies, different limits could be reached. From version 1.16.3
on, Unbound introduces fixes for better performance when under load,
by cutting opportunistic queries for nameserver discovery and DNSKEY
prefetching and limiting the number of times a delegation point can
issue a cache lookup for missing records.

New Assets function of Strapi 4.1.12 allows attackers to conduct XSS
attacks via a crafted PDF file. NOTE: the project documentation
suggests that a user with the Media Library "Create (upload)"
permission is supposed to be able to upload PDF files containing
JavaScript, and that all files in a public assets folder are
accessible to the outside world (unless the filename begins with a dot
character). The administrator can choose to allow only image, video,

NIOHTTP1 and projects using it for generating HTTP responses can be
subject to a HTTP Response Injection attack. This occurs when a
HTTP/1.1 server accepts user generated input from an incoming request
and reflects it into a HTTP/1.1 response header in some form. A
malicious user can add newlines to their input (usually in encoded
form) and "inject" those newlines into the returned HTTP response.
This capability allows users to work around security headers and
HTTP/1.1 framing headers by injecting entirely false responses or
other new headers. The injected false responses may also be treated as
the response to subsequent requests, which can lead to XSS, cache
poisoning, and a number of other flaws. This issue was resolved by
adding validation to the HTTPHeaders type, ensuring that there's no
whitespace incorrectly present in the HTTP headers provided by users.
As the existing API surface is non-failable, all invalid characters
are replaced by linear whitespace.

The httplib and urllib Python libraries that Splunk shipped with
Splunk Enterprise did not validate certificates using the certificate
authority (CA) certificate stores by default in Splunk Enterprise
versions before 9.0 and Splunk Cloud Platform versions before
8.2.2203. Python 3 client libraries now verify server certificates by
default and use the appropriate CA certificate stores for each
library. Apps and add-ons that include their own HTTP libraries are
not affected. For Splunk Enterprise, update to Splunk Enterprise
version 9.0 and Configure TLS host name validation for Splunk-to-
Splunk communications (https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/9.

In universal forwarder versions before 9.0, management services are
available remotely by default. When not required, it introduces a
potential exposure, but it is not a vulnerability. If exposed, we
recommend each customer assess the potential severity specific to your
environment. In 9.0, the universal forwarder now binds the management
port to localhost preventing remote logins by default. If management
services are not required in versions before 9.0, set
disableDefaultPort = true in server.conf OR allowRemoteLogin = never
in server.conf OR mgmtHostPort = localhost in web.conf. See Configure
universal forwarder management security (https://docs.splunk.com/Docum

In Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder versions before 9.0, the
Splunk command-line interface (CLI) did not validate TLS certificates
while connecting to a remote Splunk platform instance by default.
After updating to version 9.0, see Configure TLS host name validation

does not affect the Splunk Cloud Platform. At the time of publishing,
we have no evidence of exploitation of this vulnerability by external
parties. The issue requires conditions beyond the control of a
potential bad actor such as a machine-in-the-middle attack. Hence,
Splunk rates the complexity of the attack as High.

Splunk Enterprise deployment servers in versions before 9.0 allow
unauthenticated downloading of forwarder bundles. Remediation requires
you to update the deployment server to version 9.0 and Configure
authentication for deployment servers and clients (https://docs.splunk

nfigure_authentication_for_deployment_servers_and_clients). Once
enabled, deployment servers can manage only Universal Forwarder

affect Universal Forwarders, remediation requires updating all
Universal Forwarders that the deployment server manages to version 9.0
or higher prior to enabling the remediation.

A malicious server can serve excessive amounts of `Set-Cookie:`
headers in a HTTP response to curl and curl < 7.84.0 stores all of
them. A sufficiently large amount of (big) cookies make subsequent
HTTP requests to this, or other servers to which the cookies match,
create requests that become larger than the threshold that curl uses
internally to avoid sending crazy large requests (1048576 bytes) and
instead returns an error.This denial state might remain for as long as
the same cookies are kept, match and haven't expired. Due to cookie
matching rules, a server on `foo.example.com` can set cookies that
also would match for `bar.example.com`, making it it possible for a
"sister server" to effectively cause a denial of service for a sibling
site on the same second level domain using this method.

curl < 7.84.0 supports "chained" HTTP compression algorithms, meaning
that a serverresponse can be compressed multiple times and potentially
with different algorithms. The number of acceptable "links" in this
"decompression chain" was unbounded, allowing a malicious server to
insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps.The use of
such a decompression chain could result in a "malloc bomb", makingcurl
end up spending enormous amounts of allocated heap memory, or trying

When curl < 7.84.0 saves cookies, alt-svc and hsts data to local
files, it makes the operation atomic by finalizing the operation with
a rename from a temporary name to the final target file name.In that
rename operation, it might accidentally *widen* the permissions for
the target file, leaving the updated file accessible to more users
than intended.

# Possible XSS Vulnerability in Rails::Html::SanitizerThere is a
possible XSS vulnerability with certain configurations of
Rails::Html::Sanitizer.This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
identifier CVE-2022-32209.Versions Affected: ALLNot affected:
NONEFixed Versions: v1.4.3## ImpactA possible XSS vulnerability with
certain configurations of Rails::Html::Sanitizer may allow an attacker
to inject content if the application developer has overridden the
sanitizer's allowed tags to allow both `select` and `style`
elements.Code is only impacted if allowed tags are being overridden.
This may be done via application configuration:```ruby# In
config/application.rbconfig.action_view.sanitized_allowed_tags =
["select", "style"]```see
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/configuring.html#configuring-action-
viewOr it may be done with a `:tags` option to the Action View helper
`sanitize`:```<%= sanitize @comment.body, tags: ["select", "style"]
%>```see https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/Saniti
zeHelper.html#method-i-sanitizeOr it may be done with
Rails::Html::SafeListSanitizer directly:```ruby# class-level
optionRails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.allowed_tags = ["select",
"style"]```or```ruby# instance-level
optionRails::Html::SafeListSanitizer.new.sanitize(@article.body, tags:
["select", "style"])```All users overriding the allowed tags by any of
the above mechanisms to include both "select" and "style" should
either upgrade or use one of the workarounds immediately.##
ReleasesThe FIXED releases are available at the normal locations.##
WorkaroundsRemove either `select` or `style` from the overridden
allowed tags.## CreditsThis vulnerability was responsibly reported by

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/17/4

When doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read
callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when
the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle
previously was used to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback.
This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and
either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in
the subsequent `POST` request. The problem exists in the logic for a
reused handle when it is changed from a PUT to a POST.

Microsoft Windows SMBv3 suffers from a null pointer dereference in
versions of Windows prior to the April, 2022 patch set. By sending a
malformed FileNormalizedNameInformation SMBv3 request over a named
pipe, an attacker can cause a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) crash of the
Windows kernel. For most systems, this attack requires authentication,
except in the special case of Windows Domain Controllers, where
unauthenticated users can always open named pipes as long as they can
establish an SMB session. Typically, after the BSOD, the victim SMBv3
server will reboot.

Name: CVE-2022-32290
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://mender.io/blog/cve-2022-32290-mender-client-listening-on-all-the-interfaces
Reference: MISC:https://northern.tech

The client in Northern.tech Mender 3.2.0, 3.2.1, and 3.2.2 has
Incorrect Access Control. It listens on a random, unprivileged TCP
port and exposes an HTTP proxy to facilitate API calls from additional
client components running on the device. However, it listens on all
network interfaces instead of only the localhost interface. Therefore,
any client on the same network can connect to this TCP port and send
HTTP requests. The Mender Client will forward these requests to the
Mender Server. Additionally, if mTLS is set up, the Mender Client will
connect to the Mender Server using the device's client certificate,
making it possible for the attacker to bypass mTLS authentication and
send requests to the Mender Server without direct access to the client
certificate and related private key. Accessing the HTTP proxy from the
local network doesn't represent a direct threat, because it doesn't
expose any device or server-specific data. However, it increases the
attack surface and can be a potential vector to exploit other
vulnerabilities both on the Client and the Server.

Improper detection of complete HTTP body decompression SwiftNIO Extras
provides a pair of helpers for transparently decompressing received
HTTP request or response bodies. These two objects
(HTTPRequestDecompressor and HTTPResponseDecompressor) both failed to
detect when the decompressed body was considered complete. If trailing
junk data was appended to the HTTP message body, the code would
repeatedly attempt to decompress this data and fail. This would lead
to an infinite loop making no forward progress, leading to livelock of
the system and denial-of-service. This issue can be triggered by any
attacker capable of sending a compressed HTTP message. Most commonly
this is HTTP servers, as compressed HTTP messages cannot be negotiated
for HTTP requests, but it is possible that users have configured
decompression for HTTP requests as well. The attack is low effort, and
likely to be reached without requiring any privilege or system access.
The impact on availability is high: the process immediately becomes
unavailable but does not immediately crash, meaning that it is
possible for the process to remain in this state until an
administrator intervenes or an automated circuit breaker fires. If
left unchecked this issue will very slowly exhaust memory resources
due to repeated buffer allocation, but the buffers are not written to
and so it is possible that the processes will not terminate for quite
some time. This risk can be mitigated by removing transparent HTTP
message decompression. The issue is fixed by correctly detecting the
termination of the compressed body as reported by zlib and refusing to
decompress further data. The issue was found by Vojtech Rylko
(https://github.com/vojtarylko) and reported publicly on GitHub.

Users may have access to secure endpoints in the control plane
network. Kubernetes clusters are only affected if an untrusted user
can modify Node objects and send proxy requests to them. Kubernetes
supports node proxying, which allows clients of kube-apiserver to
access endpoints of a Kubelet to establish connections to Pods,
retrieve container logs, and more. While Kubernetes already validates
the proxying address for Nodes, a bug in kube-apiserver made it
possible to bypass this validation. Bypassing this validation could
allow authenticated requests destined for Nodes to to the API server's
private network.

interface. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send an HTTP
packet to the data retrieval interface (/cgi/get_param.cgi) with the
tmpToken cookie set to an empty string followed by a semicolon. This
bypasses an active session authorization check. This can be then used
to fetch the values of protected sys.passwd and sys.su.name fields

The Jetpack CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHAR
deserialization via the &#8216;zbscrmcsvimpf&#8217; parameter in the
'zeroBSCRM_CSVImporterLitehtml_app' function in versions up to, and
including, 5.3.1. While the function performs a nonce check, steps 2
and 3 of the check do not take any action upon a failed check. These
steps then perform a 'file_exists' check on the value of
'zbscrmcsvimpf'. If a phar:// archive is supplied, its contents will
be deserialized and an object injected in the execution stream. This
allows an unauthenticated attacker to obtain object injection if they

OpenSSL supports creating a custom cipher via the legacy
EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function and associated function calls. This
function was deprecated in OpenSSL 3.0 and application authors are
instead encouraged to use the new provider mechanism in order to
implement custom ciphers. OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 to 3.0.5 incorrectly
handle legacy custom ciphers passed to the EVP_EncryptInit_ex2(),
EVP_DecryptInit_ex2() and EVP_CipherInit_ex2() functions (as well as
other similarly named encryption and decryption initialisation
functions). Instead of using the custom cipher directly it incorrectly
tries to fetch an equivalent cipher from the available providers. An
equivalent cipher is found based on the NID passed to
EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). This NID is supposed to represent the unique
NID for a given cipher. However it is possible for an application to
incorrectly pass NID_undef as this value in the call to
EVP_CIPHER_meth_new(). When NID_undef is used in this way the OpenSSL
encryption/decryption initialisation function will match the NULL
cipher as being equivalent and will fetch this from the available
providers. This will succeed if the default provider has been loaded
(or if a third party provider has been loaded that offers this
cipher). Using the NULL cipher means that the plaintext is emitted as
the ciphertext. Applications are only affected by this issue if they
call EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() using NID_undef and subsequently use it in
a call to an encryption/decryption initialisation function.
Applications that only use SSL/TLS are not impacted by this issue.
Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.6 (Affected 3.0.0-3.0.5).

The Ultimate Member plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to directory
traversal in versions up to, and including 2.5.0 due to insufficient
input validation on the 'template' attribute used in shortcodes. This
makes it possible for attackers with administrative privileges to
supply arbitrary paths using traversal (../../) to access and include
files outside of the intended directory. If an attacker can
successfully upload a php file then remote code execution via
inclusion may also be possible. Note: for users with less than
administrative capabilities, /wp-admin access needs to be enabled for
that user in order for this to be exploitable by those users.

Delayed TLS hostname verification in the Pulsar Java Client and the
Pulsar Proxy make each client vulnerable to a man in the middle
attack. Connections from the Pulsar Java Client to the Pulsar
Broker/Proxy and connections from the Pulsar Proxy to the Pulsar
Broker are vulnerable. Authentication data is sent before verifying
the server&#8217;s TLS certificate matches the hostname, which means
authentication data could be exposed to an attacker. An attacker can
only take advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a
machine 'between' the client and the server. The attacker must then
actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack by providing the
client with a cryptographically valid certificate for an unrelated
host. Because the client sends authentication data before performing
hostname verification, an attacker could gain access to the client&#8217;s
authentication data. The client eventually closes the connection when
it verifies the hostname and identifies the targeted hostname does not
match a hostname on the certificate. Because the client eventually
closes the connection, the value of the intercepted authentication
data depends on the authentication method used by the client. Token
based authentication and username/password authentication methods are
vulnerable because the authentication data can be used to impersonate
the client in a separate session. This issue affects Apache Pulsar
Java Client versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2;
2.10.0; 2.6.4 and earlier.

TLS hostname verification cannot be enabled in the Pulsar Broker's
Java Client, the Pulsar Broker's Java Admin Client, the Pulsar
WebSocket Proxy's Java Client, and the Pulsar Proxy's Admin Client
leaving intra-cluster connections and geo-replication connections
vulnerable to man in the middle attacks, which could leak credentials,
configuration data, message data, and any other data sent by these
clients. The vulnerability is for both the pulsar+ssl protocol and
HTTPS. An attacker can only take advantage of this vulnerability by
taking control of a machine 'between' the client and the server. The
attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to perform the attack
by providing the client with a cryptographically valid certificate for
an unrelated host. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Broker, Proxy, and
WebSocket Proxy versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to
2.9.2; 2.10.0; 2.6.4 and earlier.

Apache Pulsar Brokers and Proxies create an internal Pulsar Admin
Client that does not verify peer TLS certificates, even when
tlsAllowInsecureConnection is disabled via configuration. The Pulsar
Admin Client's intra-cluster and geo-replication HTTPS connections are
vulnerable to man in the middle attacks, which could leak
authentication data, configuration data, and any other data sent by
these clients. An attacker can only take advantage of this
vulnerability by taking control of a machine 'between' the client and
the server. The attacker must then actively manipulate traffic to
perform the attack. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Broker and Proxy
versions 2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0; 2.6.4

The Apache Pulsar C++ Client does not verify peer TLS certificates
when making HTTPS calls for the OAuth2.0 Client Credential Flow, even
when tlsAllowInsecureConnection is disabled via configuration. This
vulnerability allows an attacker to perform a man in the middle attack
and intercept and/or modify the GET request that is sent to the
ClientCredentialFlow 'issuer url'. The intercepted credentials can be
used to acquire authentication data from the OAuth2.0 server to then
authenticate with an Apache Pulsar cluster. An attacker can only take
advantage of this vulnerability by taking control of a machine
'between' the client and the server. The attacker must then actively
manipulate traffic to perform the attack. The Apache Pulsar Python
Client wraps the C++ client, so it is also vulnerable in the same way.
This issue affects Apache Pulsar C++ Client and Python Client versions
2.7.0 to 2.7.4; 2.8.0 to 2.8.3; 2.9.0 to 2.9.2; 2.10.0 to 2.10.1;
2.6.4 and earlier. Any users running affected versions of the C++
Client or the Python Client should rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0
credentials, including client_id and client_secret. 2.7 C++ and Python
Client users should upgrade to 2.7.5 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0
credentials. 2.8 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.8.4
and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials. 2.9 C++ and Python Client
users should upgrade to 2.9.3 and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0
credentials. 2.10 C++ and Python Client users should upgrade to 2.10.2
and rotate vulnerable OAuth2.0 credentials. 3.0 C++ users are
unaffected and 3.0 Python Client users will be unaffected when it is
released. Any users running the C++ and Python Client for 2.6 or less
should upgrade to one of the above patched versions.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/05/4

Arm guests can cause Dom0 DoS via PV devices When mapping pages of
guests on Arm, dom0 is using an rbtree to keep track of the foreign
mappings. Updating of that rbtree is not always done completely with
the related lock held, resulting in a small race window, which can be
used by unprivileged guests via PV devices to cause inconsistencies of
the rbtree. These inconsistencies can lead to Denial of Service (DoS)
of dom0, e.g. by causing crashes or the inability to perform further
mappings of other guests' memory pages.

Arm: unbounded memory consumption for 2nd-level page tables Certain
actions require e.g. removing pages from a guest's P2M (Physical-to-
Machine) mapping. When large pages are in use to map guest pages in
the 2nd-stage page tables, such a removal operation may incur a memory
allocation (to replace a large mapping with individual smaller ones).
These memory allocations are taken from the global memory pool. A
malicious guest might be able to cause the global memory pool to be
exhausted by manipulating its own P2M mappings.

lock order inversion in transitive grant copy handling As part of

While doing so, locking requirements were not paid attention to. As a
result two cooperating guests granting each other transitive grants
can cause locks to be acquired nested within one another, but in
respectively opposite order. With suitable timing between the involved
grant copy operations this may result in the locking up of a CPU.
