runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers according to
the OCI specification. In affected versions it was found that rootless
runc makes `/sys/fs/cgroup` writable in following conditons: 1. when
runc is executed inside the user namespace, and the `config.json` does
not specify the cgroup namespace to be unshared (e.g..,
`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=host`, with Rootless
Docker/Podman/nerdctl) or 2. when runc is executed outside the user
namespace, and `/sys` is mounted with `rbind, ro` (e.g., `runc spec
--rootless`; this condition is very rare). A container may gain the
write access to user-owned cgroup hierarchy
`/sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/...` on the host . Other users's cgroup
hierarchies are not affected. Users are advised to upgrade to version
1.1.5. Users unable to upgrade may unshare the cgroup namespace
(`(docker|podman|nerdctl) run --cgroupns=private)`. This is the
default behavior of Docker/Podman/nerdctl on cgroup v2 hosts. or add
`/sys/fs/cgroup` to `maskedPaths`.

In Git for Windows, the Windows port of Git, no localized messages are
shipped with the installer. As a consequence, Git is expected not to
localize messages at all, and skips the gettext initialization.
However, due to a change in MINGW-packages, the `gettext()` function's
implicit initialization no longer uses the runtime prefix but uses the
hard-coded path `C:\mingw64\share\locale` to look for localized
messages. And since any authenticated user has the permission to
create folders in `C:\` (and since `C:\mingw64` does not typically
exist), it is possible for low-privilege users to place fake messages
in that location where `git.exe` will pick them up in version 2.40.1.
This vulnerability is relatively hard to exploit and requires social
engineering. For example, a legitimate message at the end of a clone
could be maliciously modified to ask the user to direct their web
browser to a malicious website, and the user might think that the
message comes from Git and is legitimate. It does require local write
access by the attacker, though, which makes this attack vector less
likely. Version 2.40.1 contains a patch for this issue. Some
workarounds are available. Do not work on a Windows machine with
shared accounts, or alternatively create a `C:\mingw64` folder and
leave it empty. Users who have administrative rights may remove the
permission to create folders in `C:\`.

ReportPortal is an AI-powered test automation platform. Prior to
version 5.10.0 of the `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module,
corresponding to ReportPortal version 23.2, the ReportPortal database
becomes unstable and reporting almost fully stops except for small
launches with approximately 1 test inside when the test_item.path
field is exceeded the allowable `ltree` field type indexing limit
(path length>=120, approximately recursive nesting of the nested
steps). REINDEX INDEX path_gist_idx and path_idx aren't helped. The
problem was fixed in `com.epam.reportportal:service-api` module
version 5.10.0 (product release 23.2), where the maximum number of
nested elements were programmatically limited. A workaround is
available. After deletion of the data with long paths, and reindexing
both indexes (path_gist_idx and path_idx), the database becomes stable
and ReportPortal works properly.

Gradio is an open-source Python library to build machine learning and
data science demos and web applications. Versions prior to 3.13.1
contain Use of Hard-coded Credentials. When using Gradio's share links
(i.e. creating a Gradio app and then setting `share=True`), a private
SSH key is sent to any user that connects to the Gradio machine, which
means that a user could access other users' shared Gradio demos. From
there, other exploits are possible depending on the level of
access/exposure the Gradio app provides. This issue is patched in
version 3.13.1, however, users are recommended to update to 3.19.1 or
later where the FRP solution has been properly tested.

Mod_gnutls is a TLS module for Apache HTTPD based on GnuTLS. Versions
from 0.9.0 to 0.12.0 (including) did not properly fail blocking read
operations on TLS connections when the transport hit timeouts. Instead
it entered an endless loop retrying the read operation, consuming CPU
resources. This could be exploited for denial of service attacks. If
trace level logging was enabled, it would also produce an excessive
amount of log output during the loop, consuming disk space. The
problem has been fixed in commit
d7eec4e598158ab6a98bf505354e84352f9715ec, please update to version
0.12.1. There are no workarounds, users who cannot update should apply
the errno fix detailed in the security advisory.

Due to insufficient validation of parameters passed to the legacy HTTP
query API, it is possible to inject crafted OS commands into multiple
parameters and execute malicious code on the OpenTSDB host system.
This exploit exists due to an incomplete fix that was made when this
vulnerability was previously disclosed as CVE-2020-35476. Regex
validation that was implemented to restrict allowed input to the query
API does not work as intended, allowing crafted commands to bypass
validation.

Pluck CMS is vulnerable to an authenticated remote code execution
(RCE) vulnerability through its &#8220;albums&#8221; module. Albums are used to
create collections of images that can be inserted into web pages
across the site. Albums allow the upload of various filetypes, which
undergo a normalization process before being available on the site.
Due to lack of file extension validation, it is possible to upload a
crafted JPEG payload containing an embedded PHP web-shell. An attacker
may navigate to it directly to achieve RCE on the underlying web
server. Administrator credentials for the Pluck CMS web interface are
required to access the albums module feature, and are thus required to
exploit this vulnerability.

The Active Directory Integration plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
Cross-Site Request Forgery leading to time-based SQL Injection via the
orderby and order parameters in versions up to, and including, 4.1.4
due to missing nonce verification on the get_users function and
insufficient escaping on the user supplied parameter and lack of
sufficient preparation on the existing SQL query. This makes it
possible for unauthenticated attackers to append additional SQL
queries into already existing queries that can be used to cause
resource exhaustion via a forged request granted they can trick an
administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Relative library resolution in linux container-executor binary in
Apache Hadoop 3.3.1-3.3.4 on Linux allows local user to gain root
privileges. If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote
(authenticated) users, this MAY permit remote users to gain root
privileges. Hadoop 3.3.0 updated the " YARN Secure Containers
https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-
site/SecureContainer.html " to add a feature for executing user-
submitted applications in isolated linux containers. The native binary
HADOOP_HOME/bin/container-executor is used to launch these containers;
it must be owned by root and have the suid bit set in order for the
YARN processes to run the containers as the specific users submitting
the jobs. The patch " YARN-10495
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-10495 . make the rpath of
container-executor configurable" modified the library loading path for
loading .so files from "$ORIGIN/" to ""$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/". This
is the a path through which libcrypto.so is located. Thus it is is
possible for a user with reduced privileges to install a malicious
libcrypto library into a path to which they have write access, invoke
the container-executor command, and have their modified library
executed as root. If the YARN cluster is accepting work from remote
(authenticated) users, and these users' submitted job are executed in
the physical host, rather than a container, then the CVE permits
remote users to gain root privileges. The fix for the vulnerability is
to revert the change, which is done in YARN-11441
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-11441 , "Revert
YARN-10495". This patch is in hadoop-3.3.5. To determine whether a
version of container-executor is vulnerable, use the readelf command.
If the RUNPATH or RPATH value contains the relative path
"./lib/native/" then it is at risk $ readelf -d container-
executor|grep 'RUNPATH\|RPATH' 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH) Library
runpath: [$ORIGIN/:../lib/native/] If it does not, then it is safe: $
readelf -d container-executor|grep 'RUNPATH\|RPATH' 0x000000000000001d
(RUNPATH) Library runpath: [$ORIGIN/] For an at-risk version of
container-executor to enable privilege escalation, the owner must be
root and the suid bit must be set $ ls -laF /opt/hadoop/bin/container-
executor ---Sr-s---. 1 root hadoop 802968 May 9 20:21
/opt/hadoop/bin/container-executor A safe installation lacks the suid
bit; ideally is also not owned by root. $ ls -laF

Gentoo soko is the code that powers packages.gentoo.org. Versions
prior to 1.0.1 are vulnerable to SQL Injection, leading to a Denial of
Service. If the user selects (in user preferences) the "Recently
Visited Packages" view for the index page, the value of the
`search_history` cookie is used as a base64 encoded comma separated
list of atoms. These are string loaded directly into the SQL query
with `atom = '%s'` format string. As a result, any user can modify the
browser's cookie value and inject most SQL queries. A proof of concept
malformed cookie was generated that wiped the database or changed it's
content. On the database, only public data is stored, so there is no
confidentiality issues to site users. If it is known that the database
was modified, a full restoration of data is possible by performing a
full database wipe and performing full update of all components. This
issue is patched with commit id 5ae9ca83b73. Version 1.0.1 contains
the patch. If users are unable to upgrade immediately, the following
workarounds may be applied: (1.) Use a proxy to always drop the
`search_history` cookie until upgraded. The impact on user experience
is low. (2.) Sanitize to the value of `search_history` cookie after
base64 decoding it.

react/http is an event-driven, streaming HTTP client and server
implementation for ReactPHP. Previous versions of ReactPHP's HTTP
server component contain a potential DoS vulnerability that can cause
high CPU load when processing large HTTP request bodies. This
vulnerability has little to no impact on the default configuration,
but can be exploited when explicitly using the
RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with very large settings. This might lead
to consuming large amounts of CPU time for processing requests and
significantly delay or slow down the processing of legitimate user
requests. This issue has been addressed in release 1.9.0. Users are
advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may keep the request body
limited using RequestBodyBufferMiddleware with a sensible value which
should mitigate the issue. An infrastructure or DevOps workaround
could be to place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP server
to filter out any excessive HTTP request bodies.

NodeBB is Node.js based forum software. Starting in version 2.5.0 and
prior to version 2.8.7, due to the use of the object destructuring
assignment syntax in the user export code path, combined with a path
traversal vulnerability, a specially crafted payload could invoke the
user export logic to arbitrarily execute javascript files on the local
disk. This issue is patched in version 2.8.7. As a workaround, site
maintainers can cherry pick the fix into their codebase to patch the
exploit.

teler-waf is a Go HTTP middleware that provides teler IDS
functionality to protect against web-based attacks. In teler-waf prior
to version 0.1.1 is vulnerable to bypassing common web attack rules
when a specific HTML entities payload is used. This vulnerability
allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the
victim's browser and compromise the security of the web application.
The vulnerability exists due to teler-waf failure to properly sanitize
and filter HTML entities in user input. An attacker can exploit this
vulnerability to bypass common web attack threat rules in teler-waf
and launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The attacker can
execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the victim's browser and steal
sensitive information, such as login credentials and session tokens,
or take control of the victim's browser and perform malicious actions.
This issue has been fixed in version 0.1.1.

Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. In affected
versions servlets with multipart support (e.g. annotated with
`@MultipartConfig`) that call `HttpServletRequest.getParameter()` or
`HttpServletRequest.getParts()` may cause `OutOfMemoryError` when the
client sends a multipart request with a part that has a name but no
filename and very large content. This happens even with the default
settings of `fileSizeThreshold=0` which should stream the whole part
content to disk. An attacker client may send a large multipart request
and cause the server to throw `OutOfMemoryError`. However, the server
may be able to recover after the `OutOfMemoryError` and continue its
service -- although it may take some time. This issue has been patched
in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, and 11.0.14. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may set the multipart parameter
`maxRequestSize` which must be set to a non-negative value, so the
whole multipart content is limited (although still read into memory).

Jetty is a java based web server and servlet engine. Nonstandard
cookie parsing in Jetty may allow an attacker to smuggle cookies
within other cookies, or otherwise perform unintended behavior by
tampering with the cookie parsing mechanism. If Jetty sees a cookie
VALUE that starts with `"` (double quote), it will continue to read
the cookie string until it sees a closing quote -- even if a semicolon
is encountered. So, a cookie header such as: `DISPLAY_LANGUAGE="b;
JSESSIONID=1337; c=d"` will be parsed as one cookie, with the name
DISPLAY_LANGUAGE and a value of b; JSESSIONID=1337; c=d instead of 3
separate cookies. This has security implications because if, say,
JSESSIONID is an HttpOnly cookie, and the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie
value is rendered on the page, an attacker can smuggle the JSESSIONID
cookie into the DISPLAY_LANGUAGE cookie and thereby exfiltrate it.
This is significant when an intermediary is enacting some policy based
on cookies, so a smuggled cookie can bypass that policy yet still be
seen by the Jetty server or its logging system. This issue has been
addressed in versions 9.4.51, 10.0.14, 11.0.14, and 12.0.0.beta0 and
users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
issue.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support
for multi-language development. This is a collision attack on long IDs
(64bits) for PGP keys. Users of dependency verification in Gradle are
vulnerable if they use long IDs for PGP keys in a `trusted-key` or
`pgp` element in their dependency verification metadata file. The fix
is to fail dependency verification if anything but a fingerprint is
used in a trust element in dependency verification metadata. The
problem is fixed in Gradle 8.0 and above. The problem is also patched
in Gradle 6.9.4 and 7.6.1. As a workaround, use only full fingerprint
IDs for `trusted-key` or `pgp` element in the metadata is a protection
against this issue.

BuildKit is a toolkit for converting source code to build artifacts in
an efficient, expressive and repeatable manner. In affected versions
when the user sends a build request that contains a Git URL that
contains credentials and the build creates a provenance attestation
describing that build, these credentials could be visible from the
provenance attestation. Git URL can be passed in two ways: 1) Invoking
build directly from a URL with credentials. 2) If the client sends
additional version control system (VCS) info hint parameters on builds
from a local source. Usually, that would mean reading the origin URL
from `.git/config` file. When a build is performed under specific
conditions where credentials were passed to BuildKit they may be
visible to everyone who has access to provenance attestation.
Provenance attestations and VCS info hints were added in version
v0.11.0. Previous versions are not vulnerable. In v0.10, when building
directly from Git URL, the same URL could be visible in `BuildInfo`
structure that is a predecessor of Provenance attestations. Previous
versions are not vulnerable. This bug has been fixed in v0.11.4. Users
are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may disable VCS info
hints by setting `BUILDX_GIT_INFO=0`. `buildctl` does not set VCS
hints based on `.git` directory, and values would need to be passed
manually with `--opt`.

Versions of the package blamer before 1.0.4 are vulnerable to
Arbitrary Argument Injection via the blameByFile() API. The library
does not sanitize for user input or validate the given file path
conforms to a specific schema, nor does it properly pass command-line
flags to the git binary using the double-dash POSIX characters (--) to

Reference: URL:https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-PYDASH-5916518

This affects versions of the package pydash before 6.0.0. A number of
pydash methods such as pydash.objects.invoke() and
pydash.collections.invoke_map() accept dotted paths (Deep Path
Strings) to target a nested Python object, relative to the original
source object. These paths can be used to target internal class
attributes and dict items, to retrieve, modify or invoke nested Python
objects. **Note:** The pydash.objects.invoke() method is vulnerable to
Command Injection when the following prerequisites are satisfied: 1)
The source object (argument 1) is not a built-in object such as
list/dict (otherwise, the __init__.__globals__ path is not accessible)
2) The attacker has control over argument 2 (the path string) and
argument 3 (the argument to pass to the invoked method) The
pydash.collections.invoke_map() method is also vulnerable, but is
harder to exploit as the attacker does not have direct control over
the argument to be passed to the invoked function.

malicious ones. This can be problematic if the software depends on
existence or non-existence of certain attributes, or uses pre-defined
attributes of object prototype (such as hasOwnProperty, toString or
valueOf). User controlled inputs inside the extend() method of the
Mock.Handler, Mock.Random, Mock.RE.Handler or Mock.Util, will allow an
attacker to exploit this vulnerability. Workaround By using a denylist
of dangerous attributes, this weakness can be eliminated. Add the
following line in the Util.extend function: js js if (["__proto__",
"constructor", "prototype"].includes(name)) continue js //
src/mock/handler.js Util.extend = function extend() { var target =
arguments[0] || {}, i = 1, length = arguments.length, options, name,
src, copy, clone if (length === 1) { target = this i = 0 } for (; i <
length; i++) { options = arguments[i] if (!options) continue for (name
in options) { if (["__proto__", "constructor",
"prototype"].includes(name)) continue src = target[name] copy =
options[name] if (target === copy) continue if (copy === undefined)
continue if (Util.isArray(copy) || Util.isObject(copy)) { if
(Util.isArray(copy)) clone = src && Util.isArray(src) ? src : [] if
(Util.isObject(copy)) clone = src && Util.isObject(src) ? src : {}
target[name] = Util.extend(clone, copy) } else { target[name] = copy }
} } return target }

Versions of the package follow-redirects before 1.15.4 are vulnerable
to Improper Input Validation due to the improper handling of URLs by
the url.parse() function. When new URL() throws an error, it can be
manipulated to misinterpret the hostname. An attacker could exploit
this weakness to redirect traffic to a malicious site, potentially
leading to information disclosure, phishing attacks, or other security
breaches.

There exists an authentication bypass vulnerability in OpenThread
border router devices and implementations. This issue allows
unauthenticated nodes to craft radio frames using &#8220;Key ID Mode 2&#8221;: a
special mode using a static encryption key to bypass security checks,
resulting in arbitrary IP packets being allowed on the Thread network.
This provides a pathway for an attacker to send/receive arbitrary IPv6
packets to devices on the LAN, potentially exploiting them if they
lack additional authentication or contain any network vulnerabilities
that would normally be mitigated by the home router&#8217;s NAT firewall.
Effected devices have been mitigated through an automatic update

Design documents with matching document IDs, from databases on the
same cluster, may share a mutable Javascript environment when using
these design document functions: * validate_doc_update * list * filter
* filter views (using view functions as filters) * rewrite * update
This doesn't affect map/reduce or search (Dreyfus) index functions.
Users are recommended to upgrade to a version that is no longer
affected by this issue (Apache CouchDB 3.3.2 or 3.2.3). Workaround:
Avoid using design documents from untrusted sources which may attempt
to cache or store data in the Javascript environment.

The underlying feedback mechanism of Rockwell Automation's FactoryTalk
System Services that transfers the FactoryTalk Policy Manager rules to
relevant devices on the network does not verify that the origin of the
communication is from a legitimate local client device. This may allow
a threat actor to craft a malicious website that, when visited, will
send a malicious script that can connect to the local WebSocket
endpoint and wait for events as if it was a valid client device. If
successfully exploited, this would allow a threat actor to receive
information including whether FactoryTalk Policy Manager is installed

Attackers with access to the "documentconverterws" API were able to
inject serialized Java objects, that were not properly checked during
deserialization. Access to this API endpoint is restricted to local
networks by default. Arbitrary code could be injected that is being

restrict processing of legal and expected classes for this API. We now
log a warning in case there are attempts to inject illegal classes. No

External service lookups for a number of protocols were vulnerable to
a time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) weakness, involving the JDK DNS
cache. Attackers that were timing DNS cache expiry correctly were able
to inject configuration that would bypass existing network deny-lists.
Attackers could exploit this weakness to discover the existence of
restricted network infrastructure and service availability.

The "OX Count" web service did not specify a media-type when
processing responses by external resources. Malicious script code can
be executed within the victims context. This can lead to session
hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface and
API. To exploit this an attacker would require temporary access to the
users account or lure a user to a compromised account. We are now
defining the accepted media-type to avoid code execution. No publicly
available exploits are known.

Functions with insufficient randomness were used to generate
authorization tokens of the integrated oAuth Authorization Service.
Authorization codes were predictable for third parties and could be
used to intercept and take over the client authorization process. As a
result, other users accounts could be compromised. The oAuth
Authorization Service is not enabled by default. We have updated the
implementation to use sources with sufficient randomness to generate
authorization tokens. No publicly available exploits are known.

strongSwan 5.9.8 and 5.9.9 potentially allows remote code execution
because it uses a variable named "public" for two different purposes
within the same function. There is initially incorrect access control,
later followed by an expired pointer dereference. One attack vector is
sending an untrusted client certificate during EAP-TLS. A server is
affected only if it loads plugins that implement TLS-based EAP methods
(EAP-TLS, EAP-TTLS, EAP-PEAP, or EAP-TNC). This is fixed in 5.9.10.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. It's possible to make the farm
unusable by adding an object to a page with a huge number (e.g.
67108863). Most of the time this will fill the memory allocated to
XWiki and make it unusable every time this document is manipulated.
This issue has been patched in XWiki 14.0-rc-1.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version
11.6-rc-1, comments are supposed to be executed with the right of
superadmin but in restricted mode (anything dangerous is disabled),
but the async macro does not take into account the restricted mode.
This means that any user with comment right can use the async macro to
make it execute any wiki content with the right of superadmin. This
has been patched in XWiki 14.9, 14.4.6, and 13.10.10. The only known

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version
2.3-milestone-1, the annotation displayer does not execute the content
in a restricted context. This allows executing anything with the right
of the author of any document by annotating the document. This has
been patched in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10. There is no easy
workaround except to upgrade.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 3.2-m3,
users can deduce the content of the password fields by repeated call
to `LiveTableResults` and `WikisLiveTableResultsMacros`. The issue can
be fixed by upgrading to versions 14.7-rc-1, 13.4.4, or 13.10.9 and
higher, or in version >= 3.2M3 by applying the patch manually on
`LiveTableResults` and `WikisLiveTableResultsMacros`.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in versions
6.3-rc-1 and 6.2.4, it's possible to inject arbitrary wiki syntax
including Groovy, Python and Velocity script macros via the
`newThemeName` request parameter (URL parameter), in combination with
additional parameters. This has been patched in the supported versions
13.10.10, 14.9-rc-1, and 14.4.6. As a workaround, it is possible to
edit `FlamingoThemesCode.WebHomeSheet` and manually perform the
changes from the patch fixing the issue.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version 6.0,
users with write rights can insert well-formed content that is not
handled well by the parser. As a consequence, some pages becomes
unusable, including the user index (if the page containing the faulty
content is a user page) and the page index. Note that on the page, the
normal UI is completely missing and it is not possible to open the
editor directly to revert the change as the stack overflow is already
triggered while getting the title of the document. This means that it
is quite difficult to remove this content once inserted. This has been
patched in XWiki 13.10.10, 14.4.6, and 14.9-rc-1. A temporary
workaround to avoid Stack Overflow errors is to increase the memory
allocated to the stack by using the `-Xss` JVM parameter (e.g.,
`-Xss32m`). This should allow the parser to pass and to fix the faulty
content. The consequences for other aspects of the system (e.g.,
performance) are unknown, and this workaround should be only be used
as a temporary solution. The workaround does not prevent the issue
occurring again with other content. Consequently, it is strongly
advised to upgrade to a version where the issue has been patched.

authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Due to an insufficient
access check, a recovery flow link that is created by an admin (or
sent via email by an admin) can be used to set the password for any
arbitrary user. This attack is only possible if a recovery flow
exists, which has both an Identification and an Email stage bound to
it. If the flow has policies on the identification stage to skip it
when the flow is restored (by checking
`request.context['is_restored']`), the flow is not affected by this.
With this flow in place, an administrator must create a recovery Link
or send a recovery URL to the attacker, who can, due to the improper
validation of the token create, set the password for any account.
Regardless, for custom recovery flows it is recommended to add a
policy that checks if the flow is restored, and skips the
identification stage. This issue has been fixed in versions 2023.2.3,
2023.1.3 and 2022.12.2.

Nextcloud server is an open source home cloud implementation. In
affected versions a missing scope validation allowed users to create
workflows which are designed to be only available for administrators.
Some workflows are designed to be RCE by invoking defined scripts, in
order to generate PDFs, invoking webhooks or running scripts on the
server. Due to this combination depending on the available apps the
issue can result in a RCE at the end. It is recommended that the
Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 24.0.10 or 25.0.4. Users unable to
upgrade should disable app `workflow_scripts` and
`workflow_pdf_converter` as a mitigation.

gosaml2 is a Pure Go implementation of SAML 2.0. SAML Service
Providers using this library for SAML authentication support are
likely susceptible to Denial of Service attacks. A bug in this library
enables attackers to craft a `deflate`-compressed request which will
consume significantly more memory during processing than the size of
the original request. This may eventually lead to memory exhaustion
and the process being killed. The maximum compression ratio achievable
with `deflate` is 1032:1, so by limiting the size of bodies passed to
gosaml2, limiting the rate and concurrency of calls, and ensuring that
lots of memory is available to the process it _may_ be possible to
help Go's garbage collector "keep up". Implementors are encouraged not
to rely on this. This issue is fixed in version 0.9.0.

KubeVirt is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes. In
versions 0.59.0 and prior, if a malicious user has taken over a
Kubernetes node where virt-handler (the KubeVirt node-daemon) is
running, the virt-handler service account can be used to modify all
node specs. This can be misused to lure-in system-level-privileged
components which can, for instance, read all secrets on the cluster,
or can exec into pods on other nodes. This way, a compromised node can
be used to elevate privileges beyond the node until potentially having
full privileged access to the whole cluster. The simplest way to
exploit this, once a user could compromise a specific node, is to set
with the virt-handler service account all other nodes to unschedulable
and simply wait until system-critical components with high privileges
appear on its node. No patches are available as of time of
publication. As a workaround, gatekeeper users can add a webhook which
will block the `virt-handler` service account to modify the spec of a
node.

cmark-gfm is GitHub's fork of cmark, a CommonMark parsing and
rendering library and program in C. A polynomial time complexity issue
in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource exhaustion and subsequent
denial of service. This CVE covers quadratic complexity issues when
parsing text which leads with either large numbers of `_` characters.
This issue has been addressed in version 0.29.0.gfm.10. Users are
advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should validate that their
input comes from trusted sources. ### Impact A polynomial time
complexity issue in cmark-gfm may lead to unbounded resource
exhaustion and subsequent denial of service. ### Proof of concept ```
$ ~/cmark-gfm$ python3 -c 'pad = "_" * 100000; print(pad + "." + pad,
end="")' | time ./build/src/cmark-gfm --to plaintext ``` Increasing
the number 10000 in the above commands causes the running time to
increase quadratically. ### Patches This vulnerability have been
patched in 0.29.0.gfm.10. ### Note on cmark and cmark-gfm XXX: TBD
[cmark-gfm](https://github.com/github/cmark-gfm) is a fork of
[cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) that adds the GitHub
Flavored Markdown extensions. The two codebases have diverged over
time, but share a common core. These bugs affect both `cmark` and
`cmark-gfm`. ### Credit We would like to thank @gravypod for reporting

Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating,
saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs. The Vega
`scale` expression function has the ability to call arbitrary
functions with a single controlled argument. The scale expression
function passes a user supplied argument group to getScale, which is
then used as if it were an internal context. The
context.scales[name].value is accessed from group and called as a
function back in scale. This can be exploited to escape the Vega
expression sandbox in order to execute arbitrary JavaScript. This
issue has been fixed in version 5.13.1.

Vega is a visualization grammar, a declarative format for creating,
saving, and sharing interactive visualization designs.`lassoAppend'
function accepts 3 arguments and internally invokes `push` function on
the 1st argument specifying array consisting of 2nd and 3rd arguments
as `push` call argument. The type of the 1st argument is supposed to
be an array, but it's not enforced. This makes it possible to specify
any object with a `push` function as the 1st argument, `push` function
can be set to any function that can be access via `event.view` (no all
such functions can be exploited due to invalid context or signature,
but some can, e.g. `console.log`). The issue is that`lassoAppend`
doesn't enforce proper types of its arguments. This issue opens
various XSS vectors, but exact impact and severity depends on the
environment (e.g. Core JS `setImmediate` polyfill basically allows
`eval`-like functionality). This issue was patched in 5.23.0.

wasmtime is a fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly. In affected
versions wasmtime's code generator, Cranelift, has a bug on x86_64
targets where address-mode computation mistakenly would calculate a
35-bit effective address instead of WebAssembly's defined 33-bit
effective address. This bug means that, with default codegen settings,
a wasm-controlled load/store operation could read/write addresses up
to 35 bits away from the base of linear memory. Due to this bug,
however, addresses up to `0xffffffff * 8 + 0x7ffffffc = 36507222004 =
~34G` bytes away from the base of linear memory are possible from
guest code. This means that the virtual memory 6G away from the base
of linear memory up to ~34G away can be read/written by a malicious
module. A guest module can, without the knowledge of the embedder,
read/write memory in this region. The memory may belong to other
WebAssembly instances when using the pooling allocator, for example.
Affected embedders are recommended to analyze preexisting wasm modules
to see if they're affected by the incorrect codegen rules and possibly
correlate that with an anomalous number of traps during historical
execution to locate possibly suspicious modules. The specific bug in
Cranelift's x86_64 backend is that a WebAssembly address which is
left-shifted by a constant amount from 1 to 3 will get folded into
x86_64's addressing modes which perform shifts. For example `(i32.load
(i32.shl (local.get 0) (i32.const 3)))` loads from the WebAssembly
address `$local0 << 3`. When translated to Cranelift the `$local0 <<
3` computation, a 32-bit value, is zero-extended to a 64-bit value and
then added to the base address of linear memory. Cranelift would
generate an instruction of the form `movl (%base, %local0, 8), %dst`
which calculates `%base + %local0 << 3`. The bug here, however, is
that the address computation happens with 64-bit values, where the
`$local0 << 3` computation was supposed to be truncated to a a 32-bit
value. This means that `%local0`, which can use up to 32-bits for an
address, gets 3 extra bits of address space to be accessible via this
`movl` instruction. The fix in Cranelift is to remove the erroneous
lowering rules in the backend which handle these zero-extended
expression. The above example is then translated to `movl %local0,
%temp; shl $3, %temp; movl (%base, %temp), %dst` which correctly
truncates the intermediate computation of `%local0 << 3` to 32-bits
inside the `%temp` register which is then added to the `%base` value.
Wasmtime version 4.0.1, 5.0.1, and 6.0.1 have been released and have
all been patched to no longer contain the erroneous lowering rules.
While updating Wasmtime is recommended, there are a number of possible
workarounds that embedders can employ to mitigate this issue if
updating is not possible. Note that none of these workarounds are on-
by-default and require explicit configuration: 1. The
`Config::static_memory_maximum_size(0)` option can be used to force
all accesses to linear memory to be explicitly bounds-checked. This
will perform a bounds check separately from the address-mode
computation which correctly calculates the effective address of a
load/store. Note that this can have a large impact on the execution
performance of WebAssembly modules. 2. The
`Config::static_memory_guard_size(1 << 36)` option can be used to
greatly increase the guard pages placed after linear memory. This will
guarantee that memory accesses up-to-34G away are guaranteed to be
semantically correct by reserving unmapped memory for the instance.
Note that this reserves a very large amount of virtual memory per-
instances and can greatly reduce the maximum number of concurrent
instances being run. 3. If using a non-x86_64 host is possible, then
that will also work around this bug. This bug does not affect
Wasmtime's or Cranelift's AArch64 backend, for example.

mailcow is a dockerized email package, with multiple containers linked
in one bridged network. The Sync Job feature - which can be made
available to standard users by assigning them the necessary permission
- suffers from a shell command injection. A malicious user can abuse
this vulnerability to obtain shell access to the Docker container
running dovecot. The imapsync Perl script implements all the necessary
functionality for this feature, including the XOAUTH2 authentication
mechanism. This code path creates a shell command to call openssl.
However, since different parts of the specified user password are
included without any validation, one can simply execute additional
shell commands. Notably, the default ACL for a newly-created mailcow
account does not include the necessary permission. The Issue has been
fixed within the 2023-03 Update (March 3rd 2023). As a temporary
workaround the Syncjob ACL can be removed from all mailbox users,
preventing from creating or changing existing Syncjobs.

Cocos Engine is an open-source framework for building 2D & 3D real-
time rendering and interactive content. In the github repo for Cocos
Engine the `web-interface-check.yml` was subject to command injection.
The `web-interface-check.yml` was triggered when a pull request was
opened or updated and contained the user controllable field `(${{
github.head_ref }} &#8211; the name of the fork&#8217;s branch)`. This would allow
an attacker to take over the GitHub Runner and run custom commands
(potentially stealing secrets such as GITHUB_TOKEN) and altering the
repository. The workflow has since been removed for the repository.
There are no actions required of users.

Issue summary: Processing some specially crafted ASN.1 object
identifiers or data containing them may be very slow. Impact summary:
Applications that use OBJ_obj2txt() directly, or use any of the
OpenSSL subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS, CMP/CRMF or TS with no
message size limit may experience notable to very long delays when
processing those messages, which may lead to a Denial of Service. An
OBJECT IDENTIFIER is composed of a series of numbers - sub-identifiers
- most of which have no size limit. OBJ_obj2txt() may be used to
translate an ASN.1 OBJECT IDENTIFIER given in DER encoding form (using
the OpenSSL type ASN1_OBJECT) to its canonical numeric text form,
which are the sub-identifiers of the OBJECT IDENTIFIER in decimal
form, separated by periods. When one of the sub-identifiers in the
OBJECT IDENTIFIER is very large (these are sizes that are seen as
absurdly large, taking up tens or hundreds of KiBs), the translation
to a decimal number in text may take a very long time. The time
complexity is O(n^2) with 'n' being the size of the sub-identifiers in
bytes (*). With OpenSSL 3.0, support to fetch cryptographic algorithms
using names / identifiers in string form was introduced. This includes
using OBJECT IDENTIFIERs in canonical numeric text form as identifiers
for fetching algorithms. Such OBJECT IDENTIFIERs may be received
through the ASN.1 structure AlgorithmIdentifier, which is commonly
used in multiple protocols to specify what cryptographic algorithm
should be used to sign or verify, encrypt or decrypt, or digest passed
data. Applications that call OBJ_obj2txt() directly with untrusted
data are affected, with any version of OpenSSL. If the use is for the
mere purpose of display, the severity is considered low. In OpenSSL
3.0 and newer, this affects the subsystems OCSP, PKCS7/SMIME, CMS,
CMP/CRMF or TS. It also impacts anything that processes X.509
certificates, including simple things like verifying its signature.
The impact on TLS is relatively low, because all versions of OpenSSL
have a 100KiB limit on the peer's certificate chain. Additionally,
this only impacts clients, or servers that have explicitly enabled
client authentication. In OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2, this only affects
displaying diverse objects, such as X.509 certificates. This is
assumed to not happen in such a way that it would cause a Denial of
Service, so these versions are considered not affected by this issue
in such a way that it would be cause for concern, and the severity is
therefore considered low.

io.finnet tss-lib before 2.0.0 can leak the lambda value of a private
key via a timing side-channel attack because it relies on Go big.Int,
which is not constant time for Cmp, modular exponentiation, or modular
inverse. An example leak is in crypto/paillier/paillier.go. (bnb-
chain/tss-lib and thorchain/tss are also affected.)

systemd before 247 does not adequately block local privilege
escalation for some Sudo configurations, e.g., plausible sudoers files
in which the "systemctl status" command may be executed. Specifically,
systemd does not set LESSSECURE to 1, and thus other programs may be
launched from the less program. This presents a substantial security
risk when running systemctl from Sudo, because less executes as root
when the terminal size is too small to show the complete systemctl
output.

The email module of Python through 3.11.3 incorrectly parses e-mail
addresses that contain a special character. The wrong portion of an
RFC2822 header is identified as the value of the addr-spec. In some
applications, an attacker can bypass a protection mechanism in which
application access is granted only after verifying receipt of e-mail
to a specific domain (e.g., only @company.example.com addresses may be
used for signup). This occurs in email/_parseaddr.py in recent
versions of Python.

The OTP Login Woocommerce & Gravity Forms plugin for WordPress is
vulnerable to authentication bypass. This is due to the fact that when
generating OTP codes for users to use in order to login via phone
number, the plugin returns these codes in an AJAX response. This makes
it possible for unauthenticated attackers to obtain login codes for
administrators. This does require an attacker have access to the phone
number configured for an account, which can be obtained via social
engineering or reconnaissance.

The Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
Scripting via the 'gh_form' shortcode in versions up to, and
including, 2.7.9.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a
user accesses an injected page. Please note this only works with
legacy contact forms.

The Groundhogg plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.7.9.8. This is due
to missing nonce validation in the 'ajax_edit_contact' function. This
makes it possible for authenticated attackers to receive the auto
login link via shortcode and then modify the assigned user to the auto
login link to elevate verified user privileges via a forged request
granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
such as clicking on a link.

GNU libmicrohttpd before 0.9.76 allows remote DoS (Denial of Service)
due to improper parsing of a multipart/form-data boundary in the
postprocessor.c MHD_create_post_processor() method. This allows an
attacker to remotely send a malicious HTTP POST packet that includes

The Rockwell Automation Enhanced HIM software contains an API that the
application uses that is not protected sufficiently and uses incorrect
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) settings and, as a result, is
vulnerable to a Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. To exploit
this vulnerability, a malicious user would have to convince a user to
click on an untrusted link through a social engineering attack or
successfully perform a Cross Site Scripting Attack (XSS). Exploitation
of a CSRF could potentially lead to sensitive information disclosure
and full remote access to the affected products.

wasmtime is a fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime's code
generation backend, Cranelift, has a bug on x86_64 platforms for the
WebAssembly `i8x16.select` instruction which will produce the wrong
results when the same operand is provided to the instruction and some
of the selected indices are greater than 16. There is an off-by-one
error in the calculation of the mask to the `pshufb` instruction which
causes incorrect results to be returned if lanes are selected from the
second vector. This codegen bug has been fixed in Wasmtiem 6.0.1,
5.0.1, and 4.0.1. Users are recommended to upgrade to these updated
versions. If upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can
avoid this miscompilation by disabling the Wasm simd proposal.
Additionally the bug is only present on x86_64 hosts. Other platforms
such as AArch64 and s390x are not affected.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. In affected versions any user
with view rights can execute arbitrary Groovy, Python or Velocity code
in XWiki leading to full access to the XWiki installation. The root
cause is improper escaping of UIX parameters. A proof of concept
exploit is to log in, add an `XWiki.UIExtensionClass` xobject to the
user profile page, with an Extension Parameters content containing
`label={{/html}} {{async async="true" cached="false"
context="doc.reference"}}{{groovy}}println("Hello " + "from
groovy!"){{/groovy}}{{/async}}`. Then, navigating to
`PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` (i.e., `<xwiki-
host>/xwiki/bin/view/PanelsCode/ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet`
where `<xwiki-host>` is the URL of your XWiki installation) should not
execute the Groovy script. If it does, you will see `Hello from
groovy!` displayed on the screen. This vulnerability has been patched
in XWiki 13.10.11, 14.4.7 and 14.10-rc-1. Users are advised to
upgrade. For users unable to upgrade the issue can be fixed by editing
the `PanelsCode.ApplicationsPanelConfigurationSheet` wiki page and
making the same modifications as shown in commit `6de5442f3c`.

Directus is a real-time API and App dashboard for managing SQL

to the `password` field in `directus_users` can extract the argon2
password hashes by brute forcing the export functionality combined

password hashes. Accounts cannot be taken over unless the hashes can
be reversed which is unlikely with current hardware. This problem has
been patched by preventing any hashed/concealed field to be filtered
against with the `_starts_with` or other string operator in version
9.16.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may
mitigate this issue by ensuring that no user has `read` access to the

environment, are not affected. The issue has been mitigated and closed
in Supervisor version 2023.03.1, which has been rolled out to all
affected installations via the auto-update feature of the Supervisor.
This rollout has been completed at the time of publication of this
advisory. Home Assistant Core 2023.3.0 included mitigation for this
vulnerability. Upgrading to at least that version is thus advised. In
case one is not able to upgrade the Home Assistant Supervisor or the
Home Assistant Core application at this time, it is advised to not

crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes
controllers in Crossplane and its related stacks. An out of memory
panic vulnerability has been discovered in affected versions.
Applications that use the `Paved` type's `SetValue` method with user
provided input without proper validation might use excessive amounts
of memory and cause an out of memory panic. In the fieldpath package,
the Paved.SetValue method sets a value on the Paved object according
to the provided path, without any validation. This allows setting
values in slices at any provided index, which grows the target array
up to the requested index, the index is currently capped at max uint32
(4294967295) given how indexes are parsed, but that is still an
unnecessarily large value. If callers are not validating paths'
indexes on their own, which most probably are not going to do, given
that the input is parsed directly in the SetValue method, this could
allow users to consume arbitrary amounts of memory. Applications that
do not use the `Paved` type's `SetValue` method are not affected. This
issue has been addressed in versions 0.16.1 and 0.19.2. Users are
advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can parse and validate the
path before passing it to the `SetValue` method of the `Paved` type,
constraining the index size as deemed appropriate.

crossplane-runtime is a set of go libraries used to build Kubernetes
controllers in Crossplane and its related stacks. In affected versions
an already highly privileged user able to create or update
Compositions can specify an arbitrarily high index in a patch's
`ToFieldPath`, which could lead to excessive memory usage once such
Composition is selected for a Composite resource. Compositions allow
users to specify patches inserting elements into arrays at an
arbitrary index. When a Composition is selected for a Composite
Resource, patches are evaluated and if a specified index is greater
than the current size of the target slice, Crossplane will grow that
slice up to the specified index, which could lead to an excessive
amount of memory usage and therefore the Pod being OOM-Killed. The
index is already capped to the maximum value for a uint32 (4294967295)
when parsed, but that is still an unnecessarily large value. This
issue has been addressed in versions 1.11.2, 1.10.3, and 1.9.2. Users
are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can restrict write
privileges on Compositions to only admin users as a workaround.

untrusted client. The faked header would then be used for trace logs
and grpc logs, as well as used in the URL used for `jwt_authn` checks
if the `jwt_authn` filter is used, and any other upstream use of the
x-envoy-original-path header. Attackers may forge a trusted `x-envoy-
original-path` header. Versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and
1.22.9 have patches for this issue.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/security/advisories/GHSA-9g5w-hqr3-w2ph

Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-
native applications. Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6,
and 1.22.9, escalation of privileges is possible when
`failure_mode_allow: true` is configured for `ext_authz` filter. For
affected components that are used for logging and/or visibility,
requests may not be logged by the receiving service. When Envoy was
configured to use ext_authz, ext_proc, tap, ratelimit filters, and
grpc access log service and an http header with non-UTF-8 data was
received, Envoy would generate an invalid protobuf message and send it
to the configured service. The receiving service would typically
generate an error when decoding the protobuf message. For ext_authz
that was configured with ``failure_mode_allow: true``, the request
would have been allowed in this case. For the other services, this
could have resulted in other unforeseen errors such as a lack of
visibility into requests. As of versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4,
1.23.6, and 1.22.9, Envoy by default sanitizes the values sent in gRPC
service calls to be valid UTF-8, replacing data that is not valid
UTF-8 with a `!` character. This behavioral change can be temporarily
reverted by setting runtime guard
`envoy.reloadable_features.service_sanitize_non_utf8_strings` to
false. As a workaround, one may set `failure_mode_allow: false` for
`ext_authz`.

NextAuth.js is an open source authentication solution for Next.js
applications. `next-auth` applications using OAuth provider versions
before `v4.20.1` have been found to be subject to an authentication
vulnerability. A bad actor who can read traffic on the victim's
network or who is able to social engineer the victim to click a
manipulated login link could intercept and tamper with the
authorization URL to **log in as the victim**, bypassing the CSRF
protection. This is due to a partial failure during a compromised
OAuth session where a session code is erroneously generated. This
issue has been addressed in version 4.20.1. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may using Advanced Initialization,
manually check the callback request for state, pkce, and nonce against
the provider configuration to prevent this issue. See the linked GHSA
for details.

@fastify/csrf-protection is a plugin which helps protect Fastify
servers against CSRF attacks. The CSRF protection enforced by the
@fastify/csrf-protection library in combination with @fastify/cookie
can be bypassed from network and same-site attackers under certain
conditions. @fastify/csrf-protection supports an optional userInfo
parameter that binds the CSRF token to the user. This parameter has
been introduced to prevent cookie-tossing attacks as a fix for
CVE-2021-29624. Whenever userInfo parameter is missing, or its value
can be predicted for the target user account, network and same-site
attackers can 1. fixate a _csrf cookie in the victim's browser, and 2.
forge CSRF tokens that are valid for the victim's session. This allows
attackers to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism. As a fix,
@fastify/csrf-protection starting from version 6.3.0 (and v4.1.0)
includes a server-defined secret hmacKey that cryptographically binds
the CSRF token to the value of the _csrf cookie and the userInfo
parameter, making tokens non-spoofable by attackers. This protection
is effective as long as the userInfo parameter is unique for each
user. This is patched in versions 6.3.0 and v4.1.0. Users are advised
to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use a random, non-predictable
userInfo parameter for each user as a mitigation.

Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy designed for cloud-
native applications. Prior to versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6,
and 1.22.9, the OAuth filter assumes that a `state` query param is
present on any response that looks like an OAuth redirect response.
Sending it a request with the URI path equivalent to the redirect
path, without the `state` parameter, will lead to abnormal termination
of Envoy process. Versions 1.26.0, 1.25.3, 1.24.4, 1.23.6, and 1.22.9
contain a patch. The issue can also be mitigated by locking down OAuth
traffic, disabling the filter, or by filtering traffic before it
reaches the OAuth filter (e.g. via a lua script).

An issue was discovered in phpList before 3.6.14. Due to an access
error, it was possible to manipulate and edit data of the system's
super admin, allowing one to perform an account takeover of the user
with super-admin permission. Specifically, for a request with
updatepassword=1, a modified request (manipulating both the ID
parameter and the associated username) can bypass the intended email
confirmation requirement. For example, the attacker can start from an
updatepassword=1 request with their own ID number, and change the ID
number to 1 (representing the super admin account) and change the
username to admin2. In the first step, the attacker changes the super
admin's email address to one under the attacker's control. In the
second step, the attacker performs a password reset for the super
admin account. The new password allows login as the super admin, i.e.,
a successful account takeover.

flarum is a forum software package for building communities. In
versions prior to 1.7.0 an admin account which has already been
compromised by an attacker may use a vulnerability in the `LESS`
parser which can be exploited to read sensitive files on the server
through the use of path traversal techniques. An attacker can achieve
this by providing an absolute path to a sensitive file in the custom
`LESS` setting, which the `LESS` parser will then read. For example,
an attacker could use the following code to read the contents of the
`/etc/passwd` file on a linux machine. The scope of what files are
vulnerable will depend on the permissions given to the running flarum
process. The vulnerability has been addressed in version `1.7`. Users
should upgrade to this version to mitigate the vulnerability. Users
unable to upgrade may mitigate the vulnerability by ensuring that
their admin accounts are secured with strong passwords and follow
other best practices for account security. Additionally, users can
limit the exposure of sensitive files on the server by implementing
appropriate file permissions and access controls at the operating
system level.

Galaxy is an open-source platform for data analysis. All supported
versions of Galaxy are affected prior to 22.01, 22.05, and 23.0 are
affected by an insufficient permission check. Unsupported versions are
likely affected as far back as the functionality of
Visualizations/Pages exists. Due to this issue, an attacker can modify
or delete any Galaxy Visualization or Galaxy Page given they know the
encoded ID of it. Additionally, they can copy or import any Galaxy
Visualization given they know the encoded ID of it. Patches are
available for versions 22.01, 22.05, and 23.0. For the changes to take
effect, you must restart all Galaxy server processes. There are no
supported workarounds.

CodeIgniter Shield provides authentication and authorization for the
CodeIgniter 4 PHP framework. An improper implementation was found in
the password storage process. All hashed passwords stored in Shield
v1.0.0-beta.3 or earlier are easier to crack than expected due to the
vulnerability. Therefore, they should be removed as soon as possible.
If an attacker gets (1) the user's hashed password by Shield, and (2)
the hashed password (SHA-384 hash without salt) from somewhere, the
attacker may easily crack the user's password. Upgrade to Shield
v1.0.0-beta.4 or later to fix this issue. After upgrading, all users&#8217;
hashed passwords should be updated (saved to the database). There are
no known workarounds.

github-slug-action is a GitHub Action to expose slug value of GitHub
environment variables inside of one's GitHub workflow. Starting in
version 4.0.0` and prior to version 4.4.1, this action uses the
`github.head_ref` parameter in an insecure way. This vulnerability can
be triggered by any user on GitHub on any workflow using the action on
pull requests. They just need to create a pull request with a branch
name, which can contain the attack payload. This can be used to
execute code on the GitHub runners and to exfiltrate any secrets one
uses in the CI pipeline. A patched action is available in version
4.4.1. No workaround is available.

PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library
written in C. A buffer overflow vulnerability in versions 2.13 and
prior affects applications that use PJSIP DNS resolver. It doesn't
affect PJSIP users who do not utilise PJSIP DNS resolver. This
vulnerability is related to CVE-2022-24793. The difference is that
this issue is in parsing the query record `parse_query()`, while the
issue in CVE-2022-24793 is in `parse_rr()`. A patch is available as
commit `d1c5e4d` in the `master` branch. A workaround is to disable
DNS resolution in PJSIP config (by setting `nameserver_count` to zero)
or use an external resolver implementation instead.

Miniflux is a feed reader. Since v2.0.25, Miniflux will automatically
proxy images served over HTTP to prevent mixed content errors. When an
outbound request made by the Go HTTP client fails, the
`html.ServerError` is returned unescaped without the expected Content
Security Policy header added to valid responses. By creating an RSS
feed item with the inline description containing an `<img>` tag with a
`srcset` attribute pointing to an invalid URL like
`http:a<script>alert(1)</script>`, we can coerce the proxy handler
into an error condition where the invalid URL is returned unescaped
and in full. This results in JavaScript execution on the Miniflux
instance as soon as the user is convinced (e.g. by a message in the
alt text) to open the broken image. An attacker can execute arbitrary
JavaScript in the context of a victim Miniflux user when they open a
broken image in a crafted RSS feed. This can be used to perform
actions on the Miniflux instance as that user and gain administrative
access to the Miniflux instance if it is reachable and the victim is
an administrator. A patch is available in version 2.0.43. As a
workaround sisable image proxy; default value is `http-only`.

Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an
eBPF-based dataplane. Prior to versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1,
an attacker with access to a Cilium agent pod can write to
`/opt/cni/bin` due to a `hostPath` mount of that directory in the
agent pod. By replacing the CNI binary with their own malicious binary
and waiting for the creation of a new pod on the node, the attacker
can gain access to the underlying node. The issue has been fixed and
the fix is available on versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1. Some
workarounds are available. Kubernetes RBAC should be used to deny
users and service accounts `exec` access to Cilium agent pods. In
cases where a user requires `exec` access to Cilium agent pods, but
should not have access to the underlying node, no workaround is
possible.

Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an
eBPF-based dataplane. Prior to versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8, and 1.13.1,
under specific conditions, Cilium may misattribute the source IP
address of traffic to a cluster, identifying external traffic as
coming from the host on which Cilium is running. As a consequence,
network policies for that cluster might be bypassed, depending on the
specific network policies enabled. This issue only manifests when
Cilium is routing IPv6 traffic and NodePorts are used to route traffic
to pods. IPv6 and endpoint routes are both disabled by default. The
problem has been fixed and is available on versions 1.11.15, 1.12.8,
and 1.13.1. As a workaround, disable IPv6 routing.

Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an
eBPF-based dataplane. In version 1.13.0, when Cilium is started, there
is a short period when Cilium eBPF programs are not attached to the
host. During this period, the host does not implement any of Cilium's
featureset. This can cause disruption to newly established connections
during this period due to the lack of Load Balancing, or can cause
Network Policy bypass due to the lack of Network Policy enforcement
during the window. This vulnerability impacts any Cilium-managed
endpoints on the node (such as Kubernetes Pods), as well as the host
network namespace (including Host Firewall). This vulnerability is
fixed in Cilium 1.13.1 or later. Cilium releases 1.12.x, 1.11.x, and
earlier are not affected. There are no known workarounds.

OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
Prior to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed
SDP body is sent multiple times to an OpenSIPS configuration that
makes use of the `stream_process` function. This issue was discovered
during coverage guided fuzzing of the function
`codec_delete_except_re`. By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker
is able to crash the server. It affects configurations containing
functions that rely on the affected code, such as the function
`codec_delete_except_re`. This issue has been fixed in version 3.1.8
and 3.2.5.

OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
Prior to versions 3.1.8 and 3.2.5, when a specially crafted SIP
message is processed by the function `rewrite_ruri`, a crash occurs
due to a segmentation fault. This issue causes the server to crash. It
affects configurations containing functions that make use of the
affected code, such as the function `setport`. This issue has been
fixed in version 3.1.8 and 3.2.5.

OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, sending a malformed `Via` header to
OpenSIPS triggers a segmentation fault when the function
`calc_tag_suffix` is called. A specially crafted `Via` header, which
is deemed correct by the parser, will pass uninitialized strings to
the function `MD5StringArray` which leads to the crash. Abuse of this
vulnerability leads to Denial of Service due to a crash. Since the
uninitialized string points to memory location `0x0`, no further
exploitation appears to be possible. No special network privileges are
required to perform this attack, as long as the OpenSIPS configuration
makes use of functions such as `sl_send_reply` or `sl_gen_totag` that
trigger the vulnerable code. This issue has been fixed in versions
3.1.7 and 3.2.4.

OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, when the function `append_hf`
handles a SIP message with a malformed To header, a call to the
function `abort()` is performed, resulting in a crash. This is due to
the following check in `data_lump.c:399` in the function
`anchor_lump`. An attacker abusing this vulnerability will crash
OpenSIPS leading to Denial of Service. It affects configurations
containing functions that make use of the affected code, such as the
function `append_hf`. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and
3.2.4.

OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, OpenSIPS crashes when a malformed
SDP body is received and is processed by the `delete_sdp_line`
function in the sipmsgops module. This issue can be reproduced by
calling the function with an SDP body that does not terminate by a
line feed (i.e. `\n`). The vulnerability was found while performing
black-box fuzzing against an OpenSIPS server running a configuration
that made use of the functions `codec_delete_except_re` and
`codec_delete_re`. The same issue was also discovered while performing
coverage guided fuzzing on the function `codec_delete_except_re`. The
crash happens because the function `delete_sdp_line` expects that an
SDP line is terminated by a line feed (`\n`). By abusing this
vulnerability, an attacker is able to crash the server. It affects
configurations containing functions that rely on the affected code,
such as the function `codec_delete_except_re`. Due to the sanity check
that is performed in the `del_lump` function, exploitation of this
issue will generate an `abort` in the lumps processing function,
resulting in a Denial of Service. This issue is patched in versions
3.1.7 and 3.2.4.

The User Email Verification for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
vulnerable to authentication bypass via authenticate_user_by_email in
versions up to, and including, 3.5.0. This is due to a random token
generation weakness in the resend_verification_email function. This
allows unauthenticated attackers to impersonate users and trigger an
email address verification for arbitrary accounts, including
administrative accounts, and automatically be logged in as that user,
including any site administrators. This requires the Allow Automatic
Login After Successful Verification setting to be enabled, which it is
not by default.

A heap-based buffer overflow issue was discovered in libjpeg-turbo in
h2v2_merged_upsample_internal() function of jdmrgext.c file. The
vulnerability can only be exploited with 12-bit data precision for
which the range of the sample data type exceeds the valid sample
range, hence, an attacker could craft a 12-bit lossless JPEG image
that contains out-of-range 12-bit samples. An application attempting
to decompress such image using merged upsampling would lead to
segmentation fault or buffer overflows, causing an application to
crash.

OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
Versions prior to 3.1.7 and 3.2.4 have a potential issue in
`msg_translator.c:2628` which might lead to a server crash. This issue
was found while fuzzing the function `build_res_buf_from_sip_req` but
could not be reproduced against a running instance of OpenSIPS. This
issue could not be exploited against a running instance of OpenSIPS
since no public function was found to make use of this vulnerable
code. Even in the case of exploitation through unknown vectors, it is
highly unlikely that this issue would lead to anything other than
Denial of Service. This issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.7 and
3.2.4.

OpenSIPS, a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation,
has a memory leak starting in the 2.3 branch and priot to versions
3.1.8 and 3.2.5. The memory leak was detected in the function
`parse_mi_request` while performing coverage-guided fuzzing. This
issue can be reproduced by sending multiple requests of the form
`{"jsonrpc": "2.0","method": "log_le`. This malformed message was
tested against an instance of OpenSIPS via FIFO transport layer and
was found to increase the memory consumption over time. To abuse this
memory leak, attackers need to reach the management interface (MI)
which typically should only be exposed on trusted interfaces. In cases
where the MI is exposed to the internet without authentication, abuse
of this issue will lead to memory exhaustion which may affect the
underlying system&#8217;s availability. No authentication is typically
required to reproduce this issue. On the other hand, memory leaks may
occur in other areas of OpenSIPS where the cJSON library is used for
parsing JSON objects. The issue has been fixed in versions 3.1.8 and
3.2.5.

OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
Prior to versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6, a malformed SIP message containing
a large _Content-Length_ value and a specially crafted Request-URI
causes a segmentation fault in OpenSIPS. This issue occurs when a
large amount of shared memory using the `-m` flag was allocated to
OpenSIPS, such as 10 GB of RAM. On the test system, this issue
occurred when shared memory was set to `2362` or higher. This issue is
fixed in versions 3.1.9 and 3.2.6. The only workaround is to guarantee
that the Content-Length value of input messages is never larger than
`2147483647`.

OpenSIPS is a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) server implementation.
Prior to versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.4, a specially crafted Authorization
header causes OpenSIPS to crash or behave in an unexpected way due to
a bug in the function `parse_param_name()` . This issue was discovered
while performing coverage guided fuzzing of the function parse_msg.
The AddressSanitizer identified that the issue occurred in the
function `q_memchr()` which is being called by the function
`parse_param_name()`. This issue may cause erratic program behaviour
or a server crash. It affects configurations containing functions that

Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed
desktop applications on Linux. Versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8,
1.14.4, and 1.15.4 contain a vulnerability similar to CVE-2017-5226,
but using the `TIOCLINUX` ioctl command instead of `TIOCSTI`. If a
Flatpak app is run on a Linux virtual console such as `/dev/tty1`, it
can copy text from the virtual console and paste it into the command
buffer, from which the command might be run after the Flatpak app has
exited. Ordinary graphical terminal emulators like xterm, gnome-
terminal and Konsole are unaffected. This vulnerability is specific to
the Linux virtual consoles `/dev/tty1`, `/dev/tty2` and so on. A patch
is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and 1.15.4. As a
workaround, don't run Flatpak on a Linux virtual console. Flatpak is
primarily designed to be used in a Wayland or X11 graphical
environment.

Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed
desktop applications on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.8, 1.12.8,
1.14.4, and 1.15.4, if an attacker publishes a Flatpak app with
elevated permissions, they can hide those permissions from users of
the `flatpak(1)` command-line interface by setting other permissions
to crafted values that contain non-printable control characters such
as `ESC`. A fix is available in versions 1.10.8, 1.12.8, 1.14.4, and
1.15.4. As a workaround, use a GUI like GNOME Software rather than the
command-line interface, or only install apps whose maintainers you
trust.

discordrb is an implementation of the Discord API using Ruby. In
discordrb before commit `91e13043ffa` the `encoder.rb` file unsafely
constructs a shell string using the file parameter, which can
potentially leave clients of discordrb vulnerable to command
injection. The library is not directly exploitable: the exploit
requires that some client of the library calls the vulnerable method
with user input. However, if unsafe input reaches the library method,
then an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the host
machine. Full impact will depend on the permissions of the process
running the `discordrb` library and will likely not be total system
access. This issue has been addressed in code, but a new release of
the `discordrb` gem has not been uploaded to rubygems. This issue is
also tracked as `GHSL-2022-094`.

`cilium-cli` is the command line interface to install, manage, and
troubleshoot Kubernetes clusters running Cilium. Prior to version
0.13.2,`cilium-cli`, when used to configure cluster mesh
functionality, can remove the enforcement of user permissions on the
`etcd` store used to mirror local cluster information to remote
clusters. Users who have set up cluster meshes using the Cilium Helm
chart are not affected by this issue. Due to an incorrect mount point
specification, the settings specified by the `initContainer` that
configures `etcd` users and their permissions are overwritten when
using `cilium-cli` to configure a cluster mesh. An attacker who has
already gained access to a valid key and certificate for an `etcd`
cluster compromised in this manner could then modify state in that
`etcd` cluster. This issue is patched in `cilium-cli` 0.13.2. As a
workaround, one may use Cilium's Helm charts to create their cluster.

Snappy is a PHP library allowing thumbnail, snapshot or PDF generation
from a url or a html page. Prior to version 1.4.2, Snappy is
vulnerable to PHAR deserialization due to a lack of checking on the
protocol before passing it into the `file_exists()` function. If an
attacker can upload files of any type to the server he can pass in the
phar:// protocol to unserialize the uploaded file and instantiate
arbitrary PHP objects. This can lead to remote code execution
especially when snappy is used with frameworks with documented POP
chains like Laravel/Symfony vulnerable developer code. If a user can
control the output file from the `generateFromHtml()` function, it
will invoke deserialization. This vulnerability is capable of remote
code execution if Snappy is used with frameworks or developer code
with vulnerable POP chains. It has been fixed in version 1.4.2.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
internet of things (IoT) devices. In versions 4.8 and prior, an out-
of-bounds write can occur in the BLE L2CAP module of the Contiki-NG
operating system. The network stack of Contiki-NG uses a global buffer
(packetbuf) for processing of packets, with the size of
PACKETBUF_SIZE. In particular, when using the BLE L2CAP module with
the default configuration, the PACKETBUF_SIZE value becomes larger
then the actual size of the packetbuf. When large packets are
processed by the L2CAP module, a buffer overflow can therefore occur
when copying the packet data to the packetbuf. The vulnerability has
been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be
included in release 4.9. The problem can be worked around by applying
the patch manually.

Sentry SDK is the official Python SDK for Sentry, real-time crash
reporting software. When using the Django integration of versions
prior to 1.14.0 of the Sentry SDK in a specific configuration it is
possible to leak sensitive cookies values, including the session
cookie to Sentry. These sensitive cookies could then be used by
someone with access to your Sentry issues to impersonate or escalate
their privileges within your application. In order for these sensitive
values to be leaked, the Sentry SDK configuration must have
`sendDefaultPII` set to `True`; one must use a custom name for either
`SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` or `CSRF_COOKIE_NAME` in one's Django settings;
and one must not be configured in one's organization or project
settings to use Sentry's data scrubbing features to account for the
custom cookie names. As of version 1.14.0, the Django integration of
the `sentry-sdk` will detect the custom cookie names based on one's
Django settings and will remove the values from the payload before
sending the data to Sentry. As a workaround, use the SDK's filtering
mechanism to remove the cookies from the payload that is sent to
Sentry. For error events, this can be done with the `before_send`
callback method and for performance related events (transactions) one
can use the `before_send_transaction` callback method. Those who want
to handle filtering of these values on the server-side can also use
Sentry's advanced data scrubbing feature to account for the custom
cookie names. Look for the `$http.cookies`, `$http.headers`,
`$request.cookies`, or `$request.headers` fields to target with a
scrubbing rule.

`flate.NewReader` does not limit the size of the input. The user can
pass more than 1 MB of data in the HTTP request to the processing
functions, which will be decompressed server-side using the Deflate
algorithm. Therefore, after repeating the same request multiple times,
it is possible to achieve a reliable crash since the operating system
kills the process. This issue is patched in version 0.4.13.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20230621 ISC has disclosed two vulnerabilities in BIND 9 (CVE-2023-2828, CVE-2023-2911)
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/06/21/6

Every `named` instance configured to run as a recursive resolver
maintains a cache database holding the responses to the queries it has
recently sent to authoritative servers. The size limit for that cache
database can be configured using the `max-cache-size` statement in the
configuration file; it defaults to 90% of the total amount of memory
available on the host. When the size of the cache reaches 7/8 of the
configured limit, a cache-cleaning algorithm starts to remove expired
and/or least-recently used RRsets from the cache, to keep memory use
below the configured limit. It has been discovered that the
effectiveness of the cache-cleaning algorithm used in `named` can be
severely diminished by querying the resolver for specific RRsets in a
certain order, effectively allowing the configured `max-cache-size`
limit to be significantly exceeded. This issue affects BIND 9 versions
9.11.0 through 9.16.41, 9.18.0 through 9.18.15, 9.19.0 through
9.19.13, 9.11.3-S1 through 9.16.41-S1, and 9.18.11-S1 through
9.18.15-S1.

libcurl offers a feature to verify an SSH server's public key using a

A denial of service vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 in the way
libcurl provides several different backends for resolving host names,
selected at build time. If it is built to use the synchronous
resolver, it allows name resolves to time-out slow operations using
`alarm()` and `siglongjmp()`. When doing this, libcurl used a global
buffer that was not mutex protected and a multi-threaded application
might therefore crash or otherwise misbehave.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00016.html

An improper certificate validation vulnerability exists in curl
<v8.1.0 in the way it supports matching of wildcard patterns when
listed as "Subject Alternative Name" in TLS server certificates. curl
can be built to use its own name matching function for TLS rather than
one provided by a TLS library. This private wildcard matching function
would match IDN (International Domain Name) hosts incorrectly and
could as a result accept patterns that otherwise should mismatch. IDN
hostnames are converted to puny code before used for certificate
checks. Puny coded names always start with `xn--` and should not be
allowed to pattern match, but the wildcard check in curl could still
check for `x*`, which would match even though the IDN name most likely
contained nothing even resembling an `x`.

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in curl <v8.1.0 when
doing HTTP(S) transfers, libcurl might erroneously use the read
callback (`CURLOPT_READFUNCTION`) to ask for data to send, even when
the `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` option has been set, if the same handle
previously wasused to issue a `PUT` request which used that callback.
This flaw may surprise the application and cause it to misbehave and
either send off the wrong data or use memory after free or similar in
the second transfer. The problem exists in the logic for a reused
handle when it is (expected to be) changed from a PUT to a POST.

The Advanced Local Pickup for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is
vulnerable to time-based SQL Injection via the id parameter in
versions up to, and including, 1.5.5 due to insufficient escaping on
the user supplied parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the
existing SQL query. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers
with admin-level privileges to append additional SQL queries into
already existing queries that can be used to extract sensitive
information from the database.

matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for
JavaScript. In versions prior to 24.0.0 events sent with special
strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-
sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's
ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear
to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data
presented to the consumer. This vulnerability is distinct from GHSA-
rfv9-x7hh-xc32 which covers a similar issue. The issue has been
patched in matrix-js-sdk 24.0.0 and users are advised to upgrade.

Frontier is an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate. Frontier's
`modexp` precompile uses `num-bigint` crate under the hood. In the
implementation prior to pull request 1017, the cases for modulus being
even and modulus being odd are treated separately. Odd modulus uses
the fast Montgomery multiplication, and even modulus uses the slow
plain power algorithm. This gas cost discrepancy was not accounted for
in the `modexp` precompile, leading to possible denial of service
attacks. No fixes for `num-bigint` are currently available, and thus
this issue is fixed in the short term by raising the gas costs for
even modulus, and in the long term fixing it in `num-bigint` or
switching to another modexp implementation. The short-term fix for
Frontier is deployed at pull request 1017. There are no known
workarounds aside from applying the fix.

bypass metadata bucket name checking and put an object into any bucket
while processing `PostPolicyBucket`. To carry out this attack, the
attacker requires credentials with `arn:aws:s3:::*` permission, as
well as enabled Console API access. This issue has been patched in
RELEASE.2023-03-20T20-16-18Z. As a workaround, enable browser API
access and turn off `MINIO_BROWSER=off`.

Tailscale is software for using Wireguard and multi-factor
authentication (MFA). A vulnerability identified in the implementation
of Tailscale SSH starting in version 1.34.0 and prior to prior to
1.38.2 in FreeBSD allows commands to be run with a higher privilege
group ID than that specified in Tailscale SSH access rules. A
difference in the behavior of the FreeBSD `setgroups` system call from
POSIX meant that the Tailscale client running on a FreeBSD-based
operating system did not appropriately restrict groups on the host
when using Tailscale SSH. When accessing a FreeBSD host over Tailscale
SSH, the egid of the tailscaled process was used instead of that of
the user specified in Tailscale SSH access rules. Tailscale SSH
commands may have been run with a higher privilege group ID than that
specified in Tailscale SSH access rules if they met all of the
following criteria: the destination node was a FreeBSD device with
Tailscale SSH enabled; Tailscale SSH access rules permitted access for
non-root users; and a non-interactive SSH session was used. Affected
users should upgrade to version 1.38.2 to remediate the issue.

CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor.
A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered affecting
Iframe Dialog and Media Embed packages. The vulnerability may trigger
a JavaScript code after fulfilling special conditions: using one of
the affected packages on a web page with missing proper Content
Security Policy configuration; initializing the editor on an element
and using an element other than `<textarea>` as a base; and destroying
the editor instance. This vulnerability might affect a small
percentage of integrators that depend on dynamic editor
initialization/destroy mechanism. A fix is available in CKEditor4
version 4.21.0. In some rare cases, a security fix may be considered a
breaking change. Starting from version 4.21.0, the Iframe Dialog
plugin applies the `sandbox` attribute by default, which restricts
JavaScript code execution in the iframe element. To change this
behavior, configure the `config.iframe_attributes` option. Also
starting from version 4.21.0, the Media Embed plugin regenerates the
entire content of the embed widget by default. To change this
behavior, configure the `config.embed_keepOriginalContent` option.
Those who choose to enable either of the more permissive options or
who cannot upgrade to a patched version should properly configure
Content Security Policy to avoid any potential security issues that
may arise from embedding iframe elements on their web page.

GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation,
sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. Prior to versions
2.20.6, 2.19.6, and 2.18.7, anonymous users can obtain sensitive
information about GeoNode configurations from the response of the
`/geoserver/rest/about/status` Geoserver REST API endpoint. The
Geoserver endpoint is secured by default, but the configuration of
Geoserver for GeoNode opens a list of REST endpoints to support some
of its public-facing services. The vulnerability impacts both GeoNode
3 and GeoNode 4 instances. Geoserver security configuration is
provided by `geoserver-geonode-ext`. A patch for 2.20.7 has been
released which blocks access to the affected endpoint. The patch has
been backported to branches 2.20.6, 2.19.7, 2.19.6, and 2.18.7. All
the published artifacts and Docker images have been updated
accordingly. A more advanced patch has been applied to the master and
development versions, which require some changes to GeoNode code. They
will be available with the next 4.1.0 release. The patched
configuration only has an effect on new deployments. For existing
setups, the patch must be applied manually inside the Geoserver data
directory. The patched file must replace the existing
`<geoserver_datadir>/security/rest.properties` file.

angular-server-side-configuration helps configure an angular
application at runtime on the server or in a docker container via
environment variables. angular-server-side-configuration detects used
environment variables in TypeScript (.ts) files during build time of
an Angular CLI project. The detected environment variables are written
to a ngssc.json file in the output directory. During deployment of an
Angular based app, the environment variables based on the variables
from ngssc.json are inserted into the apps index.html (or defined
index file). With version 15.0.0 the environment variable detection
was widened to the entire project, relative to the angular.json file
from the Angular CLI. In a monorepo setup, this could lead to
environment variables intended for a backend/service to be detected
and written to the ngssc.json, which would then be populated and
exposed via index.html. This has NO IMPACT, in a plain Angular project
that has no backend component. This vulnerability has been mitigated
in version 15.1.0, by adding an option `searchPattern` which restricts
the detection file range by default. As a workaround, manually edit or
create ngssc.json or run script after ngssc.json generation.

Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is
built in Rust. Resizable ArrayBuffers passed to asynchronous functions
that are shrunk during the asynchronous operation could result in an
out-of-bound read/write. It is unlikely that this has been exploited
in the wild, as the only version affected is Deno 1.32.0. Deno Deploy
users are not affected. The problem has been resolved by disabling
resizable ArrayBuffers temporarily in Deno 1.32.1. Deno 1.32.2 will
re-enable resizable ArrayBuffers with a proper fix. As a workaround,
run with `--v8-flags=--no-harmony-rab-gsab` to disable resizable
ArrayBuffers.

Deno is a simple, modern and secure runtime for JavaScript and
TypeScript that uses V8 and is built in Rust. Arbitrary program names
without any ANSI filtering allows any malicious program to clear the
first 2 lines of a `op_spawn_child` or `op_kill` prompt and replace it
with any desired text. This works with any command on the respective
platform, giving the program the full ability to choose what program
they wanted to run. This problem can not be exploited on systems that
do not attach an interactive prompt (for example headless servers).
This issue has been patched in version 1.31.2.

Versionize is a framework for version tolerant
serializion/deserialization of Rust data structures, designed for
usecases that need fast deserialization times and minimal size
overhead. An issue was discovered in the &#8216;Versionize::deserialize&#8217;
implementation provided by the &#8216;versionize&#8217; crate for
&#8216;vmm_sys_utils::fam::FamStructWrapper', which can lead to out of
bounds memory accesses. The impact started with version 0.1.1. The
issue was corrected in version 0.1.10 by inserting a check that
verifies, for any deserialized header, the lengths of compared
flexible arrays are equal and aborting deserialization otherwise.

Name: CVE-2023-28500
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://coastalsecurity.gitbook.io/critical-vulnerability-adobe-livecycle-es4v11.0/

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** A Java insecure deserialization
vulnerability in Adobe LiveCycle ES4 version 11.0 and earlier allows
unauthenticated remote attackers to gain operating system code
execution by submitting specially crafted Java serialized objects to a
specific URL. Adobe LiveCycle ES4 version 11.0.1 and later may be
vulnerable if the application is installed with Java environment 7u21
and earlier. Exploitation of the vulnerability depends on two factors:
insecure deserialization methods used in the Adobe LiveCycle
application, and the use of Java environments 7u21 and earlier. The
code execution is performed in the context of the account that is
running the Adobe LiveCycle application. If the account is privileged,
exploitation provides privileged access to the operating system. NOTE:
This vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported
by the maintainer.
