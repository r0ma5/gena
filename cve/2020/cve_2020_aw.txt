Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ap-ip-flood-dos-6hxxENVQ

A vulnerability in IP ingress packet processing of the Cisco Embedded
Wireless Controller with Catalyst Access Points Software could allow
an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the device to reload
unexpectedly, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition. The device
may experience a performance degradation in traffic processing or high
CPU usage prior to the unexpected reload. This vulnerability is due to
improper rate limiting of IP packets to the management interface. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a steady stream
of IP traffic at a high rate to the management interface of the
affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
cause the device to reload.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-bfd-dos-wGQXrzxn

A vulnerability in the rate limiter for Bidirectional Forwarding
Detection (BFD) traffic of Cisco NX-OS Software for Cisco Nexus 9000
Series Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
cause BFD traffic to be dropped on an affected device. This
vulnerability is due to a logic error in the BFD rate limiter
functionality. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
a crafted stream of traffic through the device. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to cause BFD traffic to be dropped, resulting
in BFD session flaps. BFD session flaps can cause route instability
and dropped traffic, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
This vulnerability applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

A vulnerability in the Cisco Fabric Services over IP (CFSoIP) feature
of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected
device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of
incoming CFSoIP packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability
by sending crafted CFSoIP packets to an affected device. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to
reload, resulting in a DoS condition.

condition. This vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of a
specific RPKI to Router (RTR) Protocol packet header. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by compromising the RPKI validator
server and sending a specifically crafted RTR packet to an affected
device. Alternatively, the attacker could use man-in-the-middle
techniques to impersonate the RPKI validator server and send a crafted
RTR response packet over the established RTR TCP connection to the
affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
cause a DoS condition because the BGP process could constantly restart
and BGP routing could become unstable.

Reference: CISCO:20220413 Cisco Wireless LAN Controller Management Interface Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-wlc-auth-bypass-JRNhV4fF

A vulnerability in the authentication functionality of Cisco Wireless
LAN Controller (WLC) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote
attacker to bypass authentication controls and log in to the device
through the management interface This vulnerability is due to the
improper implementation of the password validation algorithm. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by logging in to an affected
device with crafted credentials. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to bypass authentication and log in to the device as an
administrator. The attacker could obtain privileges that are the same
level as an administrative user but it depends on the crafted
credentials. Note: This vulnerability exists because of a non-default
device configuration that must be present for it to be exploitable.
For details about the vulnerable configuration, see the Vulnerable
Products section of this advisory.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-vmanage-msg-serv-AqTup7vs

A vulnerability in the binding configuration of Cisco SD-WAN vManage
Software containers could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker
who has access to the VPN0 logical network to also access the
messaging service ports on an affected system. This vulnerability
exists because the messaging server container ports on an affected
system lack sufficient protection mechanisms. An attacker could
exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the messaging service
ports of the affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the
attacker must be able to send network traffic to interfaces within the
VPN0 logical network. This network may be restricted to protect
logical or physical adjacent networks, depending on device deployment
configuration. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to view
and inject messages into the messaging service, which can cause
configuration changes or cause the system to reload.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asaftd-rsa-key-leak-Ms7UEfZz

A vulnerability in the handling of RSA keys on devices running Cisco
Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat
Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to retrieve an RSA private key. This vulnerability is due to a logic
error when the RSA key is stored in memory on a hardware platform that
performs hardware-based cryptography. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by using a Lenstra side-channel attack against the
targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
retrieve the RSA private key. The following conditions may be observed
on an affected device: This vulnerability will apply to approximately
5 percent of the RSA keys on a device that is running a vulnerable
release of Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software; not all RSA keys
are expected to be affected due to mathematical calculations applied
to the RSA key. The RSA key could be valid but have specific
characteristics that make it vulnerable to the potential leak of the
RSA private key. If an attacker obtains the RSA private key, they
could use the key to impersonate a device that is running Cisco ASA
Software or Cisco FTD Software or to decrypt the device traffic. See
the Indicators of Compromise section for more information on the
detection of this type of RSA key. The RSA key could be malformed and
invalid. A malformed RSA key is not functional, and a TLS client
connection to a device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD
Software that uses the malformed RSA key will result in a TLS
signature failure, which means a vulnerable software release created
an invalid RSA signature that failed verification. If an attacker
obtains the RSA private key, they could use the key to impersonate a
device that is running Cisco ASA Software or Cisco FTD Software or to
decrypt the device traffic.

This affects the package convict before 6.2.3. This is a bypass of
[CVE-2022-22143](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-
CONVICT-2340604). The [fix](https://github.com/mozilla/node-
convict/commit/3b86be087d8f14681a9c889d45da7fe3ad9cd880) introduced,
relies on the startsWith method and does not prevent the
vulnerability: before splitting the path, it checks if it starts with
__proto__ or this.constructor.prototype. To bypass this check it's
possible to prepend the dangerous paths with any string value followed
by a dot, like for example foo.__proto__ or
foo.this.constructor.prototype.

An out-of-bounds read vulnerability was found in Samba due to
insufficient length checks in winbindd_pam_auth_crap.c. When
performing NTLM authentication, the client replies to cryptographic
challenges back to the server. These replies have variable lengths,
and Winbind fails to check the lan manager response length. When
Winbind is used for NTLM authentication, a maliciously crafted request
can trigger an out-of-bounds read in Winbind, possibly resulting in a
crash.

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#8217;s KVM when attempting to set a
SynIC IRQ. This issue makes it possible for a misbehaving VMM to write
to SYNIC/STIMER MSRs, causing a NULL pointer dereference. This flaw
allows an unprivileged local attacker on the host to issue specific
ioctl calls, causing a kernel oops condition that results in a denial
of service.

SpiceDB is a database system for managing security-critical
application permissions. Any user making use of a wildcard
relationship under the right hand branch of an `exclusion` or within
an `intersection` operation will see `Lookup`/`LookupResources` return
a resource as "accessible" if it is *not* accessible by virtue of the
inclusion of the wildcard in the intersection or the right side of the
exclusion. In `v1.3.0`, the wildcard is ignored entirely in lookup's
dispatch, resulting in the `banned` wildcard being ignored in the
exclusion. Version 1.4.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a
workaround, don't make use of wildcards on the right side of
intersections or within exclusions.

Convos is an open source multi-user chat that runs in a web browser.
You can't use SVG extension in Convos' chat window, but you can upload
a file with an .html extension. By uploading an SVG file with an html
extension the upload filter can be bypassed. This causes Stored XSS.
Also, after uploading a file the XSS attack is triggered upon a user
viewing the file. Through this vulnerability, an attacker is capable
to execute malicious scripts. Users are advised to update as soon as
possible.

Shopware is an open source e-commerce software platform. In affected
versions shopware would not invalidate a user session in the event of
a password change. With version 5.7.7 the session validation was
adjusted, so that sessions created prior to the latest password change
of a customer account can't be used to login with said account. This
also means, that upon a password change, all existing sessions for a
given customer account are automatically considered invalid. There is
no workaround for this issue.

Jawn is an open source JSON parser. Extenders of the
`org.typelevel.jawn.SimpleFacade` and
`org.typelevel.jawn.MutableFacade` who don't override
`objectContext()` are vulnerable to a hash collision attack which may
result in a denial of service. Most applications do not implement
these traits directly, but inherit from a library. `jawn-parser-1.3.1`
fixes this issue and users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to
upgrade override `objectContext()` to use a collision-safe collection.

Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-
native applications. The default_validator.cc implementation used to
implement the default certificate validation routines has a "type
confusion" bug when processing subjectAltNames. This processing
allows, for example, an rfc822Name or uniformResourceIndicator to be
authenticated as a domain name. This confusion allows for the
bypassing of nameConstraints, as processed by the underlying
OpenSSL/BoringSSL implementation, exposing the possibility of
impersonation of arbitrary servers. As a result Envoy will trust
upstream certificates that should not be trusted.

Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-
native applications. In affected versions Envoy does not restrict the
set of certificates it accepts from the peer, either as a TLS client
or a TLS server, to only those certificates that contain the necessary
extendedKeyUsage (id-kp-serverAuth and id-kp-clientAuth,
respectively). This means that a peer may present an e-mail
certificate (e.g. id-kp-emailProtection), either as a leaf certificate
or as a CA in the chain, and it will be accepted for TLS. This is
particularly bad when combined with the issue described in pull
request #630, in that it allows a Web PKI CA that is intended only for
use with S/MIME, and thus exempted from audit or supervision, to issue
TLS certificates that will be accepted by Envoy. As a result Envoy
will trust upstream certificates that should not be trusted. There are
no known workarounds to this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language
designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency. The
Rust Security Response WG was notified that the
`std::fs::remove_dir_all` standard library function is vulnerable a
race condition enabling symlink following (CWE-363). An attacker could
use this security issue to trick a privileged program into deleting
files and directories the attacker couldn't otherwise access or
delete. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.58.0 is affected by this
vulnerability with 1.58.1 containing a patch. Note that the following
build targets don't have usable APIs to properly mitigate the attack,
and are thus still vulnerable even with a patched toolchain: macOS
before version 10.10 (Yosemite) and REDOX. We recommend everyone to
update to Rust 1.58.1 as soon as possible, especially people
developing programs expected to run in privileged contexts (including
system daemons and setuid binaries), as those have the highest risk of
being affected by this. Note that adding checks in your codebase
before calling remove_dir_all will not mitigate the vulnerability, as
they would also be vulnerable to race conditions like remove_dir_all
itself. The existing mitigation is working as intended outside of race
conditions.

could not read the body of a request. In the event that a POST request
is sent to any endpoint of the server with an empty body, even
unauthenticated with the Pusher Protocol, it will crash the server.
All users that run the server are affected by this vulnerability and
it's highly recommended to upgrade to the latest patch. There are no
workarounds for this issue.

pipenv is a Python development workflow tool. Starting with version
2018.10.9 and prior to version 2022.1.8, a flaw in pipenv's parsing of
requirements files allows an attacker to insert a specially crafted
string inside a comment anywhere within a requirements.txt file, which
will cause victims who use pipenv to install the requirements file to
download dependencies from a package index server controlled by the
attacker. By embedding malicious code in packages served from their
malicious index server, the attacker can trigger arbitrary remote code
execution (RCE) on the victims' systems. If an attacker is able to
hide a malicious `--index-url` option in a requirements file that a
victim installs with pipenv, the attacker can embed arbitrary
malicious code in packages served from their malicious index server
that will be executed on the victim's host during installation (remote
code execution/RCE). When pip installs from a source distribution, any
code in the setup.py is executed by the install process. This issue is
patched in version 2022.1.8. The GitHub Security Advisory contains
more information about this vulnerability.

@replit/crosis is a JavaScript client that speaks Replit's container
protocol. A vulnerability that involves exposure of sensitive
information exists in versions prior to 7.3.1. When using this library
as a way to programmatically communicate with Replit in a standalone
fashion, if there are multiple failed attempts to contact Replit
through a WebSocket, the library will attempt to communicate using a
fallback poll-based proxy. The URL of the proxy has changed, so any
communication done to the previous URL could potentially reach a
server that is outside of Replit's control and the token used to
connect to the Repl could be obtained by an attacker, leading to full
compromise of that Repl (not of the account). This was patched in
version 7.3.1 by updating the address of the fallback WebSocket
polling proxy to the new one. As a workaround, a user may specify the
new address for the polling host (`gp-v2.replit.com`) in the
`ConnectArgs`. More information about this workaround is available in
the GitHub Security Advisory.

make-ca is a utility to deliver and manage a complete PKI
configuration for workstations and servers. Starting with version 0.9
and prior to version 1.10, make-ca misinterprets Mozilla certdata.txt
and treats explicitly untrusted certificates like trusted ones,
causing those explicitly untrusted certificates trusted by the system.
The explicitly untrusted certificates were used by some CAs already
hacked. Hostile attackers may perform a MIM attack exploiting them.
Everyone using the affected versions of make-ca should upgrade to
make-ca-1.10, and run `make-ca -f -g` as the `root` user to regenerate
the trusted store immediately. As a workaround, users may delete the
untrusted certificates from /etc/pki/tls and /etc/ssl/certs manually
(or by a script), but this is not recommended because the manual
changes will be overwritten next time running make-ca to update the
trusted anchor.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
In affected versions when a data source has the Forward OAuth Identity
feature enabled, sending a query to that datasource with an API token
(and no other user credentials) will forward the OAuth Identity of the
most recently logged-in user. This can allow API token holders to
retrieve data for which they may not have intended access. This attack
relies on the Grafana instance having data sources that support the
Forward OAuth Identity feature, the Grafana instance having a data
source with the Forward OAuth Identity feature toggled on, the Grafana
instance having OAuth enabled, and the Grafana instance having usable
API keys. This issue has been patched in versions 7.5.13 and 8.3.4.

Bytecode Viewer (BCV) is a Java/Android reverse engineering suite.
Versions of the package prior to 2.11.0 are vulnerable to Arbitrary
File Write via Archive Extraction (AKA "Zip Slip"). The vulnerability
is exploited using a specially crafted archive that holds directory
traversal filenames (e.g. ../../evil.exe). The Zip Slip vulnerability
can affect numerous archive formats, including zip, jar, tar, war,
cpio, apk, rar and 7z. The attacker can then overwrite executable
files and either invoke them remotely or wait for the system or user
to call them, thus achieving remote command execution on the victim&#8217;s
machine. The impact of a Zip Slip vulnerability would allow an
attacker to create or overwrite existing files on the filesystem. In
the context of a web application, a web shell could be placed within
the application directory to achieve code execution. All users should
upgrade to BCV v2.11.0 when possible to receive a patch. There are no
recommended workarounds aside from upgrading.

Engine.IO is the implementation of transport-based cross-
browser/cross-device bi-directional communication layer for Socket.IO.
A specially crafted HTTP request can trigger an uncaught exception on
the Engine.IO server, thus killing the Node.js process. This impacts
all the users of the `engine.io` package starting from version
`4.0.0`, including those who uses depending packages like `socket.io`.
Versions prior to `4.0.0` are not impacted. A fix has been released
for each major branch, namely `4.1.2` for the `4.x.x` branch, `5.2.1`
for the `5.x.x` branch, and `6.1.1` for the `6.x.x` branch. There is
no known workaround except upgrading to a safe version.

Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Discourse groups can
be configured with varying visibility levels for the group as well as
the group members. By default, a newly created group has its
visibility set to public and the group's members visibility set to
public as well. However, a group's visibility and the group's members
visibility can be configured such that it is restricted to logged on
users, members of the group or staff users. A vulnerability has been
discovered in versions prior to 2.7.13 and 2.8.0.beta11 where the
group advanced search option does not respect the group's visibility
and members visibility level. As such, a group with restricted
visibility or members visibility can be revealed through search with
the right search option. This issue is patched in `stable` version
2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed` version
2.8.0.beta11 versions of Discourse. There are no workarounds aside

Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework.
A path traversal vulnerability affects versions of Flatpak prior to
1.12.3 and 1.10.6. flatpak-builder applies `finish-args` last in the
build. At this point the build directory will have the full access
that is specified in the manifest, so running `flatpak build` against
it will gain those permissions. Normally this will not be done, so
this is not problem. However, if `--mirror-screenshots-url` is
specified, then flatpak-builder will launch `flatpak build
--nofilesystem=host appstream-utils mirror-screenshots` after
finalization, which can lead to issues even with the
`--nofilesystem=host` protection. In normal use, the only issue is
that these empty directories can be created wherever the user has
write permissions. However, a malicious application could replace the
`appstream-util` binary and potentially do something more hostile.
This has been resolved in Flatpak 1.12.3 and 1.10.6 by changing the

Wagtail is a Django based content management system focused on
flexibility and user experience. When notifications for new replies in
comment threads are sent, they are sent to all users who have replied
or commented anywhere on the site, rather than only in the relevant
threads. This means that a user could listen in to new comment replies
on pages they have not have editing access to, as long as they have
left a comment or reply somewhere on the site. A patched version has
been released as Wagtail 2.15.2, which restores the intended behaviour
- to send notifications for new replies to the participants in the
active thread only (editing permissions are not considered). New
comments can be disabled by setting `WAGTAILADMIN_COMMENTS_ENABLED =
False` in the Django settings file.

Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Versions prior to
2.7.13 in `stable`, 2.8.0.beta11 in `beta`, and 2.8.0.beta11 in
`tests-passed` allow some users to log in to a community before they
should be able to do so. A user invited via email to a forum with
`must_approve_users` enabled is going to be automatically logged in,
bypassing the check that does not allow unapproved users to sign in.
They will be able to do everything an approved user can do. If they
logout, they cannot log back in. This issue is patched in the `stable`
version 2.7.13, `beta` version 2.8.0.beta11, and `tests-passed`
version 2.8.0.beta11. One may disable invites as a workaround.
Administrators can increase `min_trust_level_to_allow_invite` to
reduce the attack surface to more trusted users.

Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit
number `8a93fdc6c9f4eb1d2f2a11b7ff1d12d70bf5a664`, a bug in Frontier's
MODEXP precompile implementation can cause an integer underflow in
certain conditions. This will cause a node crash for debug builds. For
release builds (and production WebAssembly binaries), the impact is
limited as it can only cause a normal EVM out-of-gas. Users who do not
use MODEXP precompile in their runtime are not impacted. A patch is
available in pull request #549.

gh-ost is a triggerless online schema migration solution for MySQL.
Versions prior to 1.1.3 are subject to an arbitrary file read
vulnerability. The attacker must have access to the target host or
trick an administrator into executing a malicious gh-ost command on a
host running gh-ost, plus network access from host running gh-ost to
the attack's malicious MySQL server. The `-database` parameter does
not properly sanitize user input which can lead to arbitrary file

OnionShare is an open source tool that lets you securely and
anonymously share files, host websites, and chat with friends using
the Tor network. Affected versions of the desktop application were
found to be vulnerable to denial of service via an undisclosed
vulnerability in the QT image parsing. Roughly 20 bytes lead to 2GB
memory consumption and this can be triggered multiple times. To be
abused, this vulnerability requires rendering in the history tab, so
some user interaction is required. An adversary with knowledge of the
Onion service address in public mode or with authentication in private
mode can perform a Denial of Service attack, which quickly results in
out-of-memory for the server. This requires the desktop application
with rendered history, therefore the impact is only elevated. This
issue has been patched in version 2.5.

Jupyter Server Proxy is a Jupyter notebook server extension to proxy
web services. Versions of Jupyter Server Proxy prior to 3.2.1 are
vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). Any user deploying
Jupyter Server or Notebook with jupyter-proxy-server extension enabled
is affected. A lack of input validation allows authenticated clients
to proxy requests to other hosts, bypassing the `allowed_hosts` check.
Because authentication is required, which already grants permissions
to make the same requests via kernel or terminal execution, this is
considered low to moderate severity. Users may upgrade to version
3.2.1 to receive a patch or, as a workaround, install the patch
manually.

client_golang is the instrumentation library for Go applications in
Prometheus, and the promhttp package in client_golang provides tooling
around HTTP servers and clients. In client_golang prior to version
1.11.1, HTTP server is susceptible to a Denial of Service through
unbounded cardinality, and potential memory exhaustion, when handling
requests with non-standard HTTP methods. In order to be affected, an
instrumented software must use any of `promhttp.InstrumentHandler*`
middleware except `RequestsInFlight`; not filter any specific methods
(e.g GET) before middleware; pass metric with `method` label name to
our middleware; and not have any firewall/LB/proxy that filters away
requests with unknown `method`. client_golang version 1.11.1 contains
a patch for this issue. Several workarounds are available, including
removing the `method` label name from counter/gauge used in the
InstrumentHandler; turning off affected promhttp handlers; adding
custom middleware before promhttp handler that will sanitize the
request method given by Go http.Request; and using a reverse proxy or
web application firewall, configured to only allow a limited set of
methods.

Micronaut is a JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for
building JVM web applications with support for Java, Kotlin and the
Groovy language. In affected versions sending an invalid Content Type
header leads to memory leak in DefaultArgumentConversionContext as
this type is erroneously used in static state. ### Impact Sending an
invalid Content Type header leads to memory leak in
`DefaultArgumentConversionContext` as this type is erroneously used in
static state. ### Patches The problem is patched in Micronaut 3.2.7
and above. ### Workarounds The default content type binder can be
replaced in an existing Micronaut application to mitigate the issue:
```java package example; import java.util.List; import
io.micronaut.context.annotation.Replaces; import
io.micronaut.core.convert.ConversionService; import
io.micronaut.http.MediaType; import
io.micronaut.http.bind.DefaultRequestBinderRegistry; import
io.micronaut.http.bind.binders.RequestArgumentBinder; import
jakarta.inject.Singleton; @Singleton
@Replaces(DefaultRequestBinderRegistry.class) class
FixedRequestBinderRegistry extends DefaultRequestBinderRegistry {
public FixedRequestBinderRegistry(ConversionService conversionService,
List<RequestArgumentBinder> binders) { super(conversionService,
binders); } @Override protected void

Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure
microservices. In versions 1.12.0 and 1.12.1 Istio is vulnerable to a
privilege escalation attack. Users who have `CREATE` permission for
`gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io` objects can escalate this
privilege to create other resources that they may not have access to,
such as `Pod`. This vulnerability impacts only an Alpha level feature,
the Kubernetes Gateway API. This is not the same as the Istio Gateway
type (gateways.networking.istio.io), which is not vulnerable. Users
are advised to upgrade to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade
should implement any of the following which will prevent this
vulnerability: Remove the gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io
CustomResourceDefinition, set
PILOT_ENABLE_GATEWAY_API_DEPLOYMENT_CONTROLLER=true environment
variable in Istiod, or remove CREATE permissions for
gateways.gateway.networking.k8s.io objects from untrusted users.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
In affected versions an attacker could serve HTML content thru the
Grafana datasource or plugin proxy and trick a user to visit this HTML
page using a specially crafted link and execute a Cross-site Scripting
(XSS) attack. The attacker could either compromise an existing
datasource for a specific Grafana instance or either set up its own
public service and instruct anyone to set it up in their Grafana
instance. To be impacted, all of the following must be applicable. For
the data source proxy: A Grafana HTTP-based datasource configured with
Server as Access Mode and a URL set, the attacker has to be in control
of the HTTP server serving the URL of above datasource, and a
specially crafted link pointing at the attacker controlled data source
must be clicked on by an authenticated user. For the plugin proxy: A
Grafana HTTP-based app plugin configured and enabled with a URL set,
the attacker has to be in control of the HTTP server serving the URL
of above app, and a specially crafted link pointing at the attacker
controlled plugin must be clocked on by an authenticated user. For the
backend plugin resource: An attacker must be able to navigate an
authenticated user to a compromised plugin through a crafted link.
Users are advised to update to a patched version. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
Affected versions are subject to a cross site request forgery
vulnerability which allows attackers to elevate their privileges by
mounting cross-origin attacks against authenticated high-privilege
Grafana users (for example, Editors or Admins). An attacker can
exploit this vulnerability for privilege escalation by tricking an
authenticated user into inviting the attacker as a new user with high
privileges. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There
are no known workarounds for this issue.

Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with topic-based
threading. Zulip Server version 2.0.0 and above are vulnerable to
insufficient access control with multi-use invitations. A Zulip Server
deployment which hosts multiple organizations is vulnerable to an
attack where an invitation created in one organization (potentially as
a role with elevated permissions) can be used to join any other
organization. This bypasses any restrictions on required domains on
users' email addresses, may be used to gain access to organizations
which are only accessible by invitation, and may be used to gain
access with elevated privileges. This issue has been patched in
release 4.10. There are no known workarounds for this issue. ###

wasmCloud Host Runtime is a server process that securely hosts and
provides dispatch for web assembly (WASM) actors and capability
providers. In versions prior to 0.52.2 actors can bypass capability
authorization. Actors are normally required to declare their
capabilities for inbound invocations, but with this vulnerability
actor capability claims are not verified upon receiving invocations.
This compromises the security model for actors as they can receive
unauthorized invocations from linked capability providers. The problem
has been patched in versions `0.52.2` and greater. There is no
workaround and users are advised to upgrade to an unaffected version
as soon as possible.

graphql-go is a GraphQL server with a focus on ease of use. In
versions prior to 1.3.0 there exists a DoS vulnerability that is
possible due to a bug in the library that would allow an attacker with
specifically designed queries to cause stack overflow panics. Any user
with access to the GraphQL handler can send these queries and cause
stack overflows. This in turn could potentially compromise the ability
of the server to serve data to its users. The issue has been patched
in version `v1.3.0`. The only known workaround for this issue is to
disable the `graphql.MaxDepth` option from your schema which is not
recommended.

Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications,
supporting Python 3.6+. Prior to 22.2.0, Twisted SSH client and server
implement is able to accept an infinite amount of data for the peer's
SSH version identifier. This ends up with a buffer using all the
available memory. The attach is a simple as `nc -rv localhost 22 <
/dev/zero`. A patch is available in version 22.2.0. There are
currently no known workarounds.

Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop
applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in
versions prior to `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and
`13.6.6` allows renderers to obtain access to a bluetooth device via
the web bluetooth API if the app has not configured a custom `select-
bluetooth-device` event handler. This has been patched and Electron
versions `17.0.0-alpha.6`, `16.0.6`, `15.3.5`, `14.2.4`, and `13.6.6`
contain the fix. Code from the GitHub Security Advisory can be added
to the app to work around the issue.

with similar environments where invalid requests are filtered before
reaching Next.js, are not affected. A patch has been released,
`next@12.0.9`, that mitigates this issue. As a workaround, one may
ensure `/${locale}/_next/` is blocked from reaching the Next.js
instance until it becomes feasible to upgrade.

pgjdbc is the offical PostgreSQL JDBC Driver. A security hole was
found in the jdbc driver for postgresql database while doing security
research. The system using the postgresql library will be attacked
when attacker control the jdbc url or properties. pgjdbc instantiates
plugin instances based on class names provided via
`authenticationPluginClassName`, `sslhostnameverifier`,
`socketFactory`, `sslfactory`, `sslpasswordcallback` connection
properties. However, the driver did not verify if the class implements
the expected interface before instantiating the class. This can lead
to code execution loaded via arbitrary classes. Users using plugins
are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The estimator
for the cost of some convolution operations can be made to execute a
division by 0. The function fails to check that the stride argument is
strictly positive. Hence, the fix is to add a check for the stride
argument to ensure it is valid. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1,
TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and
still in supported range.

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The
implementation of `Dequantize` does not fully validate the value of
`axis` and can result in heap OOB accesses. The `axis` argument can be
`-1` (the default value for the optional argument) or any other
positive value at most the number of dimensions of the input.
Unfortunately, the upper bound is not checked and this results in
reading past the end of the array containing the dimensions of the
input tensor. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The
implementation of shape inference for `ReverseSequence` does not fully
validate the value of `batch_dim` and can result in a heap OOB read.
There is a check to make sure the value of `batch_dim` does not go
over the rank of the input, but there is no check for negative values.
Negative dimensions are allowed in some cases to mimic Python's
negative indexing (i.e., indexing from the end of the array), however
if the value is too negative then the implementation of `Dim` would
access elements before the start of an array. The fix will be included
in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The
implementation of shape inference for `ConcatV2` can be used to
trigger a denial of service attack via a segfault caused by a type
confusion. The `axis` argument is translated into `concat_dim` in the
`ConcatShapeHelper` helper function. Then, a value for `min_rank` is
computed based on `concat_dim`. This is then used to validate that the
`values` tensor has at least the required rank. However,
`WithRankAtLeast` receives the lower bound as a 64-bits value and then
compares it against the maximum 32-bits integer value that could be
represented. Due to the fact that `min_rank` is a 32-bits value and
the value of `axis`, the `rank` argument is a negative value, so the
error check is bypassed. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow
2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as these are also affected and still in
supported range.

A regression exists in the Linux Kernel within KVM: nVMX that allowed
for speculative execution attacks. L2 can carry out Spectre v2 attacks
on L1 due to L1 thinking it doesn't need retpolines or IBPB after
running L2 due to KVM (L0) advertising eIBRS support to L1. An
attacker at L2 with code execution can execute code on an indirect
branch on the host machine. We recommend upgrading to Kernel 6.2 or

Reference: URL:https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/vulnerability-database/CVE-2022-22114

In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Reflected
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The &#8220;search term" search functionality is
not sufficiently sanitized while displaying the results of the search,
which can be leveraged to inject arbitrary scripts. These scripts are
executed in a victim&#8217;s browser when they enter the crafted URL. In the
worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a
highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the
Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the
administrator, by an unauthenticated attacker.

In Teedy, versions v1.5 through v1.9 are vulnerable to Stored Cross-
Site Scripting (XSS) in the name of a created Tag. Since the Tag name
is not being sanitized properly in the edit tag page, a low privileged
attacker can store malicious scripts in the name of the Tag. In the
worst case, the victim who inadvertently triggers the attack is a
highly privileged administrator. The injected scripts can extract the
Session ID, which can lead to full Account Takeover of the
administrator, and privileges escalation.

In a Junos Fusion scenario an External Control of Critical State Data
vulnerability in the Satellite Device (SD) control state machine of
Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker who is able to make
physical changes to the cabling of the device to cause a denial of
service (DoS). An SD can get rebooted and subsequently controlled by
an Aggregation Device (AD) which does not belong to the original
Fusion setup and is just connected to an extended port of the SD. To
carry out this attack the attacker needs to have physical access to
the cabling between the SD and the original AD. This issue affects:
Juniper Networks Junos OS 16.1R1 and later versions prior to
18.4R3-S10; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S7; 19.2 versions prior to

An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in the handling of
IPv6 neighbor state change events in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows
an adjacent attacker to cause a memory leak in the Flexible PIC
Concentrator (FPC) of an ACX5448 router. The continuous flapping of an
IPv6 neighbor with specific timing will cause the FPC to run out of
resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Once the
condition occurs, further packet processing will be impacted, creating
a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition, requiring a manual PFE
restart to restore service. The following error messages will be seen
after the FPC resources have been exhausted: fpc0

A traffic classification vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on
the SRX Series Services Gateways may allow an attacker to bypass
Juniper Deep Packet Inspection (JDPI) rules and access unauthorized
networks or resources, when 'no-syn-check' is enabled on the device.
JDPI incorrectly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the
dynamic-application INCONCLUSIVE instead of UNKNOWN, which is more
permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that
should have been denied. This issue only occurs when 'set security
flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device. This issue

A vulnerability in the NETISR network queue functionality of Juniper
Networks Junos OS kernel allows an attacker to cause a Denial of
Service (DoS) by sending crafted genuine packets to a device. During
an attack, the routing protocol daemon (rpd) CPU may reach 100%
utilization, yet FPC CPUs forwarding traffic will operate normally.
This attack occurs when the attackers' packets are sent over an IPv4
unicast routing equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) unilist selection.
Continued receipt and processing of these packets will create a
sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An indicator of
compromise may be to monitor NETISR drops in the network with the
assistance of JTAC. Please contact JTAC for technical support for
further guidance. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 17.3

A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in
the Layer-2 control protocols daemon (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks Junos
OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to
cause a memory leak. Continued exploitation can lead to memory
exhaustion and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS). This issue occurs
when specific LLDP packets are received. The impact of the l2cpd cores
is that if any of the stp protocols (rstp, mstp or vstp) is used then
stp re-converges and traffic loss will occur during that time. Also if
any services depend on LLDP state (like PoE or VoIP device
recognition) then these will also be affected. The memory utilization
of the L2CPd process can be monitored with the following command:

An Improper Access Control vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS
Evolved allows a network-based unauthenticated attacker who is able to
connect to a specific open IPv4 port, which in affected releases
should otherwise be unreachable, to cause the CPU to consume all
resources as more traffic is sent to the port to create a Denial of
Service (DoS) condition. Continued receipt and processing of these
packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved 20.4 versions

An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol
Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows
an unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service
(DoS). If a BGP update message is received over an established BGP
session, and that message contains a specific, optional transitive
attribute, this session will be torn down with an update message
error. This issue cannot propagate beyond an affected system as the
processing error occurs as soon as the update is received. This issue
is exploitable remotely as the respective attribute will propagate
through unaffected systems and intermediate AS (if any). Continuous
receipt of a BGP update containing this attribute will create a
sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Since this issue only
affects 22.3R1, Juniper strongly encourages customers to move to
22.3R1-S1. Juniper SIRT felt that the need to promptly warn customers
about this issue affecting the 22.3R1 versions of Junos OS and Junos

An Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in the Windows
Installer framework used in the Juniper Networks Juniper Identity
Management Service (JIMS) allows an unprivileged user to trigger a
repair operation. Running a repair operation, in turn, will trigger a
number of file operations in the %TEMP% folder of the user triggering
the repair. Some of these operations will be performed from a SYSTEM
context (started via the Windows Installer service), including the
execution of temporary files. An attacker may be able to provide
malicious binaries to the Windows Installer, which will be executed
with high privilege, leading to a local privilege escalation. This

A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in
the Application Quality of Experience (appqoe) subsystem of the PFE of
Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated
network based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). Upon
receiving specific traffic a memory leak will occur. Sustained
processing of such specific traffic will eventually lead to an out of
memory condition that prevents all services from continuing to
function, and requires a manual restart to recover. A device is only
vulnerable when advance(d) policy based routing (APBR) is configured
and AppQoE (sla rule) is not configured for these APBR rules. This
issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: 20.3 versions
prior to 20.3R3-S2; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S2; 21.1 versions
prior to 21.1R3; 21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2-S1, 21.2R3; 21.3

A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in
the kernel of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated
network based attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). On all
Junos platforms, the Kernel Routing Table (KRT) queue can get stuck
due to a memory leak triggered by interface flaps or route churn
leading to RIB and PFEs getting out of sync. The memory leak causes
RTNEXTHOP/route and next-hop memory pressure issue and the KRT queue
will eventually get stuck with the error- 'ENOMEM -- Cannot allocate

A Missing Release of File Descriptor or Handle after Effective
Lifetime vulnerability in plugable authentication module (PAM) of
Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows a locally
authenticated attacker with low privileges to cause a Denial of
Service (DoS). It is possible that after the termination of a gRPC
connection the respective/var/run/<pid>.env file is not getting
deleted which if occurring repeatedly can cause inode exhaustion.
Inode exhaustion can present itself in two different ways: 1. The
following log message can be observed: host kernel: pid <pid>
(<process>), uid <uid> inumber <number> on /.mount/var: out of inodes
which by itself is a clear indication. 2. The following log message
can be observed: host <process>[<pid>]: ... : No space left on device
which is not deterministic and just a representation of a write error
which could have several reasons. So the following check needs to be
done: user@host> show system storage no-forwarding Filesystem Size
Used Avail Capacity Mounted on /dev/ada1p1 475M 300M 137M 69%
/.mount/var which indicates that the write error is not actually due
to a lack of disk space. If either 1. or 2. has been confirmed, then
the output of: user@host> file list /var/run/*.env | count need to be
checked and if it indicates a high (>10000) number of files the system
has been affected by this issue. This issue affects: Juniper Networks

A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in
Routing Protocol Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS, Junos OS
Evolved allows a network-based unauthenticated attacker to cause a
Denial of Service (DoS). When a BGP flow route with redirect IP
extended community is received, and the reachability to the next-hop
of the corresponding redirect IP is flapping, the rpd process might
crash. Whether the crash occurs depends on the timing of the
internally processing of these two events and is outside the attackers
control. Please note that this issue also affects Route-Reflectors
unless 'routing-options flow firewall-install-disable' is configured.

On QFX10000 Series devices using Juniper Networks Junos OS when
configured as transit IP/MPLS penultimate hop popping (PHP) nodes with
link aggregation group (LAG) interfaces, an Improper Validation of
Specified Index, Position, or Offset in Input weakness allows an
attacker sending certain IP packets to cause multiple interfaces in
the LAG to detach causing a Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
Continued receipt and processing of these packets will sustain the
Denial of Service. This issue affects IPv4 and IPv6 packets. Packets
of either type can cause and sustain the DoS event. These packets can
be destined to the device or be transit packets. On devices such as
the QFX10008 with line cards, line cards can be restarted to restore
service. On devices such as the QFX10002 you can restart the PFE
service, or reboot device to restore service. This issue affects:

An OpenPGP digital signature includes information about the date when
the signature was created. When displaying an email that contains a
digital signature, the email's date will be shown. If the dates were
different, then Thunderbird didn't report the email as having an
invalid signature. If an attacker performed a replay attack, in which
an old email with old contents are resent at a later time, it could
lead the victim to believe that the statements in the email are
current. Fixed versions of Thunderbird will require that the
signature's date roughly matches the displayed date of the email. This
vulnerability affects Thunderbird < 102 and Thunderbird < 91.11.

Within the Umbraco CMS, a configuration element named
"UmbracoApplicationUrl" (or just "ApplicationUrl") is used whenever
application code needs to build a URL pointing back to the site. For
example, when a user resets their password and the application builds
a password reset URL or when the administrator invites users to the
site. For Umbraco versions less than 9.2.0, if the Application URL is
not specifically configured, the attacker can manipulate this value
and store it persistently affecting all users for components where the
"UmbracoApplicationUrl" is used. For example, the attacker is able to
change the URL users receive when resetting their password so that it
points to the attackers server, when the user follows this link the
reset token can be intercepted by the attacker resulting in account
takeover.

The password reset component deployed within Umbraco uses the hostname
supplied within the request host header when building a password reset
URL. It may be possible to manipulate the URL sent to Umbraco users
when so that it points to the attackers server thereby disclosing the
password reset token if/when the link is followed. A related
vulnerability (CVE-2022-22690) could allow this flaw to become
persistent so that all password reset URLs are affected persistently
following a successful attack. See the AppCheck advisory for further
information and associated caveats.

The OpenSSL 3.0.4 release introduced a serious bug in the RSA
implementation for X86_64 CPUs supporting the AVX512IFMA instructions.
This issue makes the RSA implementation with 2048 bit private keys
incorrect on such machines and memory corruption will happen during
the computation. As a consequence of the memory corruption an attacker
may be able to trigger a remote code execution on the machine
performing the computation. SSL/TLS servers or other servers using
2048 bit RSA private keys running on machines supporting AVX512IFMA
instructions of the X86_64 architecture are affected by this issue.
