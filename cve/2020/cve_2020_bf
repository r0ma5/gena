There are issues with the AGE drivers for Golang and Python that
enable SQL injections to occur. This impacts AGE for PostgreSQL 11 &
AGE for PostgreSQL 12, all versions up-to-and-including 1.1.0, when
using those drivers. The fix is to update to the latest Golang and
Python drivers in addition to the latest version of AGE that is used
for PostgreSQL 11 or PostgreSQL 12. The update of AGE will add a new
function to enable parameterization of the cypher() function, which,
in conjunction with the driver updates, will resolve this issue.
Background (for those who want more information): After thoroughly
researching this issue, we found that due to the nature of the
cypher() function, it was not easy to parameterize the values passed
into it. This enabled SQL injections, if the developer of the driver
wasn't careful. The developer of the Golang and Pyton drivers didn't
fully utilize parameterization, likely because of this, thus enabling
SQL injections. The obvious fix to this issue is to use
parameterization in the drivers for all PG SQL queries. However,
parameterizing all PG queries is complicated by the fact that the
cypher() function call itself cannot be parameterized directly, as it
isn't a real function. At least, not the parameters that would take
the graph name and cypher query. The reason the cypher() function
cannot have those values parameterized is because the function is a
placeholder and never actually runs. The cypher() function node,
created by PG in the query tree, is transformed and replaced with a
query tree for the actual cypher query during the analyze phase. The
problem is that parameters - that would be passed in and that the
cypher() function transform needs to be resolved - are only resolved
in the execution phase, which is much later. Since the transform of
the cypher() function needs to know the graph name and cypher query
prior to execution, they can't be passed as parameters. The fix that
we are testing right now, and are proposing to use, is to create a
function that will be called prior to the execution of the cypher()
function transform. This new function will allow values to be passed
as parameters for the graph name and cypher query. As this command
will be executed prior to the cypher() function transform, its values
will be resolved. These values can then be cached for the immediately
following cypher() function transform to use. As added features, the
cached values will store the calling session's pid, for validation.
And, the cypher() function transform will clear this cached
information after function invocation, regardless of whether it was
used. This method will allow the parameterizing of the cypher()
function indirectly and provide a way to lock out SQL injection
attacks.

LDAP Injection is an attack used to exploit web based applications
that construct LDAP statements based on user input. When an
application fails to properly sanitize user input, it's possible to
modify LDAP statements through techniques similar to SQL Injection.
LDAP injection attacks could result in the granting of permissions to
unauthorized queries, and content modification inside the LDAP tree.
This risk may only occur when the user logs in with ldap, and the user
name and password login will not be affected, Users of the affected
versions should upgrade to Apache StreamPark 2.0.0 or later.

A remote OScript execution issue was discovered in OpenText Content
Suite Platform 22.1 (16.2.19.1803). Multiple endpoints allow the user
to pass the parameter htmlFile, which is included in the HTML output
rendering pipeline of a request. Because the Content Server evaluates
and executes Oscript code in HTML files, it is possible for an
attacker to execute Oscript code. The Oscript scripting language
allows the attacker (for example) to manipulate files on the
filesystem, create new network connections, or execute OS commands.

authentik is an open-source identity provider. Versions prior to
2022.11.2 and 2022.10.2 are vulnerable to unauthorized user creation
and potential account takeover. With the default flows,
unauthenticated users can create new accounts in authentik. If a flow
exists that allows for email-verified password recovery, this can be
used to overwrite the email address of admin accounts and take over
their accounts. authentik 2022.11.2 and 2022.10.2 fix this issue. As a
workaround, a policy can be created and bound to the `default-user-
settings-flow flow` with the contents `return
request.user.is_authenticated`.

Prometheus Exporter Toolkit is a utility package to build exporters.
Prior to versions 0.7.2 and 0.8.2, if someone has access to a
Prometheus web.yml file and users' bcrypted passwords, they can bypass
security by poisoning the built-in authentication cache. Versions
0.7.2 and 0.8.2 contain a fix for the issue. There is no workaround,
but attacker must have access to the hashed password to use this
functionality.

Cap'n Proto is a data interchange format and remote procedure call
(RPC) system. Cap'n Proro prior to versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2, and
0.10.3, as well as versions of Cap'n Proto's Rust implementation prior
to 0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2 are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read
due to logic error handling list-of-list. This issue may lead someone
to remotely segfault a peer by sending it a malicious message, if the
victim performs certain actions on a list-of-pointer type.
Exfiltration of memory is possible if the victim performs additional
certain actions on a list-of-pointer type. To be vulnerable, an
application must perform a specific sequence of actions, described in
the GitHub Security Advisory. The bug is present in inlined code,
therefore the fix will require rebuilding dependent applications.
Cap'n Proto has C++ fixes available in versions 0.7.1, 0.8.1, 0.9.2,
and 0.10.3. The `capnp` Rust crate has fixes available in versions
0.13.7, 0.14.11, and 0.15.2.

OP-TEE Trusted OS is the secure side implementation of OP-TEE project,
a Trusted Execution Environment. Versions prior to 3.19.0, contain an
Improper Validation of Array Index vulnerability. The function
`cleanup_shm_refs()` is called by both `entry_invoke_command()` and
`entry_open_session()`. The commands `OPTEE_MSG_CMD_OPEN_SESSION` and
`OPTEE_MSG_CMD_INVOKE_COMMAND` can be executed from the normal world
via an OP-TEE SMC. This function is not validating the `num_params`
argument, which is only limited to `OPTEE_MSG_MAX_NUM_PARAMS` (127) in
the function `get_cmd_buffer()`. Therefore, an attacker in the normal
world can craft an SMC call that will cause out-of-bounds reading in
`cleanup_shm_refs` and potentially freeing of fake-objects in the
function `mobj_put()`. A normal-world attacker with permission to
execute SMC instructions may exploit this flaw. Maintainers believe
this problem permits local privilege escalation from the normal world
to the secure world. Version 3.19.0 contains a fix for this issue.
There are no known workarounds.

Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. In
affected versions there is a potential vulnerability in Traefik
managing TLS connections. A router configured with a not well-
formatted TLSOption is exposed with an empty TLSOption. For instance,
a route secured using an mTLS connection set with a wrong CA file is
exposed without verifying the client certificates. Users are advised
to upgrade to version 2.9.6. Users unable to upgrade should check
their logs to detect the error messages and fix your TLS options.

Airtable.js is the JavaScript client for Airtable. Prior to version
0.11.6, Airtable.js had a misconfigured build script in its source
package. When the build script is run, it would bundle environment
variables into the build target of a transpiled bundle. Specifically,
the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_ENDPOINT_URL environment variables
are inserted during Browserify builds due to being referenced in
Airtable.js code. This only affects copies of Airtable.js built from
its source, not those installed via npm or yarn. Airtable API keys set
in users&#8217; environments via the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable
may be bundled into local copies of Airtable.js source code if all of
the following conditions are met: 1) the user has cloned the
Airtable.js source onto their machine, 2) the user runs the `npm
prepare` script, and 3) the user' has the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment
variable set. If these conditions are met, a user&#8217;s local build of
Airtable.js would be modified to include the value of the
AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable, which could then be
accidentally shipped in the bundled code. Users who do not meet all
three of these conditions are not impacted by this issue. Users should
upgrade to Airtable.js version 0.11.6 or higher; or, as a workaround
unset the AIRTABLE_API_KEY environment variable in their shell and/or
remove it from your .bashrc, .zshrc, or other shell configuration
files. Users should also regenerate any Airtable API keys they use, as
the keysy may be present in bundled code.

The Synthetic Monitoring Agent for Grafana's Synthetic Monitoring
application provides probe functionality and executes network checks
for monitoring remote targets. Users running the Synthetic Monitoring
agent prior to version 0.12.0 in their local network are impacted. The
authentication token used to communicate with the Synthetic Monitoring
API is exposed through a debugging endpoint. This token can be used to
retrieve the Synthetic Monitoring checks created by the user and
assigned to the agent identified with that token. The Synthetic
Monitoring API will reject connections from already-connected agents,
so access to the token does not guarantee access to the checks.
Version 0.12.0 contains a fix. Users are advised to rotate the agent
tokens. After upgrading to version v0.12.0 or later, it's recommended
that users of distribution packages review the configuration stored in
`/etc/synthetic-monitoring/synthetic-monitoring-agent.conf`,
specifically the `API_TOKEN` variable which has been renamed to
`SM_AGENT_API_TOKEN`. As a workaround for previous versions, it's
recommended that users review the agent settings and set the HTTP
listening address in a manner that limits the exposure, for example,
localhost or a non-routed network, by using the command line parameter
`-listen-address`, e.g. `-listen-address localhost:4050`.

Travel support program is a rails app to support the travel support
program of openSUSE (TSP). Sensitive user data (bank account details,
password Hash) can be extracted via Ransack query injection. Every
deployment of travel-support-program below the patched version is
affected. The travel-support-program uses the Ransack library to
implement search functionality. In its default configuration, Ransack
will allow for query conditions based on properties of associated
database objects [1]. The `*_start`, `*_end` or `*_cont` search
matchers [2] can then be abused to exfiltrate sensitive string values
of associated database objects via character-by-character brute-force
(A match is indicated by the returned JSON not being empty). A single
bank account number can be extracted with <200 requests, a password
hash can be extracted with ~1200 requests, all within a few minutes.
The problem has been patched in commit

Syncthing is an open source, continuous file synchronization program.
In versions prior to 1.23.5 a compromised instance with shared folders
could sync malicious files which contain arbitrary HTML and JavaScript
in the name. If the owner of another device looks over the shared
folder settings and moves the mouse over the latest sync, a script
could be executed to change settings for shared folders or add devices
automatically. Additionally adding a new device with a malicious name
could embed HTML or JavaScript inside parts of the page. As a result
the webUI may be subject to a stored cross site scripting attack. This
issue has been addressed in version 1.23.5. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid sharing folders with

Capsule is a multi-tenancy and policy-based framework for Kubernetes.
Prior to version 0.1.3, a ServiceAccount deployed in a Tenant
Namespace, when granted with `PATCH` capabilities on its own
Namespace, is able to edit it and remove the Owner Reference, breaking
the reconciliation of the Capsule Operator and removing all the
enforcement like Pod Security annotations, Network Policies, Limit
Range and Resource Quota items. An attacker could detach the Namespace
from a Tenant that is forbidding starting privileged Pods using the
Pod Security labels by removing the OwnerReference, removing the
enforcement labels, and being able to start privileged containers that
would be able to start a generic Kubernetes privilege escalation.
Patches have been released for version 0.1.3. No known workarounds are
available.

Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version
2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 2.9.0.beta15 on the `beta`
and `tests-passed` branches, recipients of a group SMTP email could
see the email addresses of all other users inside the group SMTP
topic. Most of the time this is not an issue as they are likely
already familiar with one another's email addresses. This issue is
patched in versions 2.8.14 and 2.9.0.beta15. The fix is that someone
sending emails out via group SMTP to non-staged users masks those
emails with blind carbon copy (BCC). Staged users are ones that have
likely only interacted with the group via email, and will likely
include other people who were CC'd on the original email to the group.
As a workaround, disable group SMTP for any groups that have it
enabled.

Cacti is an open source platform which provides a robust and
extensible operational monitoring and fault management framework for
users. In affected versions a command injection vulnerability allows
an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running
Cacti, if a specific data source was selected for any monitored
device. The vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This
file can be accessed without authentication. This function retrieves
the IP address of the client via `get_client_addr` and resolves this
IP address to the corresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After
this, it is verified that an entry within the `poller` table exists,
where the hostname corresponds to the resolved hostname. If such an
entry was found, the function returns `true` and the client is
authorized. This authorization can be bypassed due to the
implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function is
defined in the file `lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER`
variables to determine the IP address of the client. The variables
beginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker. Since
there is a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of
the server running Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication
e.g. by providing the header `Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the
function `get_client_addr` returns the IP address of the server
running Cacti. The following call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve this
IP address to the hostname of the server, which will pass the `poller`
hostname check because of the default entry. After the authorization
of the `remote_agent.php` file is bypassed, an attacker can trigger
different actions. One of these actions is called `polldata`. The
called function `poll_for_data` retrieves a few request parameters and
loads the corresponding `poller_item` entries from the database. If
the `action` of a `poller_item` equals `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the
function `proc_open` is used to execute a PHP script. The attacker-
controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved via the function
`get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings. This
variable is later inserted into the string passed to `proc_open`,
which leads to a command injection vulnerability. By e.g. providing
the `poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In order to reach
the vulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and
`local_data_id`, where the `action` of the corresponding `poller_item`
is set to `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of these ids (`host_id` and
`local_data_id`) can easily be bruteforced. The only requirement is
that a `poller_item` with an `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists.
This is very likely on a productive instance because this action is
added by some predefined templates like `Device - Uptime` or `Device -
Polling Time`. This command injection vulnerability allows an
unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item`
with the `action` type `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured.
The authorization bypass should be prevented by not allowing an
attacker to make `get_client_addr` (file `lib/functions.php`) return
an arbitrary IP address. This could be done by not honoring the
`HTTP_...` `$_SERVER` variables. If these should be kept for
compatibility reasons it should at least be prevented to fake the IP
address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has been
addressed in both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23`
being the first release containing the patch.

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. When an application
uses (1) multiple session cookies (e.g., one for user pages and one
for admin pages) and (2) a session handler is set to
`DatabaseHandler`, `MemcachedHandler`, or `RedisHandler`, then if an
attacker gets one session cookie (e.g., one for user pages), they may
be able to access pages that require another session cookie (e.g., for
admin pages). This issue has been patched, please upgrade to version
4.2.11 or later. As a workaround, use only one session cookie.

authentik is an open-source Identity provider focused on flexibility
and versatility. In versions prior to 2022.10.4, and 2022.11.4, any
authenticated user can create an arbitrary number of accounts through
the default flows. This would circumvent any policy in a situation
where it is undesirable for users to create new accounts by
themselves. This may also affect other applications as these new basic
accounts would exist throughout the SSO infrastructure. By default the
newly created accounts cannot be logged into as no password reset
exists by default. However password resets are likely to be enabled by
most installations. This vulnerability pertains to the user context
used in the default-user-settings-flow,
/api/v3/flows/instances/default-user-settings-flow/execute/. This
issue has been fixed in versions 2022.10.4 and 2022.11.4.

Elrond-GO is a go implementation for the Elrond Network protocol.
Versions prior to 1.3.50 are subject to a processing issue where nodes
are affected when trying to process a cross-shard relayed transaction
with a smart contract deploy transaction data. The problem was a bad
correlation between the transaction caches and the processing
component. If the above-mentioned transaction was sent with more gas
than required, the smart contract result (SCR transaction) that should
have returned the leftover gas, would have been wrongly added to a
cache that the processing unit did not consider. The node stopped
notarizing metachain blocks. The fix was actually to extend the SCR
transaction search in all other caches if it wasn't found in the
correct (expected) sharded-cache. There are no known workarounds at
this time. This issue has been patched in version 1.3.50.

efs-utils is a set of Utilities for Amazon Elastic File System (EFS).
A potential race condition issue exists within the Amazon EFS mount
helper in efs-utils versions v1.34.3 and below. When using TLS to
mount file systems, the mount helper allocates a local port for
stunnel to receive NFS connections prior to applying the TLS tunnel.
In affected versions, concurrent mount operations can allocate the
same local port, leading to either failed mount operations or an
inappropriate mapping from an EFS customer&#8217;s local mount points to
that customer&#8217;s EFS file systems. This issue is patched in version
v1.34.4. There is no recommended work around. We recommend affected
users update the installed version of efs-utils to v1.34.4 or later.

JSON5 is an extension to the popular JSON file format that aims to be
easier to write and maintain by hand (e.g. for config files). The
`parse` method of the JSON5 library before and including versions
1.0.1 and 2.2.1 does not restrict parsing of keys named `__proto__`,
allowing specially crafted strings to pollute the prototype of the
resulting object. This vulnerability pollutes the prototype of the
object returned by `JSON5.parse` and not the global Object prototype,
which is the commonly understood definition of Prototype Pollution.
However, polluting the prototype of a single object can have
significant security impact for an application if the object is later
used in trusted operations. This vulnerability could allow an attacker
to set arbitrary and unexpected keys on the object returned from
`JSON5.parse`. The actual impact will depend on how applications
utilize the returned object and how they filter unwanted keys, but
could include denial of service, cross-site scripting, elevation of
privilege, and in extreme cases, remote code execution. `JSON5.parse`
should restrict parsing of `__proto__` keys when parsing JSON strings
to objects. As a point of reference, the `JSON.parse` method included
in JavaScript ignores `__proto__` keys. Simply changing `JSON5.parse`
to `JSON.parse` in the examples above mitigates this vulnerability.
This vulnerability is patched in json5 versions 1.0.2, 2.2.2, and
later.

Cargo is a Rust package manager. The Rust Security Response WG was
notified that Cargo did not perform SSH host key verification when
cloning indexes and dependencies via SSH. An attacker could exploit
this to perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This vulnerability
has been assigned CVE-2022-46176. All Rust versions containing Cargo
before 1.66.1 are vulnerable. Note that even if you don't explicitly
use SSH for alternate registry indexes or crate dependencies, you
might be affected by this vulnerability if you have configured git to
replace HTTPS connections to GitHub with SSH (through git's
[`url.<base>.insteadOf`][1] setting), as that'd cause you to clone the
crates.io index through SSH. Rust 1.66.1 will ensure Cargo checks the
SSH host key and abort the connection if the server's public key is
not already trusted. We recommend everyone to upgrade as soon as
possible.

Discourse is an option source discussion platform. Prior to version
2.8.14 on the `stable` branch and version 3.0.0.beta16 on the `beta`

still valid. When the old reset email is used to reset the password,
the Discourse account's primary email would be re-linked to the old
email. If the old email address is compromised or has transferred
ownership, this leads to an account takeover. This is however
mitigated by the SiteSetting `email_token_valid_hours` which is

Gotify server is a simple server for sending and receiving messages in
real-time per WebSocket. Versions prior to 2.2.2 contain an XSS
vulnerability that allows authenticated users to upload .html files.
An attacker could execute client side scripts **if** another user
opened a link. The attacker could potentially take over the account of
the user that clicked the link. The Gotify UI won't natively expose
such a malicious link, so an attacker has to get the user to open the
malicious link in a context outside of Gotify. The vulnerability has
been fixed in version 2.2.2. As a workaround, you can block access to
non image files via a reverse proxy in the `./image` directory.

versions up to, and including, 1.4 due to insufficient input
sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers, with administrator-level permissions and
above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute
whenever a user accesses an injected page. This only affects multi-
site installations and installations where unfiltered_html has been
disabled.

A cleverly devised username might bypass LDAP authentication checks.
In LDAP-authenticated Derby installations, this could let an attacker
fill up the disk by creating junk Derby databases. In LDAP-
authenticated Derby installations, this could also allow the attacker
to execute malware which was visible to and executable by the account
which booted the Derby server. In LDAP-protected databases which
weren't also protected by SQL GRANT/REVOKE authorization, this
vulnerability could also let an attacker view and corrupt sensitive
data and run sensitive database functions and procedures. Mitigation:
Users should upgrade to Java 21 and Derby 10.17.1.0. Alternatively,
users who wish to remain on older Java versions should build their own
Derby distribution from one of the release families to which the fix
was backported: 10.16, 10.15, and 10.14. Those are the releases which
correspond, respectively, with Java LTS versions 17, 11, and 8.

Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference, XML Injection
(aka Blind XPath Injection) vulnerability in Apache Software
Foundation Apache Ivy.This issue affects any version of Apache Ivy
prior to 2.5.2. When Apache Ivy prior to 2.5.2 parses XML files -
either its own configuration, Ivy files or Apache Maven POMs - it will
allow downloading external document type definitions and expand any
entity references contained therein when used. This can be used to
exfiltrate data, access resources only the machine running Ivy has
access to or disturb the execution of Ivy in different ways. Starting
with Ivy 2.5.2 DTD processing is disabled by default except when
parsing Maven POMs where the default is to allow DTD processing but
only to include a DTD snippet shipping with Ivy that is needed to deal
with existing Maven POMs that are not valid XML files but are
nevertheless accepted by Maven. Access can be be made more lenient via
newly introduced system properties where needed. Users of Ivy prior to
version 2.5.2 can use Java system properties to restrict processing of
external DTDs, see the section about "JAXP Properties for External
Access restrictions" inside Oracle's "Java API for XML Processing
(JAXP) Security Guide".

There exists a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel
through io_uring and the IORING_OP_SPLICE operation. If
IORING_OP_SPLICE is missing the IO_WQ_WORK_FILES flag, which signals
that the operation won't use current->nsproxy, so its reference
counter is not increased. This assumption is not always true as
calling io_splice on specific files will call the get_uts function
which will use current->nsproxy leading to invalidly decreasing its
reference counter later causing the use-after-free vulnerability. We
recommend upgrading to version 5.10.160 or above

Password recovery vulnerability in SICK SIM2000ST Partnumber 2086502
with firmware version <1.13.4 allows an unprivileged remote attacker
to gain access to the userlevel defined as RecoverableUserLevel by
invocating the password recovery mechanism method. This leads to an
increase in their privileges on the system and thereby affecting the
confidentiality integrity and availability of the system. An attacker

The IEEE 802.11 specifications through 802.11ax allow physically
proximate attackers to intercept (possibly cleartext) target-destined
frames by spoofing a target's MAC address, sending Power Save frames
to the access point, and then sending other frames to the access point
(such as authentication frames or re-association frames) to remove the
target's original security context. This behavior occurs because the
specifications do not require an access point to purge its transmit
queue before removing a client's pairwise encryption key.

Razer Synapse through 3.7.1209.121307 allows privilege escalation due
to an unsafe installation path and improper privilege management.
Attackers can place DLLs into %PROGRAMDATA%\Razer\Synapse3\Service\bin
if they do so before the service is installed and if they deny write
access for the SYSTEM user. Although the service will not start if it
detects malicious DLLs in this directory, attackers can exploit a race
condition and replace a valid DLL (i.e., a copy of a legitimate Razer
DLL) with a malicious DLL after the service has already checked the
file. As a result, local Windows users can abuse the Razer driver
installer to obtain administrative privileges on Windows.

In the Linux kernel before 6.1.6, a NULL pointer dereference bug in
the traffic control subsystem allows an unprivileged user to trigger a
denial of service (system crash) via a crafted traffic control
configuration that is set up with "tc qdisc" and "tc class" commands.
This affects qdisc_graft in net/sched/sch_api.c.

An issue was discovered in IO FinNet tss-lib before 2.0.0. The
parameter ssid for defining a session id is not used through the MPC
implementation, which makes replaying and spoofing of messages easier.
In particular, the Schnorr proof of knowledge implemented in sch.go
does not utilize a session id, context, or random nonce in the
generation of the challenge. This could allow a malicious user or an
eavesdropper to replay a valid proof sent in the past.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00025.html

lxc-user-nic in lxc through 5.0.1 is installed setuid root, and may
allow local users to infer whether any file exists, even within a
protected directory tree, because "Failed to open" often indicates
that a file does not exist, whereas "does not refer to a network
namespace path" often indicates that a file exists. NOTE: this is
different from CVE-2018-6556 because the CVE-2018-6556 fix design was
based on the premise that "we will report back to the user that the
open() failed but the user has no way of knowing why it failed";
however, in many realistic cases, there are no plausible reasons for
failing except that the file does not exist.

SoftPerfect NetWorx 7.1.1 on Windows allows an attacker to execute a
malicious binary with potentially higher privileges via a low-
privileged user account that abuses the Notifications function. The
Notifications function allows for arbitrary binary execution and can
be modified by any user. The resulting binary execution will occur in
the context of any user running NetWorx. If an attacker modifies the
Notifications function to execute a malicious binary, the binary will
be executed by every user running NetWorx on that system.

GNU Emacs through 28.2 allows attackers to execute commands via shell
metacharacters in the name of a source-code file, because lib-
src/etags.c uses the system C library function in its implementation
of the etags program. For example, a victim may use the "etags -u *"
command (suggested in the etags documentation) in a situation where
the current working directory has contents that depend on untrusted
input.

An issue was discovered in GNU Emacs through 28.2. In ruby-mode.el,
the ruby-find-library-file function has a local command injection
vulnerability. The ruby-find-library-file function is an interactive
function, and bound to C-c C-f. Inside the function, the external
command gem is called through shell-command-to-string, but the
feature-name parameters are not escaped. Thus, malicious Ruby source
files may cause commands to be executed.
