Tuta is an encrypted email service. In versions prior to 119.10, an
attacker can attach an image in a html mail which is loaded from
external resource in the default setting, which should prevent loading
of external resources. When displaying emails containing external
content, they should be loaded by default only after confirmation by
the user. However, it could be recognized that certain embedded images
(see PoC) are loaded, even though the "Automatic Reloading of Images"
function is disabled by default. The reloading is also done
unencrypted via HTTP and redirections are followed. This behavior is
unexpected for the user, since the user assumes that external content
will only be loaded after explicit manual confirmation. The loading of
external content in e-mails represents a risk, because this makes the
sender aware that the e-mail address is used, when the e-mail was
read, which device is used and expose the user's IP address. Version
119.10 contains a patch for this issue.

Vite is a frontend tooling framework for javascript. The Vite dev
server option `server.fs.deny` can be bypassed on case-insensitive
file systems using case-augmented versions of filenames. Notably this
affects servers hosted on Windows. This bypass is similar to
CVE-2023-34092 -- with surface area reduced to hosts having case-
insensitive filesystems. Since `picomatch` defaults to case-sensitive
glob matching, but the file server doesn't discriminate; a blacklist
bypass is possible. By requesting raw filesystem paths using augmented
casing, the matcher derived from `config.server.fs.deny` fails to
block access to sensitive files. This issue has been addressed in
vite@5.0.12, vite@4.5.2, vite@3.2.8, and vite@2.9.17. Users are
advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to
dev servers.

The Notary Project is a set of specifications and tools intended to
provide a cross-industry standard for securing software supply chains
by using authentic container images and other OCI artifacts. An
external actor with control of a compromised container registry can
provide outdated versions of OCI artifacts, such as Images. This could
lead artifact consumers with relaxed trust policies (such as
`permissive` instead of `strict`) to potentially use artifacts with
signatures that are no longer valid, making them susceptible to any
exploits those artifacts may contain. In Notary Project, an artifact
publisher can control the validity period of artifact by specifying
signature expiry during the signing process. Using shorter signature
validity periods along with processes to periodically resign
artifacts, allows artifact producers to ensure that their consumers
will only receive up-to-date artifacts. Artifact consumers should
correspondingly use a `strict` or equivalent trust policy that
enforces signature expiry. Together these steps enable use of up-to-
date artifacts and safeguard against rollback attack in the event of
registry compromise. The Notary Project offers various signature
validation options such as `permissive`, `audit` and `skip` to support
various scenarios. These scenarios includes 1) situations demanding
urgent workload deployment, necessitating the bypassing of expired or
revoked signatures; 2) auditing of artifacts lacking signatures
without interrupting workload; and 3) skipping of verification for
specific images that might have undergone validation through
alternative mechanisms. Additionally, the Notary Project supports
revocation to ensure the signature freshness. Artifact publishers can
sign with short-lived certificates and revoke older certificates when
necessary. This revocation serves as a signal to inform artifact
consumers that the corresponding unexpired artifact is no longer
approved by the publisher. This enables the artifact publisher to
control the validity of the signature independently of their ability
to manage artifacts in a compromised registry.

LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is a webfrontend for managing entries
stored in an LDAP directory. LAM's log configuration allows to specify
arbitrary paths for log files. Prior to version 8.7, an attacker could
exploit this by creating a PHP file and cause LAM to log some PHP code
to this file. When the file is then accessed via web the code would be
executed. The issue is mitigated by the following: An attacker needs
to know LAM's master configuration password to be able to change the
main settings; and the webserver needs write access to a directory
that is accessible via web. LAM itself does not provide any such
directories. The issue has been fixed in 8.7. As a workaround, limit
access to LAM configuration pages to authorized users.

aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio
and Python. When using aiohttp as a web server and configuring static
routes, it is necessary to specify the root path for static files.
Additionally, the option 'follow_symlinks' can be used to determine
whether to follow symbolic links outside the static root directory.
When 'follow_symlinks' is set to True, there is no validation to check
if reading a file is within the root directory. This can lead to
directory traversal vulnerabilities, resulting in unauthorized access
to arbitrary files on the system, even when symlinks are not present.
Disabling follow_symlinks and using a reverse proxy are encouraged
mitigations. Version 3.9.2 fixes this issue.

@hono/node-server is an adapter that allows users to run Hono
applications on Node.js. Since v1.3.0, @hono/node-server has used its
own Request object with `url` behavior that is unexpected. In the
standard API, if the URL contains `..`, here called "double dots", the
URL string returned by Request will be in the resolved path. However,
the `url` in @hono/node-server's Request as does not resolve double
dots, so `http://localhost/static/.. /foo.txt` is returned. This
causes vulnerabilities when using `serveStatic`. Modern web browsers
and a latest `curl` command resolve double dots on the client side, so
this issue doesn't affect those using either of those tools. However,
problems may occur if accessed by a client that does not resolve them.
Version 1.4.1 includes the change to fix this issue. As a workaround,
don't use `serveStatic`.

PostgreSQL Anonymizer v1.2 contains a SQL injection vulnerability that
allows a user who owns a table to elevate to superuser when dynamic
masking is enabled. PostgreSQL Anonymizer enables users to set
security labels on tables to mask specified columns. There is a flaw
that allows complex expressions to be provided as a value. This
expression is then later used as it to create the masked views leading
to SQL Injection. If dynamic masking is enabled, this will lead to
privilege escalation to superuser after the label is created. Users
that don't own a table, especially masked users cannot exploit this
vulnerability. The problem is resolved in v1.3.

PostgreSQL Anonymizer v1.2 contains a vulnerability that allows a user
who owns a table to elevate to superuser. A user can define a masking
function for a column and place malicious code in that function. When
a privileged user applies the masking rules using the static masking
or the anonymous dump method, the malicious code is executed and can
grant escalated privileges to the malicious user. PostgreSQL
Anonymizer v1.2 does provide a protection against this risk with the
restrict_to_trusted_schemas option, but that protection is incomplete.
Users that don't own a table, especially masked users cannot exploit
this vulnerability. The problem is resolved in v1.3.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/08/1

Request smuggling vulnerability in HTTP server in Apache bRPC
0.9.5~1.7.0 on all platforms allows attacker to smuggle request.
Vulnerability Cause Description&#65306; The http_parser does not comply with
the RFC-7230 HTTP 1.1 specification. Attack scenario: If a message is
received with both a Transfer-Encoding and a Content-Length header
field, such a message might indicate an attempt to perform request
smuggling or response splitting. One particular attack scenario is
that a bRPC made http server on the backend receiving requests in one
persistent connection from frontend server that uses TE to parse
request with the logic that 'chunk' is contained in the TE field. in
that case an attacker can smuggle a request into the connection to the
backend server. Solution: You can choose one solution from below: 1.
Upgrade bRPC to version 1.8.0, which fixes this issue. Download link:
https://github.com/apache/brpc/releases/tag/1.8.0 2. Apply this patch:

Label Studio, an open source data labeling tool had a remote import
feature allowed users to import data from a remote web source, that
was downloaded and could be viewed on the website. Prior to version
1.10.1, this feature could had been abused to download a HTML file
that executed malicious JavaScript code in the context of the Label
Studio website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an
attacker performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they
visit the crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft
a JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user
if a Django administrator visits the image. `data_import/uploader.py`
lines 125C5 through 146 showed that if a URL passed the server side
request forgery verification checks, the contents of the file would be
downloaded using the filename in the URL. The downloaded file path
could then be retrieved by sending a request to
`/api/projects/{project_id}/file-uploads?ids=[{download_id}]` where
`{project_id}` was the ID of the project and `{download_id}` was the
ID of the downloaded file. Once the downloaded file path was retrieved
by the previous API endpoint, `data_import/api.py`lines 595C1 through
616C62 demonstrated that the `Content-Type` of the response was
determined by the file extension, since `mimetypes.guess_type` guesses
the `Content-Type` based on the file extension. Since the `Content-
Type` was determined by the file extension of the downloaded file, an
attacker could import in a `.html` file that would execute JavaScript
when visited. Version 1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue. Other
remediation strategies are also available. For all user provided files
that are downloaded by Label Studio, set the `Content-Security-Policy:
sandbox;` response header when viewed on the site. The `sandbox`
directive restricts a page's actions to prevent popups, execution of
plugins and scripts and enforces a `same-origin` policy.
Alternatively, restrict the allowed file extensions that may be
downloaded.

GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that
allows users to share and edit geospatial data. An arbitrary file
renaming vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.5 and 2.24.2
that enables an authenticated administrator with permissions to modify
stores through the REST Coverage Store or Data Store API to rename
arbitrary files and directories with a name that does not end in
`.zip`. Store file uploads rename zip files to have a `.zip` extension
if it doesn't already have one before unzipping the file. This is fine
for file and url upload methods where the files will be in a specific
subdirectory of the data directory but, when using the external upload
method, this allows arbitrary files and directories to be renamed.
Renaming GeoServer files will most likely result in a denial of
service, either completely preventing GeoServer from running or
effectively deleting specific resources (such as a workspace, layer or
style). In some cases, renaming GeoServer files could revert to the
default settings for that file which could be relatively harmless like
removing contact information or have more serious consequences like
allowing users to make OGC requests that the customized settings would
have prevented them from making. The impact of renaming non-GeoServer
files depends on the specific environment although some sort of denial
of service is a likely outcome. Versions 2.23.5 and 2.24.2 contain a
fix for this issue.

SOFARPC is a Java RPC framework. SOFARPC defaults to using the SOFA
Hessian protocol to deserialize received data, while the SOFA Hessian
protocol uses a blacklist mechanism to restrict deserialization of
potentially dangerous classes for security protection. But, prior to
version 5.12.0, there is a gadget chain that can bypass the SOFA
Hessian blacklist protection mechanism, and this gadget chain only
relies on JDK and does not rely on any third-party components. Version
5.12.0 fixed this issue by adding a blacklist. SOFARPC also provides a
way to add additional blacklists. Users can add a class like
`-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=org.apache.xpath.` to avoid this
issue.

Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an expired pointer
reference bug, Squid prior to version 6.6 is vulnerable to a Denial of
Service attack against Cache Manager error responses. This problem
allows a trusted client to perform Denial of Service when generating
error pages for Client Manager reports. Squid older than 5.0.5 have
not been tested and should be assumed to be vulnerable. All Squid-5.x
up to and including 5.9 are vulnerable. All Squid-6.x up to and
including 6.5 are vulnerable. This bug is fixed by Squid version 6.6.
In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable releases
can be found in Squid's patch archives. As a workaround, prevent
access to Cache Manager using Squid's main access control:
`http_access deny manager`.

Micronaut Framework is a modern, JVM-based, full stack Java framework
designed for building modular, easily testable JVM applications with
support for Java, Kotlin and the Groovy language. Enabled but
unsecured management endpoints are susceptible to drive-by localhost
attacks. While not typical of a production application, these attacks
may have more impact on a development environment where such endpoints
may be flipped on without much thought. A malicious/compromised
website can make HTTP requests to `localhost`. Normally, such requests
would trigger a CORS preflight check which would prevent the request;
however, some requests are "simple" and do not require a preflight
check. These endpoints, if enabled and not secured, are vulnerable to
being triggered. Production environments typically disable unused
endpoints and secure/restrict access to needed endpoints. A more
likely victim is the developer in their local development host, who
has enabled endpoints without security for the sake of easing
development. This issue has been addressed in version 3.8.3. Users are
advised to upgrade.

SvelteKit is a web development kit. In SvelteKit 2, sending a GET
request with a body eg `{}` to a built and previewed/hosted sveltekit
app throws `Request with GET/HEAD method cannot have body.` and
crashes the preview/hosting. After this happens, one must manually
restart the app. `TRACE` requests will also cause the app to crash.
Prerendered pages and SvelteKit 1 apps are not affected.
`@sveltejs/adapter-node` versions 2.1.2, 3.0.3, and 4.0.1 and
`@sveltejs/kit` version 2.4.3 contain a patch for this issue.

GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that
allows users to share and edit geospatial data. A stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.4 and
2.24.1 that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-
level privileges to store a JavaScript payload in the GeoServer
catalog that will execute in the context of another user's browser
when viewed in the WMS GetMap SVG Output Format when the Simple SVG
renderer is enabled. Access to the WMS SVG Format is available to all
users by default although data and service security may limit users'
ability to trigger the XSS. Versions 2.23.4 and 2.24.1 contain a fix
for this issue.

Trillium is a composable toolkit for building internet applications
with async rust. In `trillium-http` prior to 0.3.12 and `trillium-
client` prior to 0.5.4, insufficient validation of outbound header
values may lead to request splitting or response splitting attacks in
scenarios where attackers have sufficient control over headers. This
only affects use cases where attackers have control of request
headers, and can insert "\r\n" sequences. Specifically, if untrusted
and unvalidated input is inserted into header names or values.
Outbound `trillium_http::HeaderValue` and `trillium_http::HeaderName`
can be constructed infallibly and were not checked for illegal bytes
when sending requests from the client or responses from the server.
Thus, if an attacker has sufficient control over header values (or
names) in a request or response that they could inject `\r\n`
sequences, they could get the client and server out of sync, and then
pivot to gain control over other parts of requests or responses. (i.e.
exfiltrating data from other requests, SSRF, etc.) In `trillium-http`
versions 0.3.12 and later, if a header name is invalid in server
response headers, the specific header and any associated values are
omitted from network transmission. Additionally, if a header value is
invalid in server response headers, the individual header value is
omitted from network transmission. Other headers values with the same
header name will still be sent. In `trillium-client` versions 0.5.4
and later, if any header name or header value is invalid in the client
request headers, awaiting the client Conn returns an
`Error::MalformedHeader` prior to any network access. As a workaround,
Trillium services and client applications should sanitize or validate
untrusted input that is included in header values and header names.
Carriage return, newline, and null characters are not allowed.

Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a backend user interface for
Pimcore. The application allows users to create zip files from
available files on the site. In the 1.x branch prior to version 1.3.2,
parameter `selectedIds` is susceptible to SQL Injection. Any backend
user with very basic permissions can execute arbitrary SQL statements
and thus alter any data or escalate their privileges to at least admin
level. Version 1.3.2 contains a fix for this issue.

Authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. There is a bug in our
implementation of PKCE that allows an attacker to circumvent the
protection that PKCE offers. PKCE adds the code_challenge parameter to
the authorization request and adds the code_verifier parameter to the
token request. Prior to 2023.8.7 and 2023.10.7, a downgrade scenario
is possible: if the attacker removes the code_challenge parameter from
the authorization request, authentik will not do the PKCE check.
Because of this bug, an attacker can circumvent the protection PKCE
offers, such as CSRF attacks and code injection attacks. Versions
2023.8.7 and 2023.10.7 fix the issue.

Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a backend user interface for
Pimcore. The password reset functionality sends to the the user
requesting a password change an email containing an URL to reset its
password. The URL sent contains a unique token, valid during 24 hours,
allowing the user to reset its password. This token is highly
sensitive ; as an attacker able to retrieve it would be able to resets
the user's password. Prior to version 1.2.3, the reset-password URL is
crafted using the "Host" HTTP header of the request sent to request a
password reset. This way, an external attacker could send password
requests for users, but specify a "Host" header of a website that they
control. If the user receiving the mail clicks on the link, the
attacker would retrieve the reset token of the victim and perform
account takeover. Version 1.2.3 fixes this issue.

Lemmy is a link aggregator and forum for the fediverse. Starting in
version 0.17.0 and prior to version 0.19.1, users can report private
messages, even when they're neither sender nor recipient of the
message. The API response to creating a private message report
contains the private message itself, which means any user can just
iterate over message ids to (loudly) obtain all private messages of an
instance. A user with instance admin privileges can also abuse this if
the private message is removed from the response, as they're able to
see the resulting reports. Creating a private message report by
POSTing to `/api/v3/private_message/report` does not validate whether
the reporter is the recipient of the message. lemmy-ui does not allow
the sender to report the message; the API method should likely be
restricted to accessible to recipients only. The API response when
creating a report contains the `private_message_report_view` with all
the details of the report, including the private message that has been
reported: Any authenticated user can obtain arbitrary (untargeted)
private message contents. Privileges required depend on the instance
configuration; when registrations are enabled without application
system, the privileges required are practically none. When
registration applications are required, privileges required could be
considered low, but this assessment heavily varies by instance.
Version 0.19.1 contains a patch for this issue. A workaround is
available. If an update to a fixed Lemmy version is not immediately
possible, the API route can be blocked in the reverse proxy. This will
prevent anyone from reporting private messages, but it will also
prevent exploitation before the update has been applied.

Tuta is an encrypted email service. Starting in version 3.118.12 and
prior to version 3.119.10, an attacker is able to send a manipulated
email so that the user can no longer use the app to get access to
received emails. By sending a manipulated email, an attacker could put
the app into an unusable state. In this case, a user can no longer
access received e-mails. Since the vulnerability affects not only the
app, but also the web application, a user in this case has no way to
access received emails. This issue was tested with iOS and the web
app, but it is possible all clients are affected. Version 3.119.10

The Binance Trust Wallet app for iOS in commit
3cd6e8f647fbba8b5d8844fcd144365a086b629f, git tag 0.0.4 misuses the
trezor-crypto library and consequently generates mnemonic words for
which the device time is the only entropy source, leading to economic
losses, as exploited in the wild in July 2023. An attacker can
systematically generate mnemonics for each timestamp within an
applicable timeframe, and link them to specific wallet addresses in
order to steal funds from those wallets.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/06/1

Malicious code execution via path traversal in Apache Software
Foundation Apache Sling Servlets Resolver.This issue affects all
version of Apache Sling Servlets Resolver before 2.11.0. However,
whether a system is vulnerable to this attack depends on the exact
configuration of the system. If the system is vulnerable, a user with
write access to the repository might be able to trick the Sling
Servlet Resolver to load a previously uploaded script. Users are
recommended to upgrade to version 2.11.0, which fixes this issue. It
is recommended to upgrade, regardless of whether your system
configuration currently allows this attack or not.

Reference: MISC:https://www.personalausweisportal.de/

The Online-Ausweis-Funktion eID scheme in the German National Identity
card through 2024-02-15 allows authentication bypass by spoofing. A
man-in-the-middle attacker can assume a victim's identify for access
to government, medical, and financial resources, and can also extract
personal data from the card, aka the "sPACE (Spoofing Password
Authenticated Connection Establishment)" issue. This occurs because of
a combination of factors, such as insecure PIN entry (for basic
readers) and eid:// deeplinking. The victim must be using a modified
eID kernel, which may occur if the victim is tricked into installing a
fake version of an official app. NOTE: the BSI position is "ensuring a
secure operational environment at the client side is an obligation of
the ID card owner."

The Apache Xerces C++ XML parser on versions 3.0.0 before 3.2.5
contains a use-after-free error triggered during the scanning of
external DTDs. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 3.2.5 which
fixes the issue, or mitigate the issue by disabling DTD processing.
This can be accomplished via the DOM using a standard parser feature,
or via SAX using the XERCES_DISABLE_DTD environment variable. This
issue has been disclosed before as CVE-2018-1311, but unfortunately
that advisory incorrectly stated the issue would be fixed in version
3.2.3 or 3.2.4.

Dolibarr is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) and customer
relationship management (CRM) software package. Version 18.0.4 has a
HTML Injection vulnerability in the Home page of the Dolibarr
Application. This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary
HTML tags and manipulate the rendered content in the application's
response. Specifically, I was able to successfully inject a new HTML
tag into the returned document and, as a result, was able to comment
out some part of the Dolibarr App Home page HTML code. This behavior
can be exploited to perform various attacks like Cross-Site Scripting
(XSS). To remediate the issue, validate and sanitize all user-supplied
input, especially within HTML attributes, to prevent HTML injection
attacks; and implement proper output encoding when rendering user-
provided data to ensure it is treated as plain text rather than
executable HTML.

TablePress is a table plugin for Wordpress. For importing tables,
TablePress makes external HTTP requests based on a URL that is
provided by the user. That user input is filtered insufficiently,
which makes it is possible to send requests to unintended network
locations and receive responses. On sites in a cloud environment like
AWS, an attacker can potentially make GET requests to the instance's
metadata REST API. If the instance's configuration is insecure, this
can lead to the exposure of internal data, including credentials. This

aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio
and Python. Security-sensitive parts of the Python HTTP parser
retained minor differences in allowable character sets, that must
trigger error handling to robustly match frame boundaries of proxies
in order to protect against injection of additional requests.
Additionally, validation could trigger exceptions that were not
handled consistently with processing of other malformed input. Being
more lenient than internet standards require could, depending on
deployment environment, assist in request smuggling. The unhandled
exception could cause excessive resource consumption on the
application server and/or its logging facilities. This vulnerability
exists due to an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-47627. Version 3.9.2

OpenRefine is a free, open source power tool for working with messy
data and improving it. A jdbc attack vulnerability exists in
OpenRefine(version<=3.7.7) where an attacker may construct a JDBC
query which may read files on the host filesystem. Due to the newer
MySQL driver library in the latest version of OpenRefine (8.0.30),
there is no associated deserialization utilization point, so original
code execution cannot be achieved, but attackers can use this
vulnerability to read sensitive files on the target server. This issue
has been addressed in version 3.7.8. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Suricata is a network Intrusion Detection System, Intrusion Prevention
System and Network Security Monitoring engine. Prior to versions
6.0.16 and 7.0.3, an attacker can craft traffic to cause Suricata to
use far more CPU and memory for processing the traffic than needed,
which can lead to extreme slow downs and denial of service. This
vulnerability is patched in 6.0.16 or 7.0.3. Workarounds include
disabling the affected protocol app-layer parser in the yaml and
reducing the `stream.reassembly.depth` value helps reduce the severity
of the issue.

TrueLayer.NET is the .Net client for TrueLayer. The vulnerability
could potentially allow a malicious actor to gain control over the
destination URL of the HttpClient used in the API classes. For
applications using the SDK, requests to unexpected resources on local
networks or to the internet could be made which could lead to
information disclosure. The issue can be mitigated by having strict
egress rules limiting the destinations to which requests can be made,
and applying strict validation to any user input passed to the
`truelayer-dotnet` library. Versions of TrueLayer.Client `v1.6.0` and
later are not affected.

upon is exposed to the owner of the watcher. It's important to note
that only the path is exposed by this vulnerability, not the data of
znode, but since znode path can contain sensitive information like
user name or login ID, this issue is potentially critical. Users are
recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.2, 3.8.4 which fixes the issue.

frameworks. The `@urql/next` package is vulnerable to XSS. To exploit
this an attacker would need to ensure that the response returns `html`
tags and that the web-application is using streamed responses (non-
RSC). This vulnerability is due to improper escaping of html-like
characters in the response-stream. To fix this vulnerability upgrade
to version 1.1.1

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software
containerization. The classic builder cache system is prone to cache
poisoning if the image is built FROM scratch. Also, changes to some
instructions (most important being HEALTHCHECK and ONBUILD) would not
cause a cache miss. An attacker with the knowledge of the Dockerfile
someone is using could poison their cache by making them pull a
specially crafted image that would be considered as a valid cache
candidate for some build steps. 23.0+ users are only affected if they
explicitly opted out of Buildkit (DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 environment
variable) or are using the /build API endpoint. All users on versions
older than 23.0 could be impacted. Image build API endpoint (/build)
and ImageBuild function from github.com/docker/docker/client is also
affected as it the uses classic builder by default. Patches are
included in 24.0.9 and 25.0.2 releases.

Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the EVM. There is an
error in the stack management when compiling the `IR` for `sha3_64`.
Concretely, the `height` variable is miscalculated. The vulnerability
can't be triggered without writing the `IR` by hand (that is, it
cannot be triggered from regular vyper code). `sha3_64` is used for
retrieval in mappings. No flow that would cache the `key` was found so
the issue shouldn't be possible to trigger when compiling the
compiler-generated `IR`. This issue isn't triggered during normal
compilation of vyper code so the impact is low. At the time of
publication there is no patch available.

Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine. When calls to external contracts are made, we write the input
buffer starting at byte 28, and allocate the return buffer to start at
byte 0 (overlapping with the input buffer). When checking
RETURNDATASIZE for dynamic types, the size is compared only to the
minimum allowed size for that type, and not to the returned value's
length. As a result, malformed return data can cause the contract to
mistake data from the input buffer for returndata. When the called
contract returns invalid ABIv2 encoded data, the calling contract can
read different invalid data (from the dirty buffer) than the called
contract returned.

Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual
machine. In versions 0.3.10 and earlier, the bounds check for slices
does not account for the ability for start + length to overflow when
the values aren't literals. If a slice() function uses a non-literal
argument for the start or length variable, this creates the ability
for an attacker to overflow the bounds check. This issue can be used
to do OOB access to storage, memory or calldata addresses. It can also
be used to corrupt the length slot of the respective array.

Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine. Arrays can be keyed by a signed integer, while they are
defined for unsigned integers only. The typechecker doesn't throw when
spotting the usage of an `int` as an index for an array. The
typechecker allows the usage of signed integers to be used as indexes
to arrays. The vulnerability is present in different forms in all
versions, including `0.3.10`. For ints, the 2's complement
representation is used. Because the array was declared very large, the
bounds checking will pass Negative values will simply be represented
as very large numbers. As of time of publication, a fixed version does
not exist. There are three potential vulnerability classes:
unpredictable behavior, accessing inaccessible elements and denial of
service. Class 1: If it is possible to index an array with a negative
integer without reverting, this is most likely not anticipated by the
developer and such accesses can cause unpredictable behavior for the
contract. Class 2: If a contract has an invariant in the form `assert
index < x`, the developer will suppose that no elements on indexes `y
| y >= x` are accessible. However, by using negative indexes, this can
be bypassed. Class 3: If the index is dependent on the state of the
contract, this poses a risk of denial of service. If the state of the
contract can be manipulated in such way that the index will be forced
to be negative, the array access can always revert (because most
likely the array won't be declared extremely large). However, all
these the scenarios are highly unlikely. Most likely behavior is a
revert on the bounds check.

Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual
machine. Vyper compiler allows passing a value in builtin raw_call
even if the call is a delegatecall or a staticcall. But in the context
of delegatecall and staticcall the handling of value is not possible
due to the semantics of the respective opcodes, and vyper will
silently ignore the value= argument. If the semantics of the EVM are
unknown to the developer, he could suspect that by specifying the
`value` kwarg, exactly the given amount will be sent along to the
target. This vulnerability affects 0.3.10 and earlier versions.

vulnerable to a partial-path traversal bypass. To be vulnerable to the
bypass, the application must use toolkit version <=1.1.1, use
ZipSecurity as a guard against path traversal, and have an exploit
path. Although the control still protects attackers from escaping the
application path into higher level directories (e.g., /etc/), it will
allow "escaping" into sibling paths. For example, if your running path
is /my/app/path you an attacker could navigate into /my/app/path-
something-else. This vulnerability is patched in 1.1.2.

loop to parse the user-provided spec string. There is an edge-case
during parsing that allows a bad actor to force the loop conditions to
access arbitrary memory. Potentially, this could also leak memory if
the extracted rev spec is reflected back to the attacker. As such,
libgit2 versions before 1.4.0 are not affected. Users should upgrade
to version 1.6.5 or 1.7.2.

libgit2 is a portable C implementation of the Git core methods
provided as a linkable library with a solid API, allowing to build Git
functionality into your application. Using well-crafted inputs to
`git_index_add` can cause heap corruption that could be leveraged for
arbitrary code execution. There is an issue in the `has_dir_name`
function in `src/libgit2/index.c`, which frees an entry that should
not be freed. The freed entry is later used and overwritten with
potentially bad actor-controlled data leading to controlled heap
corruption. Depending on the application that uses libgit2, this could
lead to arbitrary code execution. This issue has been patched in
version 1.6.5 and 1.7.2.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/security/advisories/GHSA-q967-q4j8-637h

RaspberryMatic is an open-source operating system for HomeMatic
internet-of-things devices. RaspberryMatic / OCCU prior to version
3.75.6.20240316 contains a unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE)
vulnerability, caused by multiple issues within the Java based
`HMIPServer.jar` component. RaspberryMatric includes a Java based
`HMIPServer`, that can be accessed through URLs starting with
`/pages/jpages`. The `FirmwareController` class does however not
perform any session id checks, thus this feature can be accessed
without a valid session. Due to this issue, attackers can gain remote
code execution as root user, allowing a full system compromise.
Version 3.75.6.20240316 contains a patch.

stereoscope is a go library for processing container images and
simulating a squash filesystem. Prior to version 0.0.1, it is possible
to craft an OCI tar archive that, when stereoscope attempts to
unarchive the contents, will result in writing to paths outside of the
unarchive temporary directory. Specifically, use of
`github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/file.UntarToDirectory()` function,
the
`github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image/oci.TarballImageProvider`
struct, or the higher level
`github.com/anchore/stereoscope/pkg/image.Image.Read()` function
express this vulnerability. As a workaround, if you are using the OCI
archive as input into stereoscope then you can switch to using an OCI
layout by unarchiving the tar archive and provide the unarchived
directory to stereoscope.

MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage. When someone creates an
access key, it inherits the permissions of the parent key. Not only
for `s3:*` actions, but also `admin:*` actions. Which means unless
somewhere above in the access-key hierarchy, the `admin` rights are
denied, access keys will be able to simply override their own `s3`
permissions to something more permissive. The vulnerability is fixed

Bref enable serverless PHP on AWS Lambda. When Bref is used with the
Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a
`RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a
PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a
MultiPart, each part is parsed and for each which contains a file, it
is extracted and saved in `/tmp` with a random filename starting with
`bref_upload_`. The flow mimics what plain PHP does but it does not
delete the temporary files when the request has been processed. An
attacker could fill the Lambda instance disk by performing multiple
MultiPart requests containing files. This vulnerability is patched in
2.1.13.

Bref enable serverless PHP on AWS Lambda. When Bref is used in
combination with an API Gateway with the v2 format, it does not handle
multiple values headers. If PHP generates a response with two headers
having the same key but different values only the latest one is kept.
If an application relies on multiple headers with the same key being
set for security reasons, then Bref would lower the application
security. For example, if an application sets multiple `Content-
Security-Policy` headers, then Bref would just reflect the latest one.
This vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13.

Bref enable serverless PHP on AWS Lambda. When Bref is used with the
Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a
`RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a
PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a
MultiPart, each part is parsed and its content added in the `$files`
or `$parsedBody` arrays. The conversion process produces a different
output compared to the one of plain PHP when keys ending with and open
square bracket ([) are used. Based on the application logic the
difference in the body parsing might lead to vulnerabilities and/or
undefined behaviors. This vulnerability is patched in 2.1.13.

`python-multipart` is a streaming multipart parser for Python. When
using form data, `python-multipart` uses a Regular Expression to parse
the HTTP `Content-Type` header, including options. An attacker could
send a custom-made `Content-Type` option that is very difficult for
the RegEx to process, consuming CPU resources and stalling
indefinitely (minutes or more) while holding the main event loop. This
means that process can't handle any more requests, leading to regular
expression denial of service. This vulnerability has been patched in
version 0.0.7.

Open Forms allows users create and publish smart forms. Versions prior
to 2.2.9, 2.3.7, 2.4.5, and 2.5.2 contain a non-exploitable multi-
factor authentication weakness. Superusers who have their credentials
(username + password) compromised could potentially have the second-
factor authentication bypassed if an attacker somehow managed to
authenticate to Open Forms. The maintainers of Open Forms do not
believe it is or has been possible to perform this login. However, if
this were possible, the victim's account may be abused to view
(potentially sensitive) submission data or have been used to
impersonate other staff accounts to view and/or modify data. Three
mitigating factors to help prevent exploitation include: the usual
login page (at `/admin/login/`) does not fully log in the user until
the second factor was succesfully provided; the additional non-MFA
protected login page at `/api/v2/api-authlogin/` was misconfigured and
could not be used to log in; and there are no additional ways to log
in. This also requires credentials of a superuser to be compromised to
be exploitable. Versions 2.2.9, 2.3.7, 2.4.5, and 2.5.2 contain the
following patches to address these weaknesses: Move and only enable
the API auth endpoints (`/api/v2/api-auth/login/`) with
`settings.DEBUG = True`. `settings.DEBUG = True` is insecure and
should never be applied in production settings. Additionally, apply a
custom permission check to the hijack flow to only allow second-
factor-verified superusers to perform user hijacking.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/11/1

libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous
I/O. The `uv_getaddrinfo` function in `src/unix/getaddrinfo.c` (and
its windows counterpart `src/win/getaddrinfo.c`), truncates hostnames
to 256 characters before calling `getaddrinfo`. This behavior can be
exploited to create addresses like `0x00007f000001`, which are
considered valid by `getaddrinfo` and could allow an attacker to craft
payloads that resolve to unintended IP addresses, bypassing developer
checks. The vulnerability arises due to how the `hostname_ascii`
variable (with a length of 256 bytes) is handled in `uv_getaddrinfo`
and subsequently in `uv__idna_toascii`. When the hostname exceeds 256
characters, it gets truncated without a terminating null byte. As a
result attackers may be able to access internal APIs or for websites
(similar to MySpace) that allows users to have `username.example.com`
pages. Internal services that crawl or cache these user pages can be
exposed to SSRF attacks if a malicious user chooses a long vulnerable
username. This issue has been addressed in release version 1.48.0.
Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00004.html

mod_auth_openidc is an OpenID Certified&#8482; authentication and
authorization module for the Apache 2.x HTTP server that implements
the OpenID Connect Relying Party functionality. In affected versions
missing input validation on mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie
value makes the server vulnerable to a denial of service (DoS) attack.
An internal security audit has been conducted and the reviewers found
that if they manipulated the value of the
mod_auth_openidc_session_chunks cookie to a very large integer, like
99999999, the server struggles with the request for a long time and
finally gets back with a 500 error. Making a few requests of this kind
caused our server to become unresponsive. Attackers can craft requests
that would make the server work very hard (and possibly become
unresponsive) and/or crash with minimal effort. This issue has been
addressed in version 2.4.15.2. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CKEditor4 is an open source what-you-see-is-what-you-get HTML editor.
A cross-site scripting vulnerability has been discovered in the core
HTML parsing module in versions of CKEditor4 prior to 4.24.0-lts. It
may affect all editor instances that enabled full-page editing mode or
enabled CDATA elements in Advanced Content Filtering configuration
(defaults to `script` and `style` elements). The vulnerability allows
attackers to inject malformed HTML content bypassing Advanced Content
Filtering mechanism, which could result in executing JavaScript code.
An attacker could abuse faulty CDATA content detection and use it to
prepare an intentional attack on the editor. A fix is available in
version 4.24.0-lts.

Discourse Calendar adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in
the first post of a topic on the open-source discussion platform
Discourse. Prior to version 0.4, event invitees created in topics in
private categories or PMs (private messages) can be retrieved by
anyone, even if they're not logged in. This problem is resolved in
version 0.4 of the discourse-calendar plugin. While no known
workaround is available, putting the site behind `login_required` will
disallow this endpoint to be used by anonymous users, but logged in
users can still get the list of invitees in the private topics.

Icinga Web 2 libraries. In affected versions the class
`gipfl\Web\Form` is the base for various concrete form implementations
[1] and provides protection against cross site request forgery (CSRF)
by default. This is done by automatically adding an element with a
CSRF token to any form, unless explicitly disabled, but even if
enabled, the CSRF token (sent during a client's submission of a form
relying on it) is not validated. This enables attackers to perform
changes on behalf of a user which, unknowingly, interacts with a
prepared link or website. The version 0.22.0 is available to remedy
this issue. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

Icinga Director is a tool designed to make Icinga 2 configuration
handling easy. Not any of Icinga Director's configuration forms used
to manipulate the monitoring environment are protected against cross
site request forgery (CSRF). It enables attackers to perform changes
in the monitoring environment managed by Icinga Director without the
awareness of the victim. Users of the map module in version 1.x,
should immediately upgrade to v2.0. The mentioned XSS vulnerabilities
in Icinga Web are already fixed as well and upgrades to the most
recent release of the 2.9, 2.10 or 2.11 branch must be performed if
not done yet. Any later major release is also suitable. Icinga
Director will receive minor updates to the 1.8, 1.9, 1.10 and 1.11
branches to remedy this issue. Upgrade immediately to a patched
release. If that is not feasible, disable the director module for the
time being.

Composer is a dependency Manager for the PHP language. In affected
versions several files within the local working directory are included
during the invocation of Composer and in the context of the executing
user. As such, under certain conditions arbitrary code execution may
lead to local privilege escalation, provide lateral user movement or
malicious code execution when Composer is invoked within a directory
with tampered files. All Composer CLI commands are affected, including
composer.phar's self-update. The following scenarios are of high risk:
Composer being run with sudo, Pipelines which may execute Composer on
untrusted projects, Shared environments with developers who run
Composer individually on the same project. This vulnerability has been
addressed in versions 2.7.0 and 2.2.23. It is advised that the patched
versions are applied at the earliest convenience. Where not possible,
the following should be addressed: Remove all sudo composer privileges
for all users to mitigate root privilege escalation, and avoid running
Composer within an untrusted directory, or if needed, verify that the
contents of `vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php` and
`vendor/composer/installed.php` do not include untrusted code. A reset
can also be done on these files by the following:```sh rm
vendor/composer/installed.php vendor/composer/InstalledVersions.php
composer install --no-scripts --no-plugins ```

Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in
version 4.3.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, reauthenticating
with an existing session cookie would re-use that session id, even if
for different user credentials. In this case, the pre-existing session
could be used to gain elevated access to an existing Graylog login
session, provided the malicious user could successfully inject their
session cookie into someone else's browser. The complexity of such an
attack is high, because it requires presenting a spoofed login screen
and injection of a session cookie into an existing browser,
potentially through a cross-site scripting attack. No such attack has
been discovered. Graylog 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, and any versions of the 6.0
development branch, contain patches to not re-use sessions under any
circumstances. Some workarounds are available. Using short session
expiration and explicit log outs of unused sessions can help limiting
the attack vector. Unpatched this vulnerability exists, but is
relatively hard to exploit. A proxy could be leveraged to clear the
`authentication` cookie for the Graylog server URL for the
`/api/system/sessions` endpoint, as that is the only one vulnerable.

Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Starting in
version 2.0.0 and prior to versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4, arbitrary
classes can be loaded and instantiated using a HTTP PUT request to the
`/api/system/cluster_config/` endpoint. Graylog's cluster config
system uses fully qualified class names as config keys. To validate
the existence of the requested class before using them, Graylog loads
the class using the class loader. If a user with the appropriate
permissions performs the request, arbitrary classes with 1-arg String
constructors can be instantiated. This will execute arbitrary code
that is run during class instantiation. In the specific use case of
`java.io.File`, the behavior of the internal web-server stack will
lead to information exposure by including the entire file content in
the response to the REST request. Versions 5.1.11 and 5.2.4 contain a
fix for this issue.

Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds
read was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.1. The vulnerable function,
`QuickTimeVideo::NikonTagsDecoder`, was new in v0.28.0, so Exiv2
versions before v0.28 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds read is
triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted video
file. In most cases this out of bounds read will result in a crash.
This bug is fixed in version v0.28.2. Users are advised to upgrade.

Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Without
a rate limit on the POST /uploads endpoint, it makes it easier for an
attacker to carry out a DoS attack on the server since creating an
upload can be a resource intensive process. Do note that the impact
varies from site to site as various site settings like
`max_image_size_kb`, `max_attachment_size_kb` and
`max_image_megapixels` will determine the amount of resources used
when creating an upload. The issue is patched in the latest stable,
beta and tests-passed version of Discourse. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should reduce `max_image_size_kb`,
`max_attachment_size_kb` and `max_image_megapixels` as smaller uploads
require less resources to process. Alternatively,
`client_max_body_size` can be reduced in Nginx to prevent large
uploads from reaching the server.

pkg is tool design to bundle Node.js projects into an executables. Any
native code packages built by `pkg` are written to a hardcoded
directory. On unix systems, this is `/tmp/pkg/*` which is a shared
directory for all users on the same local system. There is no
uniqueness to the package names within this directory, they are
predictable. An attacker who has access to the same local system has
the ability to replace the genuine executables in the shared directory
with malicious executables of the same name. A user may then run the
malicious executable without realising it has been modified. This
package is deprecated. Therefore, there will not be a patch provided
for this vulnerability. To check if your executable build by pkg
depends on native code and is vulnerable, run the executable and check
if `/tmp/pkg/` was created. Users should transition to actively
maintained alternatives. We would recommend investigating Node.js 21&#8217;s
support for single executable applications. Given the decision to
deprecate the pkg package, there are no official workarounds or
remediations provided by our team. Users should prioritize migrating
to other packages that offer similar functionality with enhanced
security.

Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform.
Sentry&#8217;s integration platform provides a way for external services to
interact with Sentry. One of such integrations, the Phabricator
integration (maintained by Sentry) with version <=24.1.1 contains a
constrained SSRF vulnerability. An attacker could make Sentry send
POST HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs (including internal IP addresses)
by providing an unsanitized input to the Phabricator integration.
However, the body payload is constrained to a specific format. If an
attacker has access to a Sentry instance, this allows them to: 1.
interact with internal network; 2. scan local/remote ports. This issue
has been fixed in Sentry self-hosted release 24.1.2, and has already
been mitigated on sentry.io on February 8. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Name: CVE-2024-24830
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/security/advisories/GHSA-hfxx-g56f-8h5v
Reference: URL:https://github.com/openobserve/openobserve/security/advisories/GHSA-hfxx-g56f-8h5v

OpenObserve is a observability platform built specifically for logs,
metrics, traces, analytics, designed to work at petabyte scale. A
vulnerability has been identified in the "/api/{org_id}/users"
endpoint. This vulnerability allows any authenticated regular user
('member') to add new users with elevated privileges, including the
'root' role, to an organization. This issue circumvents the intended
security controls for role assignments. The vulnerability resides in
the user creation process, where the payload does not validate the
user roles. A regular user can manipulate the payload to assign root-
level privileges. This vulnerability leads to Unauthorized Privilege
Escalation and significantly compromises the application's role-based
access control system. It allows unauthorized control over application
resources and poses a risk to data security. All users, particularly
those in administrative roles, are impacted. This issue has been
addressed in release version 0.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

OpenObserve is a observability platform built specifically for logs,
metrics, traces, analytics, designed to work at petabyte scale. A
critical vulnerability has been identified in the
"/api/{org_id}/users/{email_id}" endpoint. This vulnerability allows
any authenticated user within an organization to remove any other user
from that same organization, irrespective of their respective roles.
This includes the ability to remove users with "Admin" and "Root"
roles. By enabling any organizational member to unilaterally alter the
user base, it opens the door to unauthorized access and can cause
considerable disruptions in operations. The core of the vulnerability
lies in the `remove_user_from_org` function in the user management
system. This function is designed to allow organizational users to
remove members from their organization. The function does not check if
the user initiating the request has the appropriate administrative
privileges to remove a user. Any user who is part of the organization,
irrespective of their role, can remove any other user, including those
with higher privileges. This vulnerability is categorized as an
Authorization issue leading to Unauthorized User Removal. The impact
is severe, as it compromises the integrity of user management within
organizations. By exploiting this vulnerability, any user within an
organization, without the need for administrative privileges, can
remove critical users, including "Admins" and "Root" users. This could
result in unauthorized system access, administrative lockout, or
operational disruptions. Given that user accounts are typically
created by "Admins" or "Root" users, this vulnerability can be
exploited by any user who has been granted access to an organization,
thereby posing a critical risk to the security and operational
stability of the application. This issue has been addressed in release
version 0.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

WikiDiscover is an extension designed for use with a CreateWiki
managed farm to display wikis. On Special:WikiDiscover, the
`Language::date` function is used when making the human-readable
timestamp for inclusion on the wiki_creation column. This function
uses interface messages to translate the names of months and days. It
uses the `->text()` output mode, returning unescaped interface
messages. Since the output is not escaped later, the unescaped
interface message is included on the output, resulting in an XSS
vulnerability. Exploiting this on-wiki requires the `(editinterface)`
right. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `267e763a0`.
Users are advised to update their installations. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

Pixelfed is an open source photo sharing platform. When processing
requests authorization was improperly and insufficiently checked,
allowing attackers to access far more functionality than users
intended, including to the administrative and moderator functionality
of the Pixelfed server. This vulnerability affects every version of
Pixelfed between v0.10.4 and v0.11.9, inclusive. A proof of concept of
this vulnerability exists. This vulnerability affects every local user
of a Pixelfed server, and can potentially affect the servers' ability
to federate. Some user interaction is required to setup the conditions
to be able to exercise the vulnerability, but the attacker could
conduct this attack time-delayed manner, where user interaction is not
actively required. This vulnerability has been addressed in version
0.11.11. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
for this vulnerability.

php-svg-lib is a scalable vector graphics (SVG) file parsing/rendering
library. Prior to version 0.5.2, php-svg-lib fails to validate that
font-family doesn't contain a PHAR url, which might leads to RCE on
PHP < 8.0, and doesn't validate if external references are allowed.
This might leads to bypass of restrictions or RCE on projects that are
using it, if they do not strictly revalidate the fontName that is
passed by php-svg-lib. The `Style::fromAttributes(`), or the
`Style::parseCssStyle()` should check the content of the `font-family`
and prevents it to use a PHAR url, to avoid passing an invalid and
dangerous `fontName` value to other libraries. The same check as done
in the `Style::fromStyleSheets` might be reused. Libraries using this
library as a dependency might be vulnerable to some bypass of
restrictions, or even remote code execution, if they do not double
check the value of the `fontName` that is passed by php-svg-lib.
Version 0.5.2 contains a fix for this issue.

MSS (Mission Support System) is an open source package designed for
planning atmospheric research flights. In file: `index.py`, there is a
method that is vulnerable to path manipulation attack. By modifying
file paths, an attacker can acquire sensitive information from
different resources. The `filename` variable is joined with other
variables to form a file path in `_file`. However, `filename` is a
route parameter that can capture path type values i.e. values
including slashes (\). So it is possible for an attacker to manipulate
the file being read by assigning a value containing ../ to `filename`
and so the attacker may be able to gain access to other files on the
host filesystem. This issue has been addressed in MSS version 8.3.3.
Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

Fiber is a web framework written in go. Prior to version 2.52.1, the
CORS middleware allows for insecure configurations that could
potentially expose the application to multiple CORS-related
vulnerabilities. Specifically, it allows setting the Access-Control-
Allow-Origin header to a wildcard (`*`) while also having the Access-
Control-Allow-Credentials set to true, which goes against recommended
security best practices. The impact of this misconfiguration is high
as it can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive user data and
expose the system to various types of attacks listed in the
PortSwigger article linked in the references. Version 2.52.1 contains
a patch for this issue. As a workaround, users may manually validate
the CORS configurations in their implementation to ensure that they do
not allow a wildcard origin when credentials are enabled. The browser
fetch api, as well as browsers and utilities that enforce CORS
policies, are not affected by this.

Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Carefully crafted content
type headers can cause Rack&#8217;s media type parser to take much longer
than expected, leading to a possible denial of service vulnerability
(ReDos 2nd degree polynomial). This vulnerability is patched in
3.0.9.1 and 2.2.8.1.

Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top
of Flask. When Flask-AppBuilder is set to AUTH_TYPE AUTH_OID, it
allows an attacker to forge an HTTP request, that could deceive the
backend into using any requested OpenID service. This vulnerability
could grant an attacker unauthorised privilege access if a custom
OpenID service is deployed by the attacker and accessible by the
backend. This vulnerability is only exploitable when the application
is using the OpenID 2.0 authorization protocol. Upgrade to Flask-
AppBuilder 4.3.11 to fix the vulnerability.

The CodeQL CLI repo holds binaries for the CodeQL command line
interface (CLI). Prior to version 2.16.3, an XML parser used by the
CodeQL CLI to read various auxiliary files is vulnerable to an XML
External Entity attack. If a vulnerable version of the CLI is used to
process either a maliciously modified CodeQL database, or a specially
prepared set of QL query sources, the CLI can be made to make an
outgoing HTTP request to an URL that contains material read from a
local file chosen by the attacker. This may result in a loss of
privacy of exfiltration of secrets. Security researchers and QL
authors who receive databases or QL source files from untrusted
sources may be impacted. A single untrusted `.ql` or `.qll` file
cannot be affected, but a zip archive or tarball containing QL sources
may unpack auxiliary files that will trigger an attack when CodeQL
sees them in the file system. Those using CodeQL for routine analysis
of source trees with a preselected set of trusted queries are not
affected. In particular, extracting XML files from a source tree into
the CodeQL database does not make one vulnerable. The problem is fixed
in release 2.16.3 of the CodeQL CLI. Other than upgrading, workarounds
include not accepting CodeQL databases or queries from untrusted
sources, or only processing such material on a machine without an
Internet connection. Customers who use older releases of CodeQL for
security scanning in an automated CI system and cannot upgrade for
compliance reasons can continue using that version. That use case is
safe. If such customers have a private query pack and use the `codeql
pack create` command to precompile them before using them in the CI
system, they should be using the production CodeQL release to run
`codeql pack create`. That command is safe as long as the QL source it
precompiled is trusted. All other development of the query pack should
use an upgraded CLI.

** DISPUTED ** A default installation of RustDesk 1.2.3 on Windows
places a WDKTestCert certificate under Trusted Root Certification
Authorities with Enhanced Key Usage of Code Signing
(1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3), valid from 2023 until 2033. This is potentially
unwanted, e.g., because there is no public documentation of security
measures for the private key, and arbitrary software could be signed
if the private key were to be compromised. NOTE: the vendor's position
is "we do not have EV cert, so we use test cert as a workaround."
Insertion into Trusted Root Certification Authorities was the
originally intended behavior, and the UI ensured that the certificate
installation step (checked by default) was visible to the user before
proceeding with the product installation.

Squid is an open source caching proxy for the Web supporting HTTP,
HTTPS, FTP, and more. Due to a Collapse of Data into Unsafe Value bug
,Squid may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack against HTTP
header parsing. This problem allows a remote client or a remote server
to perform Denial of Service when sending oversized headers in HTTP
messages. In versions of Squid prior to 6.5 this can be achieved if
the request_header_max_size or reply_header_max_size settings are
unchanged from the default. In Squid version 6.5 and later, the
default setting of these parameters is safe. Squid will emit a
critical warning in cache.log if the administrator is setting these
parameters to unsafe values. Squid will not at this time prevent these
settings from being changed to unsafe values. Users are advised to
upgrade to version 6.5. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as SQUID-2024:2

Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on
ActivityPub. Mastodon allows new identities from configured
authentication providers (CAS, SAML, OIDC) to attach to existing local
users with the same e-mail address. This results in a possible account
takeover if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail
address or multiple authentication providers are configured. When a
user logs in through an external authentication provider for the first
time, Mastodon checks the e-mail address passed by the provider to
find an existing account. However, using the e-mail address alone
means that if the authentication provider allows changing the e-mail
address of an account, the Mastodon account can immediately be
hijacked. All users logging in through external authentication
providers are affected. The severity is medium, as it also requires
the external authentication provider to misbehave. However, some well-
known OIDC providers (like Microsoft Azure) make it very easy to
accidentally allow unverified e-mail changes. Moreover, OpenID Connect
also allows dynamic client registration. This issue has been addressed
in versions 4.2.6, 4.1.14, 4.0.14, and 3.5.18. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on
ActivityPub. When an OAuth Application is destroyed, the streaming
server wasn't being informed that the Access Tokens had also been
destroyed, this could have posed security risks to users by allowing
an application to continue listening to streaming after the
application had been destroyed. Essentially this comes down to the
fact that when Doorkeeper sets up the relationship between
Applications and Access Tokens, it uses a `dependent: delete_all`
configuration, which means the `after_commit` callback setup on
`AccessTokenExtension` didn't actually fire, since `delete_all`
doesn't trigger ActiveRecord callbacks. To mitigate, we need to add a
`before_destroy` callback to `ApplicationExtension` which announces to
streaming that all the Application's Access Tokens are being "killed".
Impact should be negligible given the affected application had to be
owned by the user. None the less this issue has been addressed in
versions 4.2.6, 4.1.14, 4.0.14, and 3.5.18. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workaround for this vulnerability.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-
configured Kubernetes resources. When either the Helm client or SDK is
used to save a chart whose name within the `Chart.yaml` file includes
a relative path change, the chart would be saved outside its expected
directory based on the changes in the relative path. The validation
and linting did not detect the path changes in the name. This issue
has been resolved in Helm v3.14.1. Users unable to upgrade should
check all charts used by Helm for path changes in their name as found
in the `Chart.yaml` file. This includes dependencies.

Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on
ActivityPub. Prior to versions 4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, and 3.5.19, when
fetching remote statuses, Mastodon doesn't check that the response
from the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the
Activity Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a
crafted Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a
Mastodon server fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user
uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate an
account on a remote server that satisfies all of the following
properties: allows the attacker to register an account; accepts
arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same domain
as the ActivityPub actors; and serves user-uploaded document in
response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the Activity
Streams media type. Versions 4.2.7, 4.1.15, 4.0.15, and 3.5.19 contain
a fix for this issue.

Pimcore's Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore. A
potential security vulnerability has been discovered in
`pimcore/admin-ui-classic-bundle` prior to version 1.3.4. The
vulnerability involves a Host Header Injection in the
`invitationLinkAction` function of the UserController, specifically in
the way `$loginUrl` trusts user input. The host header from incoming
HTTP requests is used unsafely when generating URLs. An attacker can
manipulate the HTTP host header in requests to the
/admin/user/invitationlink endpoint, resulting in the generation of
URLs with the attacker's domain. In fact, if a host header is injected
in the POST request, the $loginURL parameter is constructed with this
unvalidated host header. It is then used to send an invitation email
to the provided user. This vulnerability can be used to perform
phishing attacks by making the URLs in the invitation links emails
point to an attacker-controlled domain. Version 1.3.4 contains a patch
for the vulnerability. The maintainers recommend validating the host
header and ensuring it matches the application's domain. It would also
be beneficial to use a default trusted host or hostname if the
incoming host header is not recognized or is absent.

Misskey is an open source, decentralized social media platform with
ActivityPub support. Prior to version 2024.2.0, when fetching remote
Activity Streams objects, Misskey doesn't check that the response from
the remote server has a `Content-Type` header value of the Activity
Streams media type, which allows a threat actor to upload a crafted
Activity Streams document to a remote server and make a Misskey
instance fetch it, if the remote server accepts arbitrary user
uploads. The vulnerability allows a threat actor to impersonate and
take over an account on a remote server that satisfies all of the
following properties: allows the threat actor to register an account;
accepts arbitrary user-uploaded documents and places them on the same
domain as legitimate Activity Streams actors; and serves user-uploaded
document in response to requests with an `Accept` header value of the
Activity Streams media type. Version 2024.2.0 contains a patch for the
issue.

Vulnerability in AMSS++ version 4.31, which does not sufficiently
encode user-controlled input, resulting in a Cross-Site Scripting

`bhyveload -h <host-path>` may be used to grant loader access to the
<host-path> directory tree on the host. Affected versions of
bhyveload(8) do not make any attempt to restrict loader's access to
<host-path>, allowing the loader to read any file the host user has
access to. In the bhyveload(8) model, the host supplies a userboot.so
to boot with, but the loader scripts generally come from the guest
image. A maliciously crafted script could be used to exfiltrate
sensitive data from the host accessible to the user running
bhyhveload(8), which is often the system root.
