The Formidable Form Builder WordPress plugin before 4.09.05 allows to
inject certain HTML Tags like <audio>,<video>,<img>,<a>
and<button>.This could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
exploit a HTML-injection byinjecting a malicous link. The HTML-
injection may trick authenticated users to follow the link. If the
Link gets clicked, Javascript code can be executed. The vulnerability
is due to insufficient sanitization of the "data-frmverify" tag for
links in the web-based entry inspection page of affected systems. A
successful exploitation incomibantion with CSRF could allow the
attacker to perform arbitrary actions on an affected system with the
privileges of the user. These actions include stealing the users
account by changing their password or allowing attackers to submit
their own code through an authenticated user resulting in Remote Code
Execution. If an authenticated user who is able to edit Wordpress PHP
Code in any kind, clicks the malicious link, PHP code can be edited.

The Tatsu WordPress plugin before 3.3.12 add_custom_font action can be
used without prior authentication to upload a rogue zip file which is
uncompressed under the WordPress's upload directory. By adding a PHP
shell with a filename starting with a dot ".", this can bypass
extension control implemented in the plugin. Moreover, there is a race
condition in the zip extraction process which makes the shell file
live long enough on the filesystem to be callable by an attacker.

In BIND 9.5.0 -> 9.11.29, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.13, and versions BIND
9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.29-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 -> 9.16.13-S1 of BIND Supported
Preview Edition, as well as release versions 9.17.0 -> 9.17.1 of the
BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are
running an affected version and are configured to use GSS-TSIG
features. In a configuration which uses BIND's default settings the
vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered
vulnerable by explicitly setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or
tkey-gssapi-credential configuration options. Although the default
configuration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in
networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-
server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory
domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC
SPNEGO implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on
the CPU architecture for which BIND was built: For named binaries
compiled for 64-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a
buffer over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries
compiled for 32-bit platforms, this flaw can be used to trigger a
server crash due to a buffer overflow and possibly also to achieve
remote code execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO
implementations are available in the MIT and Heimdal Kerberos
libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering
the ISC implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce
the attack surface for BIND users, we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO
implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it had
already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove
something from a stable ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but
since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO implementation, we
have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and
security.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/26/6

In ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16, ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.2 (Other
branches of ISC DHCP (i.e., releases in the 4.0.x series or lower and
releases in the 4.3.x series) are beyond their End-of-Life (EOL) and
no longer supported by ISC. From inspection it is clear that the
defect is also present in releases from those series, but they have
not been officially tested for the vulnerability), The outcome of
encountering the defect while reading a lease that will trigger it
varies, according to: the component being affected (i.e., dhclient or
dhcpd) whether the package was built as a 32-bit or 64-bit binary
whether the compiler flag -fstack-protection-strong was used when
compiling In dhclient, ISC has not successfully reproduced the error
on a 64-bit system. However, on a 32-bit system it is possible to
cause dhclient to crash when reading an improper lease, which could
cause network connectivity problems for an affected system due to the
absence of a running DHCP client process. In dhcpd, when run in DHCPv4
or DHCPv6 mode: if the dhcpd server binary was built for a 32-bit
architecture AND the -fstack-protection-strong flag was specified to
the compiler, dhcpd may exit while parsing a lease file containing an
objectionable lease, resulting in lack of service to clients.
Additionally, the offending lease and the lease immediately following
it in the lease database may be improperly deleted. if the dhcpd
server binary was built for a 64-bit architecture OR if the -fstack-
protection-strong compiler flag was NOT specified, the crash will not
occur, but it is possible for the offending lease and the lease which
immediately followed it to be improperly deleted.

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/full-system-control-with-new-solarwinds-orion-based-and-serv-u-ftp-vulnerabilities/

The Collector Service in SolarWinds Orion Platform before 2020.2.4
uses MSMQ (Microsoft Message Queue) and doesn't set permissions on its
private queues. As a result, remote unauthenticated clients can send
messages to TCP port 1801 that the Collector Service will process.
Additionally, upon processing of such messages, the service
deserializes them in insecure manner, allowing remote arbitrary code
execution as LocalSystem.

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.trustwave.com/en-us/resources/blogs/spiderlabs-blog/full-system-control-with-new-solarwinds-orion-based-and-serv-u-ftp-vulnerabilities/

SolarWinds Orion Platform before 2020.2.4, as used by various
SolarWinds products, installs and uses a SQL Server backend, and
stores database credentials to access this backend in a file readable
by unprivileged users. As a result, any user having access to the
filesystem can read database login details from that file, including
the login name and its associated password. Then, the credentials can
be used to get database owner access to the SWNetPerfMon.DB database.
This gives access to the data collected by SolarWinds applications,
and leads to admin access to the applications by inserting or changing
authentication data stored in the Accounts table of the database.

In SolarWinds Serv-U before 15.2.2 Hotfix 1, there is a directory
containing user profile files (that include users' password hashes)
that is world readable and writable. An unprivileged Windows user
(having access to the server's filesystem) can add an FTP user by
copying a valid profile file to this directory. For example, if this
profile sets up a user with a C:\ home directory, then the attacker
obtains access to read or replace arbitrary files with LocalSystem
privileges.

"loolforkit" is a privileged program that is supposed to be run by a
special, non-privileged "lool" user. Before doing anything else
"loolforkit" checks, if it was invoked by the "lool" user, and refuses
to run with privileges, if it's not the case. In the vulnerable
version of "loolforkit" this check was wrong, so a normal user could
start "loolforkit" and eventually get local root privileges.

LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros
within documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the
document occurred since the last signing and that the signature is
valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice
allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by
manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream
within the document to combine multiple certificate data, which when
opened caused LibreOffice to display a validly signed indicator but
whose content was unrelated to the signature shown. This issue
affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to
7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.

Each Apache Dubbo server will set a serialization id to tell the
clients which serialization protocol it is working on. But for Dubbo
versions before 2.7.8 or 2.6.9, an attacker can choose which
serialization id the Provider will use by tampering with the byte
preamble flags, aka, not following the server's instruction. This
means that if a weak deserializer such as the Kryo and FST are somehow
in code scope (e.g. if Kryo is somehow a part of a dependency), a
remote unauthenticated attacker can tell the Provider to use the weak
deserializer, and then proceed to exploit it.

Apache Druid includes the ability to execute user-provided JavaScript
code embedded in various types of requests. This functionality is
intended for use in high-trust environments, and is disabled by
default. However, in Druid 0.20.0 and earlier, it is possible for an
authenticated user to send a specially-crafted request that forces
Druid to run user-provided JavaScript code for that request,
regardless of server configuration. This can be leveraged to execute
code on the target machine with the privileges of the Druid server
process.

A file extension handling issue was found in [server] module of
ONLYOFFICE DocumentServer v4.2.0.71-v5.6.0.21. The file extension is
controlled by an attacker through the request data and leads to
arbitrary file overwriting. Using this vulnerability, a remote
attacker can obtain remote code execution on DocumentServer.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2021-25834
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/cosmos/ethermint/issues/686

Cosmos Network Ethermint <= v0.4.0 is affected by a transaction replay
vulnerability in the EVM module. If the victim sends a very large
nonce transaction, the attacker can replay the transaction through the
application.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2021-25835
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/cosmos/ethermint/issues/687
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/cosmos/ethermint/pull/692

Cosmos Network Ethermint <= v0.4.0 is affected by a cross-chain
transaction replay vulnerability in the EVM module. Since ethermint
uses the same chainIDEpoch and signature schemes with ethereum for
compatibility, a verified signature in ethereum is still valid in
ethermint with the same msg content and chainIDEpoch, which enables
"cross-chain transaction replay" attack.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2021-25836
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/cosmos/ethermint/issues/667#issuecomment-759284303

Cosmos Network Ethermint <= v0.4.0 is affected by cache lifecycle
inconsistency in the EVM module. The bytecode set in a FAILED
transaction wrongfully remains in memory(stateObject.code) and is
further written to persistent store at the Endblock stage, which may
be utilized to build honeypot contracts.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2021-25837
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/cosmos/ethermint/issues/667#issuecomment-759284107

Cosmos Network Ethermint <= v0.4.0 is affected by cache lifecycle
inconsistency in the EVM module. Due to the inconsistency between the
Storage caching cycle and the Tx processing cycle, Storage changes
caused by a failed transaction are improperly reserved in memory.
Although the bad storage cache data will be discarded at EndBlock, it
is still valid in the current block, which enables many possible
attacks such as an "arbitrary mint token".

In &#8220;Dolibarr ERP CRM&#8221;, WYSIWYG Editor module, v2.8.1 to v13.0.2 are
affected by a stored XSS vulnerability that allows low privileged
application users to store malicious scripts in the &#8220;Private Note&#8221;

executed in a victim&#8217;s browser when they open the page containing the
vulnerable field. In the worst case, the victim who inadvertently
triggers the attack is a highly privileged administrator. The injected
scripts can extract the Session ID, which can lead to full Account
takeover of the admin and due to other vulnerability (Improper Access
Control on Private notes) a low privileged user can update the private
notes which could lead to privilege escalation.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/23/5

Apache Maven will follow repositories that are defined in a
dependency&#8217;s Project Object Model (pom) which may be surprising to
some users, resulting in potential risk if a malicious actor takes
over that repository or is able to insert themselves into a position
to pretend to be that repository. Maven is changing the default
behavior in 3.8.1+ to no longer follow http (non-SSL) repository
references by default. More details available in the referenced urls.
If you are currently using a repository manager to govern the
repositories used by your builds, you are unaffected by the risks
present in the legacy behavior, and are unaffected by this
vulnerability and change to default behavior. See this link for more
information about repository management:

In the default configuration, Apache MyFaces Core versions 2.2.0 to
2.2.13, 2.3.0 to 2.3.7, 2.3-next-M1 to 2.3-next-M4, and 3.0.0-RC1 use
cryptographically weak implicit and explicit cross-site request
forgery (CSRF) tokens. Due to that limitation, it is possible
(although difficult) for an attacker to calculate a future CSRF token
value and to use that value to trick a user into executing unwanted
actions on an application.

<p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in Microsoft Windows
when Folder redirection has been enabled via Group Policy. When folder
redirection file server is co-located with Terminal server, an
attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability would be able to
begin redirecting another user's personal data to a created
folder.</p> <p>To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker can create a
new folder under the Folder Redirection root path and create a
junction on a newly created User folder. When the new user logs in,
Folder Redirection would start redirecting to the folder and copying
personal data.</p> <p>This elevation of privilege vulnerability can
only be addressed by reconfiguring Folder Redirection with Offline
files and restricting permissions, and NOT via a security update for
affected Windows Servers. See the <strong>FAQ</strong> section of this
CVE for configuration guidance.</p>

** DISPUTED ** PyBitmessage through 0.6.3.2 allows attackers to write
screen captures to Potentially Unwanted Directories via a crafted
apinotifypath value. NOTE: the discoverer states "security mitigation
may not be necessary as there is no evidence yet that these screen

it is unclear whether there are any common use cases in which
apinotifypath is controlled by an attacker.

** DISPUTED ** The ProBot bot through 2021-02-08 for Discord might
allow attackers to interfere with the intended purpose of the "Send an
image when a user joins the server" feature (or possibly have
unspecified other impact) because the uploader web service allows
double extensions (such as .html.jpg) with the text/html content type.
NOTE: there may not be cases in which an uploader web service is
customer controlled; however, the nature of the issue has substantial
interaction with customer controlled configuration. NOTE: the vendor
states "This is just an uploader (like any other one) which uploads
files to cloud storage and accepts various file types. There is no
kind of vulnerability and it won't compromise either the client side
or the server side."

Apache Druid allows users to read data from other database systems
using JDBC. This functionality is to allow trusted users with the
proper permissions to set up lookups or submit ingestion tasks. The
MySQL JDBC driver supports certain properties, which, if left
unmitigated, can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code from a
hacker-controlled malicious MySQL server within Druid server
processes. This issue was addressed in Apache Druid 0.20.2

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/24/1

In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading
data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows
authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended,
such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server
process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid
directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which
allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users
interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows
users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource.
In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by
passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource.

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.11 through 5.10.16, as
used by Xen. To service requests to the PV backend, the driver maps
grant references provided by the frontend. In this process, errors may
be encountered. In one case, an error encountered earlier might be
discarded by later processing, resulting in the caller assuming
successful mapping, and hence subsequent operations trying to access
space that wasn't mapped. In another case, internal state would be
insufficiently updated, preventing safe recovery from the error. This

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 2.6.39 through 5.10.16, as
used in Xen. Block, net, and SCSI backends consider certain errors a
plain bug, deliberately causing a kernel crash. For errors potentially
being at least under the influence of guests (such as out of memory
conditions), it isn't correct to assume a plain bug. Memory
allocations potentially causing such crashes occur only when Linux is
running in PV mode, though. This affects drivers/block/xen-
blkback/blkback.c and drivers/xen/xen-scsiback.c.

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 3.2 through 5.10.16, as
used by Xen. Grant mapping operations often occur in batch hypercalls,
where a number of operations are done in a single hypercall, the
success or failure of each one is reported to the backend driver, and
the backend driver then loops over the results, performing follow-up
actions based on the success or failure of each operation.
Unfortunately, when running in PV mode, the Linux backend drivers
mishandle this: Some errors are ignored, effectively implying their
success from the success of related batch elements. In other cases,
errors resulting from one batch element lead to further batch elements
not being inspected, and hence successful ones to not be possible to
properly unmap upon error recovery. Only systems with Linux backends
running in PV mode are vulnerable. Linux backends run in HVM / PVH
modes are not vulnerable. This affects arch/*/xen/p2m.c and
drivers/xen/gntdev.c.

An issue was discovered in Xen 4.9 through 4.14.x. On Arm, a guest is
allowed to control whether memory accesses are bypassing the cache.
This means that Xen needs to ensure that all writes (such as the ones
during scrubbing) have reached the memory before handing over the page
to a guest. Unfortunately, the operation to clean the cache is
happening before checking if the page was scrubbed. Therefore there is
no guarantee when all the writes will reach the memory.

In SPIRE 0.8.1 through 0.8.4 and before versions 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3
and 0.12.1, specially crafted requests to the FetchX509SVID RPC of
SPIRE Server&#8217;s Legacy Node API can result in the possible issuance of
an X.509 certificate with a URI SAN for a SPIFFE ID that the agent is
not authorized to distribute. Proper controls are in place to require
that the caller presents a valid agent certificate that is already

Name: CVE-2021-27099
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/spiffe/spire/security/advisories/GHSA-q7gm-mjrg-44h9

In SPIRE before versions 0.8.5, 0.9.4, 0.10.2, 0.11.3 and 0.12.1, the
"aws_iid" Node Attestor improperly normalizes the path provided
through the agent ID templating feature, which may allow the issuance
of an arbitrary SPIFFE ID within the same trust domain, if the
attacker controls the value of an EC2 tag prior to attestation, and
the attestor is configured for agent ID templating where the tag value
is the last element in the path. This issue has been fixed in SPIRE
versions 0.11.3 and 0.12.1

** DISPUTED ** Moodle 3.10.1 is vulnerable to persistent/stored cross-
site scripting (XSS) due to the improper input sanitization on the
"Additional HTML Section" via "Header and Footer" parameter in
/admin/settings.php. This vulnerability is leading an attacker to
steal admin and all user account cookies by storing the malicious XSS
payload in Header and Footer. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor
because the "Additional HTML Section" for "Header and Footer" can only
be supplied by an administrator, who is intentionally allowed to enter
unsanitized input (e.g., site-specific JavaScript).

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3. A kernel
pointer leak can be used to determine the address of the
iscsi_transport structure. When an iSCSI transport is registered with
the iSCSI subsystem, the transport's handle is available to
unprivileged users via the sysfs file system, at
/sys/class/iscsi_transport/$TRANSPORT_NAME/handle. When read, the
show_transport_handle function (in
drivers/scsi/scsi_transport_iscsi.c) is called, which leaks the
handle. This handle is actually the pointer to an iscsi_transport
struct in the kernel module's global variables.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20210414 CVE-2021-27850: Apache Tapestry: Bypass of the fix for CVE-2019-0195
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/15/1

A critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability was
found all recent versions of Apache Tapestry. The affected versions
include 5.4.5, 5.5.0, 5.6.2 and 5.7.0. The vulnerability I have found
is a bypass of the fix for CVE-2019-0195. Recap: Before the fix of
CVE-2019-0195 it was possible to download arbitrary class files from
the classpath by providing a crafted asset file URL. An attacker was
able to download the file `AppModule.class` by requesting the URL
`http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class`
which contains a HMAC secret key. The fix for that bug was a blacklist
filter that checks if the URL ends with `.class`, `.properties` or
`.xml`. Bypass: Unfortunately, the blacklist solution can simply be
bypassed by appending a `/` at the end of the URL:
`http://localhost:8080/assets/something/services/AppModule.class/` The
slash is stripped after the blacklist check and the file
`AppModule.class` is loaded into the response. This class usually
contains the HMAC secret key which is used to sign serialized Java
objects. With the knowledge of that key an attacker can sign a Java
gadget chain that leads to RCE (e.g. CommonsBeanUtils1 from
ysoserial). Solution for this vulnerability: * For Apache Tapestry
5.4.0 to 5.6.1, upgrade to 5.6.2 or later. * For Apache Tapestry
5.7.0, upgrade to 5.7.1 or later.

Reference: URL:https://guix.gnu.org/en/blog/2021/risk-of-local-privilege-escalation-via-guix-daemon/

A security vulnerability that can lead to local privilege escalation
has been found in &#8217;guix-daemon&#8217;. It affects multi-user setups in which
&#8217;guix-daemon&#8217; runs locally. The attack consists in having an
unprivileged user spawn a build process, for instance with `guix
build`, that makes its build directory world-writable. The user then
creates a hardlink to a root-owned file such as /etc/shadow in that
build directory. If the user passed the --keep-failed option and the
build eventually fails, the daemon changes ownership of the whole
build tree, including the hardlink, to the user. At that point, the
user has write access to the target file. Versions after and including
v0.11.0-3298-g2608e40988, and versions prior to
v1.2.0-75109-g94f0312546 are vulnerable.

The ReplicationHandler (normally registered at "/replication" under a
Solr core) in Apache Solr has a "masterUrl" (also "leaderUrl" alias)
parameter that is used to designate another ReplicationHandler on
another Solr core to replicate index data into the local core. To
prevent a SSRF vulnerability, Solr ought to check these parameters
against a similar configuration it uses for the "shards" parameter.
Prior to this bug getting fixed, it did not. This problem affects
essentially all Solr versions prior to it getting fixed in 8.8.2.

Apache Superset up to and including 0.38.0 allowed the creation of a
Markdown component on a Dashboard page for describing chart's related
information. Abusing this functionality, a malicious user could inject
javascript code executing unwanted action in the context of the user's
browser. The javascript code will be automatically executed (Stored
XSS) when a legitimate user surfs on the dashboard page. The
vulnerability is exploitable creating a &#8220;div&#8221; section and embedding in
it a &#8220;svg&#8221; element with javascript code.

In all versions prior to Mautic 3.3.2, secret parameters such as

For Mautic versions prior to 3.3.4/4.0.0, there is an XSS
vulnerability on Mautic's password reset page where a vulnerable
parameter, "bundle," in the URL could allow an attacker to execute
Javascript code. The attacker would be required to convince or trick
the target into clicking a password reset URL with the vulnerable
parameter utilized.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/mautic/mautic/security/advisories/GHSA-86pv-95mj-7w5f

Insufficient sanitization / filtering allows for arbitrary JavaScript
Injection in Mautic using the bounce management callback function. The
values submitted in the "error" and "error_related_to" parameters of
the POST request of the bounce management callback will be permanently
stored and executed once the details page of an affected lead is
opened by a Mautic user. An attacker with access to the bounce
management callback function (identified with the Mailjet webhook, but
it is assumed this will work uniformly across all kinds of webhooks)
can inject arbitrary JavaScript Code into the "error" and
"error_related_to" parameters of the POST request (POST
/mailer/<product / webhook>/callback). It is noted that there is no
authentication needed to access this function. The JavaScript Code is
stored permanently in the web application and executed every time an
authenticated user views the details page of a single contact / lead
in Mautic. This means, arbitrary code can be executed to, e.g., steal
or tamper with information.
