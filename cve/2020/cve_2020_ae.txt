Under certain circumstances a user's password may be logged in
cleartext in the PanGPS.log diagnostic file when logs are collected
for troubleshooting on GlobalProtect app (also known as GlobalProtect
Agent) for MacOS and Windows. For this issue to occur all of these
conditions must be true: (1) 'Save User Credential' option should be
set to 'Yes' in the GlobalProtect Portal's Agent configuration, (2)
the GlobalProtect user manually selects a gateway, (3) and the logging
level is set to 'Dump' while collecting troubleshooting logs. This
issue does not affect GlobalProtect app on other platforms (for
example iOS/Android/Linux). This issue affects GlobalProtect app 5.0
versions earlier than 5.0.9, GlobalProtect app 5.1 versions earlier
than 5.1.2 on Windows or MacOS. Since becoming aware of the issue,
Palo Alto Networks has safely deleted all the known GlobalProtectLogs
zip files sent by customers with the credentials. We now filter and
remove these credentials from all files sent to Customer Support. The
GlobalProtectLogs zip files uploaded to Palo Alto Networks systems
were only accessible by authorized personnel with valid Palo Alto
Networks credentials. We do not have any evidence of malicious access
or use of these credentials.

When Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication is
enabled and the 'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is
disabled (unchecked), improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS
SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker
to access protected resources. The attacker must have network access
to the vulnerable server to exploit this vulnerability. This issue
affects PAN-OS 9.1 versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.1.3; PAN-OS 9.0
versions earlier than PAN-OS 9.0.9; PAN-OS 8.1 versions earlier than
PAN-OS 8.1.15, and all versions of PAN-OS 8.0 (EOL). This issue does
not affect PAN-OS 7.1. This issue cannot be exploited if SAML is not
used for authentication. This issue cannot be exploited if the
'Validate Identity Provider Certificate' option is enabled (checked)
in the SAML Identity Provider Server Profile. Resources that can be
protected by SAML-based single sign-on (SSO) authentication are:
GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless
VPN, Authentication and Captive Portal, PAN-OS next-generation
firewalls (PA-Series, VM-Series) and Panorama web interfaces, Prisma
Access In the case of GlobalProtect Gateways, GlobalProtect Portal,
Clientless VPN, Captive Portal, and Prisma Access, an unauthenticated
attacker with network access to the affected servers can gain access
to protected resources if allowed by configured authentication and
Security policies. There is no impact on the integrity and
availability of the gateway, portal or VPN server. An attacker cannot
inspect or tamper with sessions of regular users. In the worst case,
this is a critical severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of
10.0 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:N). In the case of
PAN-OS and Panorama web interfaces, this issue allows an
unauthenticated attacker with network access to the PAN-OS or Panorama
web interfaces to log in as an administrator and perform
administrative actions. In the worst-case scenario, this is a critical
severity vulnerability with a CVSS Base Score of 10.0
(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). If the web interfaces
are only accessible to a restricted management network, then the issue
is lowered to a CVSS Base Score of 9.6
(CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H). Palo Alto Networks is
not aware of any malicious attempts to exploit this vulnerability.

When SSL/TLS Forward Proxy Decryption mode has been configured to
decrypt the web transactions, the PAN-OS URL filtering feature
inspects the HTTP Host and URL path headers for policy enforcement on
the decrypted HTTPS web transactions but does not consider Server Name
Indication (SNI) field within the TLS Client Hello handshake. This
allows a compromised host in a protected network to evade any security
policy that uses URL filtering on a firewall configured with SSL
Decryption in the Forward Proxy mode. A malicious actor can then use
this technique to evade detection of communication on the TLS
handshake phase between a compromised host and a remote malicious
server. This technique does not increase the risk of a host being
compromised in the network. It does not impact the confidentiality or
availability of a firewall. This is considered to have a low impact on
the integrity of the firewall because the firewall fails to enforce a
policy on certain traffic that should have been blocked. This issue
does not impact the URL filtering policy enforcement on clear text or
encrypted web transactions. This technique can be used only after a
malicious actor has compromised a host in the protected network and
the TLS/SSL Decryption feature is enabled for the traffic that the
attacker controls. Palo Alto Networks is not aware of any malware that
uses this technique to exfiltrate data. This issue is applicable to
all current versions of PAN-OS. This issue does not impact Panorama or
WF-500 appliances.

An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the GlobalProtect SSL
VPN component of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software that allows an
attacker to bypass all client certificate checks with an invalid

certificate verification are: GlobalProtect Gateway, GlobalProtect
Portal, GlobalProtect Clientless VPN In configurations where client
certificate verification is used in conjunction with other
authentication methods, the protections added by the certificate check
are ignored as a result of this issue. This issue impacts: PAN-OS 8.1

Inim Electronics SmartLiving SmartLAN/G/SI <=6.x suffers from an
authenticated remote command injection vulnerability. The issue exist
due to the 'par' POST parameter not being sanitized when called with
the 'testemail' module through web.cgi binary. The vulnerable CGI
binary (ELF 32-bit LSB executable, ARM) is calling the 'sh' executable
via the system() function to issue a command using the mailx service
and its vulnerable string format parameter allowing for OS command
injection with root privileges. An attacker can remotely execute
system commands as the root user using default credentials and bypass
access controls in place.
