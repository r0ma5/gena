In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
media: aspeed: fix clock handling logic Video engine uses eclk and
vclk for its clock sources and its reset control is coupled with eclk
so the current clock enabling sequence works like below. Enable eclk
De-assert Video Engine reset 10ms delay Enable vclk It introduces
improper reset on the Video Engine hardware and eventually the
hardware generates unexpected DMA memory transfers that can corrupt
memory region in random and sporadic patterns. This issue is observed
very rarely on some specific AST2500 SoCs but it causes a critical
kernel panic with making a various shape of signature so it's
extremely hard to debug. Moreover, the issue is observed even when the
video engine is not actively used because udevd turns on the video
engine hardware for a short time to make a query in every boot. To fix
this issue, this commit changes the clock handling logic to make the
reset de-assertion triggered after enabling both eclk and vclk. Also,
it adds clk_unprepare call for a case when probe fails. clk: ast2600:
fix reset settings for eclk and vclk Video engine reset setting should
be coupled with eclk to match it with the setting for previous Aspeed
SoCs which is defined in clk-aspeed.c since all Aspeed SoCs are
sharing a single video engine driver. Also, reset bit 6 is defined as
'Video Engine' reset in datasheet so it should be de-asserted when
eclk is enabled. This commit fixes the setting.

Reference: MISC:https://github.com/Nozbe/WatermelonDB/commit/924c7ae2a8d7d6459656751e5b9b1bf91a218025

In WatermelonDB (NPM package "@nozbe/watermelondb") before versions
0.15.1 and 0.16.2, a maliciously crafted record ID can exploit a SQL
Injection vulnerability in iOS adapter implementation and cause the
app to delete all or selected records from the database, generally
causing the app to become unusable. This may happen in apps that don't
validate IDs (valid IDs are `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_-.]+$/`) and use Watermelon
Sync or low-level `database.adapter.destroyDeletedRecords` method. The
integrity risk is low due to the fact that maliciously deleted records
won't synchronize, so logout-login will restore all data, although
some local changes may be lost if the malicious deletion causes the
sync process to fail to proceed to push stage. No way to breach
confidentiality with this vulnerability is known. Full exploitation of
SQL Injection is mitigated, because it's not possible to nest an
insert/update query inside a delete query in SQLite, and it's not
possible to pass a semicolon-separated second query. There's also no
known practicable way to breach confidentiality by selectively
deleting records, because those records will not be synchronized. It's
theoretically possible that selective record deletion could cause an
app to behave insecurely if lack of a record is used to make security
decisions by the app. This is patched in versions 0.15.1, 0.16.2, and
0.16.1-fix

factor should be regarded as very high. Newer phpMussel versions don't
use PHP's phar wrapper, and are therefore unaffected. This has been

The xrdp-sesman service before version 0.9.13.1 can be crashed by
connecting over port 3350 and supplying a malicious payload. Once the
xrdp-sesman process is dead, an unprivileged attacker on the server
could then proceed to start their own imposter sesman service
listening on port 3350. This will allow them to capture any user
credentials that are submitted to XRDP and approve or reject arbitrary
login credentials. For xorgxrdp sessions in particular, this allows an
unauthorized user to hijack an existing session. This is a buffer
overflow attack, so there may be a risk of arbitrary code execution as
well.

SSB-DB version 20.0.0 has an information disclosure vulnerability. The
get() method is supposed to only decrypt messages when you explicitly
ask it to, but there is a bug where it's decrypting any message that
it can. This means that it is returning the decrypted content of
private messages, which a malicious peer could use to get access to
private data. This only affects peers running SSB-DB@20.0.0 who also
have private messages, and is only known to be exploitable if you're
also running SSB-OOO (default in SSB-Server), which exposes a thin
wrapper around get() to anonymous peers. This is fixed in version
20.0.1. Note that users of SSB-Server verion 16.0.0 should upgrade to
16.0.1 to get the fixed version of SSB-DB.

In affected versions of WordPress, users with low privileges (like
contributors and authors) can use the embed block in a certain way to
inject unfiltered HTML in the block editor. When affected posts are
viewed by a higher privileged user, this could lead to script
execution in the editor/wp-admin. This has been patched in version
5.4.2, along with all the previously affected versions via a minor
release (5.3.4, 5.2.7, 5.1.6, 5.0.10, 4.9.15, 4.8.14, 4.7.18, 4.6.19,

In Wiki.js before 2.4.107, there is a stored cross-site scripting
through template injection. This vulnerability exists due to an
insecure validation mechanism intended to insert v-pre tags into
rendered HTML elements which contain curly-braces. By creating a
crafted wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-
site scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious
JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. This has been
patched in 2.4.107.

In Sanitize (RubyGem sanitize) greater than or equal to 3.0.0 and less
than 5.2.1, there is a cross-site scripting vulnerability. When HTML
is sanitized using Sanitize's "relaxed" config, or a custom config
that allows certain elements, some content in a math or svg element
may not be sanitized correctly even if math and svg are not in the
allowlist. You are likely to be vulnerable to this issue if you use
Sanitize's relaxed config or a custom config that allows one or more
of the following HTML elements: iframe, math, noembed, noframes,
noscript, plaintext, script, style, svg, xmp. Using carefully crafted
input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML through
Sanitize, potentially resulting in XSS (cross-site scripting) or other
undesired behavior when that HTML is rendered in a browser. This has
been fixed in 5.2.1.

This issue may lead to remote code execution if a client of the

In LoRa Basics Station before 2.0.4, there is a Use After Free
vulnerability that leads to memory corruption. This bug is triggered
on 32-bit machines when the CUPS server responds with a message
(https://doc.sm.tc/station/cupsproto.html#http-post-response) where
the signature length is larger than 2 GByte (never happens in
practice), or the response is crafted specifically to trigger this
issue (i.e. the length signature field indicates a value larger than
(2**31)-1 although the signature actually does not contain that much
data). In such a scenario, on 32 bit machines, Basic Station would
execute a code path, where a piece of memory is accessed after it has
been freed, causing the process to crash and restarted again. The CUPS
transaction is typically mutually authenticated over TLS. Therefore,
in order to trigger this vulnerability, the attacker would have to
gain access to the CUPS server first. If the user chose to operate
without authentication over TLS but yet is concerned about this
vulnerability, one possible workaround is to enable TLS
authentication. This has been fixed in 2.0.4.

In Conjur OSS Helm Chart before 2.0.0, a recently identified critical
vulnerability resulted in the installation of the Conjur Postgres
database with an open port. This allows an attacker to gain full read
& write access to the Conjur Postgres database, including escalating
the attacker's privileges to assume full control. A malicious actor
who knows the IP address and port number of the Postgres database and
has access into the Kubernetes cluster where Conjur runs can gain full
read & write access to the Postgres database. This enables the
attacker to write a policy that allows full access to retrieve any
secret. This Helm chart is a method to install Conjur OSS into a
Kubernetes environment. Hence, the systems impacted are only Conjur
OSS systems that were deployed using this chart. Other deployments
including Docker and the CyberArk Dynamic Access Provider (DAP) are
not affected. To remediate this vulnerability, clone the latest Helm
Chart and follow the upgrade instructions. If you are not able to
fully remediate this vulnerability immediately, you can mitigate some
of the risk by making sure Conjur OSS is deployed on an isolated
Kubernetes cluster or namespace. The term "isolated" refers to: - No
other workloads besides Conjur OSS and its backend database are
running in that Kubernetes cluster/namespace. - Kubernetes and helm
access to the cluster/namespace is limited to security administrators
via Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

In coturn before version 4.5.1.3, there is an issue whereby STUN/TURN
response buffer is not initialized properly. There is a leak of
information between different client connections. One client (an
attacker) could use their connection to intelligently query coturn to
get interesting bytes in the padding bytes from the connection of
another client. This has been fixed in 4.5.1.3.

In django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist before 0.3.4, a potential timing
attack exists on websites where the basic authentication is used or
configured, i.e. BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN and BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD is set.
Currently the string comparison between configured credentials and the
ones provided by users is performed through a character-by-character
string comparison. This enables a possibility that attacker may time
the time it takes the server to validate different usernames and
password, and use this knowledge to work out the valid credentials.
This attack is understood not to be realistic over the Internet.
However, it may be achieved from within local networks where the
website is hosted, e.g. from inside a data centre where a website's
server is located. Sites protected by IP address whitelisting only are
unaffected by this vulnerability. This vulnerability has been fixed on
version 0.3.4 of django-basic-auth-ip-whitelist. Update to version
0.3.4 as soon as possible and change basic authentication username and
password configured on a Django project using this package. A
workaround without upgrading to version 0.3.4 is to stop using basic
authentication and use the IP whitelisting component only. It can be
achieved by not setting BASIC_AUTH_LOGIN and BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD in
Django project settings.

Name: CVE-2020-5180
Status: Candidate
Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.sparklabs.com/blog/viscosity-for-mac-windows-version-1-8-4/

Viscosity 1.8.2 on Windows and macOS allows an unprivileged user to
set a subset of OpenVPN parameters, which can be used to load a
malicious library into the memory of the OpenVPN process, leading to
limited local privilege escalation. (When a VPN connection is
initiated using a TLS/SSL client profile, the privileges are dropped,
and the library will be loaded, resulting in arbitrary code execution
as a user with limited privileges. This greatly reduces the impact of
the vulnerability.)

apt-cacher-ng through 3.3 allows local users to obtain sensitive
information by hijacking the hardcoded TCP port. The /usr/lib/apt-
cacher-ng/acngtool program attempts to connect to apt-cacher-ng via
TCP on localhost port 3142, even if the explicit
SocketPath=/var/run/apt-cacher-ng/socket command-line option is
passed. The cron job /etc/cron.daily/apt-cacher-ng (which is active by
default) attempts this periodically. Because 3142 is an unprivileged
port, any local user can try to bind to this port and will receive
requests from acngtool. There can be sensitive data in these requests,
e.g., if AdminAuth is enabled in /etc/apt-cacher-ng/security.conf.
This sensitive data can leak to unprivileged local users that manage
to bind to this port before the apt-cacher-ng daemon can.

In TensorFlow before 1.15.2 and 2.0.1, converting a string (from
Python) to a tf.float16 value results in a segmentation fault in eager
mode as the format checks for this use case are only in the graph
mode. This issue can lead to denial of service in inference/training
where a malicious attacker can send a data point which contains a
string instead of a tf.float16 value. Similar effects can be obtained
by manipulating saved models and checkpoints whereby replacing a
scalar tf.float16 value with a scalar string will trigger this issue
due to automatic conversions. This can be easily reproduced by
tf.constant("hello", tf.float16), if eager execution is enabled. This
issue is patched in TensorFlow 1.15.1 and 2.0.1 with this
vulnerability patched. TensorFlow 2.1.0 was released after we fixed
the issue, thus it is not affected. Users are encouraged to switch to
TensorFlow 1.15.1, 2.0.1 or 2.1.0.

In Secure Headers (RubyGem secure_headers), a directive injection

If user-supplied input was passed into

injected leading to limited header injection. Upon seeing a newline in
the header, rails will silently create a new Content-Security-Policy
header with the remaining value of the original string. It will

In Secure Headers (RubyGem secure_headers), a directive injection
vulnerability is present in versions before 3.8.0, 5.1.0, and 6.2.0.
If user-supplied input was passed into
append/override_content_security_policy_directives, a semicolon could
be injected leading to directive injection. This could be used to e.g.
override a script-src directive. Duplicate directives are ignored and
the first one wins. The directives in secure_headers are sorted
alphabetically so they pretty much all come before script-src. A
previously undefined directive would receive a value even if
SecureHeaders::OPT_OUT was supplied. The fixed versions will silently
convert the semicolons to spaces and emit a deprecation warning when
this happens. This will result in innocuous browser console messages
if being exploited/accidentally used. In future releases, we will
raise application errors resulting in 500s. Depending on what major
version you are using, the fixed versions are 6.2.0, 5.1.0, 3.8.0.

Sylius ResourceBundle accepts and uses any serialisation groups to be
passed via a HTTP header. This might lead to data exposure by using an
unintended serialisation group - for example it could make Shop API
use a more permissive group from Admin API. Anyone exposing an API
with ResourceBundle's controller is affected. The vulnerable versions
are: <1.3 || >=1.3.0 <=1.3.12 || >=1.4.0 <=1.4.5 || >=1.5.0 <=1.5.0 ||
>=1.6.0 <=1.6.2. The patch is provided for Sylius ResourceBundle
1.3.13, 1.4.6, 1.5.1 and 1.6.3, but not for any versions below 1.3.

In uftpd before 2.11, it is possible for an unauthenticated user to
perform a directory traversal attack using multiple different FTP
commands and read and write to arbitrary locations on the filesystem
due to the lack of a well-written chroot jail in compose_abspath().

Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1 enables a remember-me cookie based on a
hash created from the username, password, and an additional system
key. This means that an attacker getting access to a remember-me token
for one server can get access to all servers which allow log-in using
the same credentials without ever needing the credentials. This
problem is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and Opencast 8.1

In PrivateBin versions 1.2.0 before 1.2.2, and 1.3.0 before 1.3.2, a
persistent XSS attack is possible. Under certain conditions, a user
provided attachment file name can inject HTML leading to a persistent

Log injection in SimpleSAMLphp before version 1.18.4. The
www/erroreport.php script, which receives error reports and sends them
via email to the system administrator, did not properly sanitize the
report identifier obtained from the request. This allows an attacker,
under specific circumstances, to inject new log lines by manually
crafting this report ID. When configured to use the file logging
handler, SimpleSAMLphp will output all its logs by appending each log
line to a given file. Since the reportID parameter received in a
request sent to www/errorreport.php was not properly sanitized, it was
possible to inject newline characters into it, effectively allowing a
malicious user to inject new log lines with arbitrary content.

Cross-site scripting in SimpleSAMLphp before version 1.18.4. The
www/erroreport.php script allows error reports to be submitted and
sent to the system administrator. Starting with SimpleSAMLphp 1.18.0,
a new SimpleSAML\Utils\EMail class was introduced to handle sending
emails, implemented as a wrapper of an external dependency. This new
wrapper allows us to use Twig templates in order to create the email
sent with an error report. Since Twig provides automatic escaping of
variables, manual escaping of the free-text field in
www/errorreport.php was removed to avoid double escaping. However, for
those not using the new user interface yet, an email template is
hardcoded into the class itself in plain PHP. Since no escaping is
provided in this template, it is then possible to inject HTML inside
the template by manually crafting the contents of the free-text field.

Feedgen (python feedgen) before 0.9.0 is susceptible to XML Denial of
Service attacks. The *feedgen* library allows supplying XML as content
for some of the available fields. This XML will be parsed and
integrated into the existing XML tree. During this process, feedgen is
vulnerable to XML Denial of Service Attacks (e.g. XML Bomb). This
becomes a concern in particular if feedgen is used to include content
from untrused sources and if XML (including XHTML) is directly
included instead of providing plain tex content only. This problem has
been fixed in feedgen 0.9.0 which disallows XML entity expansion and
external resources.

Opencast before 8.1 and 7.6 allows unauthorized public access to all
media and metadata by default via OAI-PMH. OAI-PMH is part of the
default workflow and is activated by default, requiring active user
intervention of users to protect media. This leads to users
unknowingly handing out public access to events without their
knowledge. The problem has been addressed in Opencast 7.6 and 8.1
where the OAI-PMH endpoint is configured to require users with
`ROLE_ADMIN` by default. In addition to this, Opencast 9 removes the
OAI-PMH publication from the default workflow, making the publication
a conscious decision users have to make by updating their workflows.

Opencast before 8.1 stores passwords using the rather outdated and
cryptographically insecure MD5 hash algorithm. Furthermore, the hashes
are salted using the username instead of a random salt, causing hashes
for users with the same username and password to collide which is
problematic especially for popular users like the default `admin`
user. This essentially means that for an attacker, it might be
feasible to reconstruct a user's password given access to these
hashes. Note that attackers needing access to the hashes means that
they must gain access to the database in which these are stored first
to be able to start cracking the passwords. The problem is addressed
in Opencast 8.1 which now uses the modern and much stronger bcrypt
password hashing algorithm for storing passwords. Note, that old
hashes remain MD5 until the password is updated. For a list of users
whose password hashes are stored using MD5, take a look at the `/user-
utils/users/md5.json` REST endpoint.

Opencast before 8.1 and 7.6 allows almost arbitrary identifiers for
media packages and elements to be used. This can be problematic for
operation and security since such identifiers are sometimes used for
file system operations which may lead to an attacker being able to
escape working directories and write files to other locations. In
addition, Opencast's Id.toString(&#8230;) vs Id.compact(&#8230;) behavior, the
latter trying to mitigate some of the file system problems, can cause
errors due to identifier mismatch since an identifier may
unintentionally change. This issue is fixed in Opencast 7.6 and 8.1.

In Opencast before 7.6 and 8.1, users with the role ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN
can use the user-utils endpoint to create new users not including the
role ROLE_ADMIN. ROLE_COURSE_ADMIN is a non-standard role in Opencast
which is referenced neither in the documentation nor in any code
(except for tests) but only in the security configuration. From the
name &#8211; implying an admin for a specific course &#8211; users would never
expect that this role allows user creation. This issue is fixed in 7.6

Waitress version 1.4.2 allows a DOS attack When waitress receives a
header that contains invalid characters. When a header like "Bad-
header: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\x10" is received, it will cause the regular
expression engine to catastrophically backtrack causing the process to
use 100% CPU time and blocking any other interactions. This allows an
attacker to send a single request with an invalid header and take the
service offline. This issue was introduced in version 1.4.2 when the
regular expression was updated to attempt to match the behaviour
required by errata associated with RFC7230. The regular expression
that is used to validate incoming headers has been updated in version
1.4.3, it is recommended that people upgrade to the new version of
Waitress as soon as possible.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00034.html

In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.2 and before 3.12.3, if an application
using Puma allows untrusted input in a response header, an attacker
can use newline characters (i.e. `CR`, `LF` or`/r`, `/n`) to end the
header and inject malicious content, such as additional headers or an
entirely new response body. This vulnerability is known as HTTP
Response Splitting. While not an attack in itself, response splitting
is a vector for several other attacks, such as cross-site scripting
(XSS). This is related to CVE-2019-16254, which fixed this
vulnerability for the WEBrick Ruby web server. This has been fixed in
versions 4.3.2 and 3.12.3 by checking all headers for line endings and
rejecting headers with those characters.

GLPI before before version 9.4.6 has a vulnerability involving a
default encryption key. GLPIKEY is public and is used on every
instance. This means anyone can decrypt sensitive data stored using
this key. It is possible to change the key before installing GLPI. But
on existing instances, data must be reencrypted with the new key.
Problem is we can not know which columns or rows in the database are
using that; espcially from plugins. Changing the key without updating
data would lend in bad password sent from glpi; but storing them again
from the UI will work.

Reference: CONFIRM:https://pyup.io/posts/patched-vulnerability/

The command-line "safety" package for Python has a potential security
issue. There are two Python characteristics that allow malicious code
to &#8220;poison-pill&#8221; command-line Safety package detection routines by
disguising, or obfuscating, other malicious or non-secure packages.
This vulnerability is considered to be of low severity because the
attack makes use of an existing Python condition, not the Safety tool
itself. This can happen if: You are running Safety in a Python
environment that you don&#8217;t trust. You are running Safety from the same
Python environment where you have your dependencies installed.
Dependency packages are being installed arbitrarily or without proper
verification. Users can mitigate this issue by doing any of the
following: Perform a static analysis by installing Docker and running
the Safety Docker image: $ docker run --rm -it pyupio/safety check -r
requirements.txt Run Safety against a static dependencies list, such
as the requirements.txt file, in a separate, clean Python environment.
Run Safety from a Continuous Integration pipeline. Use PyUp.io, which
runs Safety in a controlled environment and checks Python for
dependencies without any need to install them. Use PyUp's Online
Requirements Checker.

Reference: MISC:https://symfony.com/blog/cve-2020-5255-prevent-cache-poisoning-via-a-response-content-type-header

In Symfony before versions 4.4.7 and 5.0.7, when a `Response` does not
contain a `Content-Type` header, affected versions of Symfony can
fallback to the format defined in the `Accept` header of the request,
leading to a possible mismatch between the response&#39;s content and
`Content-Type` header. When the response is cached, this can prevent
the use of the website by other users. This has been patched in
versions 4.4.7 and 5.0.7.

BookStack before version 0.25.5 has a vulnerability where a user could
upload PHP files through image upload functions, which would allow
them to execute code on the host system remotely. They would then have
the permissions of the PHP process. This most impacts scenarios where
non-trusted users are given permission to upload images in any area of
the application. The issue was addressed in a series of patches in
versions 0.25.3, 0.25.4 and 0.25.5. Users should upgrade to at least
v0.25.5 to avoid this vulnerability.

Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be
tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an
attacker. Git uses external "credential helper" programs to store and
retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided
by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that contain an
encoded newline can inject unintended values into the credential
helper protocol stream, causing the credential helper to retrieve the
password for one server (e.g., good.example.com) for an HTTP request
being made to another server (e.g., evil.example.com), resulting in
credentials for the former being sent to the latter. There are no
restrictions on the relationship between the two, meaning that an
attacker can craft a URL that will present stored credentials for any
host to a host of their choosing. The vulnerability can be triggered
by feeding a malicious URL to git clone. However, the affected URLs
look rather suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems
which automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git
submodules, or package systems built around Git. The problem has been
patched in the versions published on April 14th, 2020, going back to
v2.17.x. Anyone wishing to backport the change further can do so by
applying commit 9a6bbee (the full release includes extra checks for
git fsck, but that commit is sufficient to protect clients against the
vulnerability). The patched versions are: 2.17.4, 2.18.3, 2.19.4,
2.20.3, 2.21.2, 2.22.3, 2.23.2, 2.24.2, 2.25.3, 2.26.1.

In Saml2 Authentication Services for ASP.NET versions before 1.0.2,
and between 2.0.0 and 2.6.0, there is a vulnerability in how tokens
are validated in some cases. Saml2 tokens are usually used as bearer
tokens - a caller that presents a token is assumed to be the subject
of the token. There is also support in the Saml2 protocol for issuing
tokens that is tied to a subject through other means, e.g. holder-of-
key where possession of a private key must be proved. The
Sustainsys.Saml2 library incorrectly treats all incoming tokens as
bearer tokens, even though they have another subject confirmation
method specified. This could be used by an attacker that could get
access to Saml2 tokens with another subject confirmation method than
bearer. The attacker could then use such a token to create a log in
session. This vulnerability is patched in versions 1.0.2 and 2.7.0.

might sound harmless at first, the impacts of it can be severe should
it be exploitable. The problem is fixed in 1.7.6.5

ViewVC before versions 1.1.28 and 1.2.1 has a XSS vulnerability in CVS
show_subdir_lastmod support. The impact of this vulnerability is
mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a
CVS repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance that
also has the `show_subdir_lastmod` feature enabled. The attack vector
involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded into an
HTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code), which
themselves can be challenging to create. This vulnerability is patched
in versions 1.2.1 and 1.1.28.

Bubblewrap (bwrap) before version 0.4.1, if installed in setuid mode
and the kernel supports unprivileged user namespaces, then the `bwrap

permissions. Note that this only affects the combination of bubblewrap
in setuid mode (which is typically used when unprivileged user
namespaces are not supported) and the support of unprivileged user
namespaces. Known to be affected are: * Debian testing/unstable, if
unprivileged user namespaces enabled (not default) * Debian buster-

Arch if using `linux-hardened`, if unprivileged user namespaces
enabled (not default) * Centos 7 flatpak COPR, if unprivileged user

into the data to cause the generated CSV export file to be malicious.
This requires attackers to achieve the following before a successful
attack can be completed: 1. Have found a vulnerability in the victims
spreadsheet software of choice. 2. Control data that would potentially
be exported through the `ImportExportController` by a theoretical
victim. 3. Convince the victim to export above data as a CSV and run
it in vulnerable spreadsheet software while also bypassing any sanity
checks by said software. Issue has been patched in Build 466
(v1.0.466).

Reference: MISC:https://github.com/ory/hydra/releases/tag/v1.4.0

In Hydra (an OAuth2 Server and OpenID Certified&#8482; OpenID Connect
Provider written in Go), before version 1.4.0+oryOS.17, when using
client authentication method 'private_key_jwt' [1], OpenId
specification says the following about assertion `jti`: "A unique
identifier for the token, which can be used to prevent reuse of the
token. These tokens MUST only be used once, unless conditions for
reuse were negotiated between the parties". Hydra does not check the
uniqueness of this `jti` value. Exploiting this vulnerability is
somewhat difficult because: - TLS protects against MITM which makes it
difficult to intercept valid tokens for replay attacks - The expiry
time of the JWT gives only a short window of opportunity where it
could be replayed This has been patched in version v1.4.0+oryOS.17

SimpleSAMLphp versions before 1.18.6 contain an information disclosure
vulnerability. The module controller in `SimpleSAML\Module` that
processes requests for pages hosted by modules, has code to identify
paths ending with `.php` and process those as PHP code. If no other
suitable way of handling the given path exists it presents the file to
the browser. The check to identify paths ending with `.php` does not
account for uppercase letters. If someone requests a path ending with
e.g. `.PHP` and the server is serving the code from a case-insensitive
file system, such as on Windows, the processing of the PHP code does
not occur, and the source code is instead presented to the browser. An
attacker may use this issue to gain access to the source code in
third-party modules that is meant to be private, or even sensitive.
However, the attack surface is considered small, as the attack will
only work when SimpleSAMLphp serves such content from a file system
that is not case-sensitive, such as on Windows. This issue is fixed in
version 1.18.6.

Tendermint before versions 0.33.3, 0.32.10, and 0.31.12 has a denial-
of-service vulnerability. Tendermint does not limit the number of P2P
connection requests. For each p2p connection, it allocates XXX bytes.
Even though this memory is garbage collected once the connection is
terminated (due to duplicate IP or reaching a maximum number of
inbound peers), temporary memory spikes can lead to OOM (Out-Of-
Memory) exceptions. Additionally, Tendermint does not reclaim activeID
of a peer after it's removed in Mempool reactor. This does not happen
all the time. It only happens when a connection fails (for any reason)
before the Peer is created and added to all reactors. RemovePeer is
therefore called before AddPeer, which leads to always growing memory
(activeIDs map). The activeIDs map has a maximum size of 65535 and the
node will panic if this map reaches the maximum. An attacker can
create a lot of connection attempts (exploiting above denial of
service), which ultimately will lead to the node panicking. These
issues are patched in Tendermint 0.33.3 and 0.32.10.

Spring Framework, versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.3 are vulnerable to CSRF
attacks through CORS preflight requests that target Spring MVC
(spring-webmvc module) or Spring WebFlux (spring-webflux module)
endpoints. Only non-authenticated endpoints are vulnerable because
preflight requests should not include credentials and therefore
requests should fail authentication. However a notable exception to
this are Chrome based browsers when using client certificates for
authentication since Chrome sends TLS client certificates in CORS
preflight requests in violation of spec requirements. No HTTP body can
be sent or received as a result of this attack.

When configured to enable default typing, Jackson contained a
deserialization vulnerability that could lead to arbitrary code
execution. Jackson fixed this vulnerability by blacklisting known
"deserialization gadgets". Spring Batch configures Jackson with global
default typing enabled which means that through the previous exploit,
arbitrary code could be executed if all of the following is true: *
Spring Batch's Jackson support is being leveraged to serialize a job's
ExecutionContext. * A malicious user gains write access to the data
store used by the JobRepository (where the data to be deserialized is
stored). In order to protect against this type of attack, Jackson
prevents a set of untrusted gadget classes from being deserialized.
Spring Batch should be proactive against blocking unknown
"deserialization gadgets" when enabling default typing.

Spring Integration framework provides Kryo Codec implementations as an
alternative for Java (de)serialization. When Kryo is configured with
default options, all unregistered classes are resolved on demand. This
leads to the "deserialization gadgets" exploit when provided data
contains malicious code for execution during deserialization. In order
to protect against this type of attack, Kryo can be configured to
require a set of trusted classes for (de)serialization. Spring
Integration should be proactive against blocking unknown
"deserialization gadgets" when configuring Kryo in code.

VMware Tanzu Application Service for VMs (2.7.x versions prior to
2.7.19, 2.8.x versions prior to 2.8.13, and 2.9.x versions prior to
2.9.7) contains an App Autoscaler that logs the UAA admin password.
This credential is redacted on VMware Tanzu Operations Manager;
however, the unredacted logs are available to authenticated users of
the BOSH Director. This credential would grant administrative
privileges to a malicious user. The same versions of App Autoscaler
also log the App Autoscaler Broker password. Prior to newer versions
of Operations Manager, this credential was not redacted from logs.
This credential allows a malicious user to create, delete, and modify
App Autoscaler services instances. Operations Manager started
redacting this credential from logs as of its versions 2.7.15, 2.8.6,
and 2.9.1. Note that these logs are typically only visible to
foundation administrators and operators.

An exploitable signed comparison vulnerability exists in the ARMv7
memcpy() implementation of GNU glibc 2.30.9000. Calling memcpy() (on
ARMv7 targets that utilize the GNU glibc implementation) with a
negative value for the 'num' parameter results in a signed comparison
vulnerability. If an attacker underflows the 'num' parameter to
memcpy(), this vulnerability could lead to undefined behavior such as
writing to out-of-bounds memory and potentially remote code execution.
Furthermore, this memcpy() implementation allows for program execution
to continue in scenarios where a segmentation fault or crash should
have occurred. The dangers occur in that subsequent execution and
iterations of this code will be executed with this corrupted data.

An exploitable code execution vulnerability exists in the JPEG2000
Stripe Decoding functionality of Nitro Software, Inc.&#8217;s Nitro Pro
13.13.2.242 when decoding sub-samples. While initializing tiles with
sub-sample data, the application can miscalculate a pointer for the
stripes in the tile which allow for the decoder to write out of-bounds
and cause memory corruption. This can result in code execution. A
specially crafted image can be embedded inside a PDF and loaded by a
victim in order to trigger this vulnerability.

An exploitable vulnerability exists in the object stream parsing
functionality of Nitro Software, Inc.&#8217;s Nitro Pro 13.13.2.242 when
updating its cross-reference table. When processing an object stream
from a PDF document, the application will perform a calculation in
order to allocate memory for the list of indirect objects. Due to an
error when calculating this size, an integer overflow may occur which
can result in an undersized buffer being allocated. Later when
initializing this buffer, the application can write outside its bounds
which can cause a memory corruption that can lead to code execution. A
specially crafted document can be delivered to a victim in order to
trigger this vulnerability.

An exploitable vulnerability exists in the cross-reference table
repairing functionality of Nitro Software, Inc.&#8217;s Nitro Pro
13.13.2.242. While searching for an object identifier in a malformed
document that is missing from the cross-reference table, the
application will save a reference to the object&#8217;s cross-reference
table entry inside a stack variable. If the referenced object
identifier is not found, the application may resize the cross-
reference table which can change the scope of its entry. Later when
the application tries to reference cross-reference entry via the stack
variable, the application will access memory belonging to the recently
freed table causing a use-after-free condition. A specially crafted
document can be delivered by an attacker and loaded by a victim in
order to trigger this vulnerability.

Name: CVE-2020-6164
Status: Candidate
Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2020-6164

In SilverStripe through 4.5.0, a specific URL path configured by
default through the silverstripe/framework module can be used to
disclose the fact that a domain is hosting a Silverstripe application.
There is no disclosure of the specific version. The functionality on
this URL path is limited to execution in a CLI context, and is not
known to present a vulnerability through web-based access. As a side-
effect, this preconfigured path also blocks the creation of other
resources on this path (e.g. a page).

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-6165
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2020-6165

SilverStripe 4.5.0 allows attackers to read certain records that
should not have been placed into a result set. This affects
silverstripe/recipe-cms. The automatic permission-checking mechanism
in the silverstripe/graphql module does not provide complete
protection against lists that are limited (e.g., through pagination),
resulting in records that should have failed a permission check being
added to the final result set. GraphQL endpoints are configured by
default (e.g., for assets), but the admin/graphql endpoint is access
protected by default. This limits the vulnerability to all
authenticated users, including those with limited permissions (e.g.,
where viewing records exposed through admin/graphql requires
administrator permissions). However, if custom GraphQL endpoints have
been configured for a specific implementation (usually under
/graphql), this vulnerability could also be exploited through
unauthenticated requests. This vulnerability only applies to reading
records; it does not allow unauthorised changing of records.
