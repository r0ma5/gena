An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when an attacker
establishes a vulnerable Netlogon secure channel connection to a
domain controller, using the Netlogon Remote Protocol (MS-NRPC). An
attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run a
specially crafted application on a device on the network. To exploit
the vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker would be required to
use MS-NRPC to connect to a domain controller to obtain domain
administrator access. Microsoft is addressing the vulnerability in a
phased two-part rollout. These updates address the vulnerability by
modifying how Netlogon handles the usage of Netlogon secure channels.
For guidelines on how to manage the changes required for this
vulnerability and more information on the phased rollout, see How to
manage the changes in Netlogon secure channel connections associated
with CVE-2020-1472 (updated September 28, 2020). When the second phase
of Windows updates become available in Q1 2021, customers will be
notified via a revision to this security vulnerability. If you wish to
be notified when these updates are released, we recommend that you
register for the security notifications mailer to be alerted of
content changes to this advisory. See Microsoft Technical Security

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when DirectX improperly
handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this
vulnerability could run arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker
could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create
new accounts with full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker would first have to log on to the system. An attacker could
then run a specially crafted application that could exploit the
vulnerability and take control of an affected system. The update
addresses the vulnerability by correcting how DirectX handles objects
in memory.

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the
Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handles objects in memory. An
attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would
first have to log on to the system. An attacker could then run a
specially crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability and
take control of an affected system. The update addresses the
vulnerability by correcting how GDI handles objects in memory and by
preventing instances of unintended user-mode privilege elevation.

<p>A cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists when Microsoft
SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web
request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker
could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request
to an affected SharePoint server.</p> <p>The attacker who successfully
exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting
attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of
the current user. The attacks could allow the attacker to read content
that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity
to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as
change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in
the browser of the user.</p> <p>The security update addresses the
vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly
sanitizes web requests.</p>

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Outlook when
the software fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker
who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code
in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on
with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the
affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the
system could be less impacted than users who operate with
administrative user rights. Exploitation of the vulnerability requires
that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of
Microsoft Outlook software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker
could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file
to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based
attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or leverage a
compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that
contains a specially crafted file designed to exploit the
vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit
the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to
click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant
message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.
Note that where severity is indicated as Critical in the Affected
Products table, the Preview Pane is an attack vector. The security
update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Outlook handles
objects in memory.

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Media Foundation
improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully
exploited this vulnerability could obtain information to further
compromise the user&#8217;s system. To exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker would have to log onto an affected system and open a
specially crafted file. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker
could host a website (or leverage a compromised website that accepts
or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially crafted file
that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However, an attacker
would have no way to force the user to visit the website. Instead, an
attacker would have to convince the user to click a link, typically by
way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger message, and
then convince the user to open the specially crafted file. The update
addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Media Foundation handles
objects in memory.

Reference: URL:https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1493

An information disclosure vulnerability exists when attaching files to
Outlook messages. This vulnerability could potentially allow users to
share attached files such that they are accessible by anonymous users
where they should be restricted to specific users. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker would have to attach a file as a link to an
email. The email could then be shared with individuals that should not
have access to the files, ignoring the default organizational setting.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how
Outlook handles file attachment links.

Buffer overflows were discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the
SNMP agent. The function parsing the received SNMP request does not
verify the input message's requested variables against the capacity of
the internal SNMP engine buffer. If the number of variables in the
request exceeds the allocated buffer, a memory write out of the buffer
boundaries occurs. This write operation provides a possibility to
overwrite other variables allocated in the .bss section by the
application. Because the sender of the frame is in control of the
content that will be written beyond the buffer limits, and there is no
strict process memory separation, this issue may allow overwriting of
sensitive memory areas of an IoT device.

Buffer overflows were discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the
SNMP bulk get request response encoding function. The function parsing
the received SNMP request does not verify the input message's
requested variables against the capacity of the internal SNMP engine
buffer. When a bulk get request response is assembled, a stack buffer
dedicated for OIDs (with a limited capacity) is allocated in
snmp_engine_get_bulk(). When snmp_engine_get_bulk() is populating the
stack buffer, an overflow condition may occur due to lack of input
length validation. This makes it possible to overwrite stack regions
beyond the allocated buffer, including the return address from the
function. As a result, the code execution path may be redirected to an
address provided in the SNMP bulk get payload. If the target
architecture uses common addressing space for program and data memory,
it may also be possible to supply code in the SNMP request payload,
and redirect the execution path to the remotely injected code, by
modifying the function's return address.

Buffer overflows were discovered in Contiki-NG 4.4 through 4.5, in the
SNMP agent. Functions parsing the OIDs in SNMP requests lack
sufficient allocated target-buffer capacity verification when writing
parsed OID values. The function snmp_oid_decode_oid() may overwrite
memory areas beyond the provided target buffer, when called from
snmp_message_decode() upon an SNMP request reception. Because the
content of the write operations is externally provided in the SNMP
requests, it enables a remote overwrite of an IoT device's memory
regions beyond the allocated buffer. This overflow may allow remote
overwrite of stack and statically allocated variables memory regions
by sending a crafted SNMP request.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel
software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user
is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take
control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer
user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who
operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of the
vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with
an affected version of Microsoft Excel. In an email attack scenario,
an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially
crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In
a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or
leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided
content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the
vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit
the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to
click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant
message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how
Microsoft Excel handles objects in memory.

An issue was discovered in the jsrsasign package before 8.0.18 for
Node.js. Its RSA PKCS1 v1.5 decryption implementation does not detect
ciphertext modification by prepending '\0' bytes to ciphertexts (it
decrypts modified ciphertexts without error). An attacker might
prepend these bytes with the goal of triggering memory corruption
issues.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel
software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user
is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take
control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer
user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who
operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of the
vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with
an affected version of Microsoft Excel. In an email attack scenario,
an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially
crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In
a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or
leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided
content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the
vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit
the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to
click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant
message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how
Microsoft Excel handles objects in memory.

Reference: URL:https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1504

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel
software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user
is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take
control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer
user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who
operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of the
vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with
an affected version of Microsoft Excel. In an email attack scenario,
an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially
crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In
a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or
leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided
content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the
vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit
the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to
click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant
message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted file.
The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how
Microsoft Excel handles objects in memory.

<p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the way that the
Wininit.dll handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully
exploited the vulnerability could execute code with elevated
permissions.</p> <p>There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit
the vulnerability:</p> <ul> <li><p>In a web-based attack scenario, an
attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to
exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the
website. An attacker would have no way to force users to view the
attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to
convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a
link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes
users to the attacker's website, or by opening an attachment sent
through email.</p> </li> <li><p>In a file sharing attack scenario, an
attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is
designed to exploit this vulnerability, and then convince a user to
open the document file.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The security update
addresses the vulnerability by ensuring the Wininit.dll properly
handles objects in memory.</p>

malicious inside attacker, if the access of a trusted user is
compromised, or if they grant public write access to the document.
Some TimelineJS users configure their timeline with a JSON document.
Those users are exposed to this vulnerability if they grant write
access to the document to a malicious inside attacker, if the access
of a trusted user is compromised, or if write access to the system
hosting that document is otherwise compromised. Version 3.7.0 of
TimelineJS addresses this in two ways. For content which is intended
to support limited HTML markup for styling and linking, that content
is "sanitized" before being added to the DOM. For content intended for
simple text display, all markup is stripped. Very few users of
TimelineJS actually install the TimelineJS code on their server. Most
users publish a timeline using a URL hosted on systems we control. The
fix for this issue is published to our system such that **those users
will automatically begin using the new code**. The only exception
would be users who have deliberately edited the embed URL to "pin"
their timeline to an earlier version of the code. Some users of
TimelineJS use it as a part of a wordpress plugin (knight-lab-
timelinejs). Version 3.7.0.0 of that plugin and newer integrate the
updated code. Users are encouraged to update the plugin rather than
manually update the embedded version of TimelineJS.

The tough library (Rust/crates.io) prior to version 0.7.1 does not
properly verify the threshold of cryptographic signatures. It allows
an attacker to duplicate a valid signature in order to circumvent TUF
requiring a minimum threshold of unique signatures before the metadata
is considered valid. A fix is available in version 0.7.1.
CVE-2020-6174 is assigned to the same vulnerability in the TUF

In Symfony before versions 4.4.13 and 5.1.5, the CachingHttpClient
class from the HttpClient Symfony component relies on the HttpCache
class to handle requests. HttpCache uses internal headers like X-Body-
Eval and X-Body-File to control the restoration of cached responses.
The class was initially written with surrogate caching and ESI support
in mind (all HTTP calls come from a trusted backend in that scenario).
But when used by CachingHttpClient and if an attacker can control the
response for a request being made by the CachingHttpClient, remote
code execution is possible. This has been fixed in versions 4.4.13 and
5.1.5.

loklak is an open-source server application which is able to collect
messages from various sources, including twitter. The server contains
a search index and a peer-to-peer index sharing interface. All
messages are stored in an elasticsearch index. In loklak less than or
equal to commit 5f48476, a path traversal vulnerability exists.
Insufficient input validation in the APIs exposed by the loklak server
allowed a directory traversal vulnerability. Any admin configuration
and files readable by the app available on the hosted file system can
be retrieved by the attacker. Furthermore, user-controlled content
could be written to any admin config and files readable by the
application. This has been patched in commit 50dd692. Users will need
to upgrade their hosted instances of loklak to not be vulnerable to
this exploit.

In TYPO3 CMS greater than or equal to 9.0.0 and less than 9.5.20, and
greater than or equal to 10.0.0 and less than 10.4.6, it has been
discovered that an internal verification mechanism can be used to
generate arbitrary checksums. This allows to inject arbitrary data
having a valid cryptographic message authentication code (HMAC-SHA1)
and can lead to various attack chains including potential privilege
escalation, insecure deserialization & remote code execution. The
overall severity of this vulnerability is high based on mentioned
attack chains and the requirement of having a valid backend user
session (authenticated). This has been patched in versions 9.5.20 and

In Envoy before versions 1.12.6, 1.13.4, 1.14.4, and 1.15.0 when
validating TLS certificates, Envoy would incorrectly allow a wildcard
DNS Subject Alternative Name apply to multiple subdomains. For
example, with a SAN of *.example.com, Envoy would incorrectly allow
nested.subdomain.example.com, when it should only allow
subdomain.example.com. This defect applies to both validating a client
TLS certificate in mTLS, and validating a server TLS certificate for
upstream connections. This vulnerability is only applicable to
situations where an untrusted entity can obtain a signed wildcard TLS
certificate for a domain of which you only intend to trust a subdomain
of. For example, if you intend to trust api.mysubdomain.example.com,
and an untrusted actor can obtain a signed TLS certificate for
*.example.com or *.com. Configurations are vulnerable if they use
verify_subject_alt_name in any Envoy version, or if they use
match_subject_alt_names in version 1.14 or later. This issue has been

Django Two-Factor Authentication before 1.12, stores the user's
password in clear text in the user session (base64-encoded). The
password is stored in the session when the user submits their username
and password, and is removed once they complete authentication by
entering a two-factor authentication code. This means that the
password is stored in clear text in the session for an arbitrary
amount of time, and potentially forever if the user begins the login
process by entering their username and password and then leaves before
entering their two-factor authentication code. The severity of this
issue depends on which type of session storage you have configured: in
the worst case, if you're using Django's default database session
storage, then users' passwords are stored in clear text in your
database. In the best case, if you're using Django's signed cookie
session, then users' passwords are only stored in clear text within
their browser's cookie store. In the common case of using Django's
cache session store, the users' passwords are stored in clear text in
whatever cache storage you have configured (typically Memcached or
Redis). This has been fixed in 1.12. After upgrading, users should be
sure to delete any clear text passwords that have been stored. For
example, if you're using the database session backend, you'll likely
want to delete any session record from the database and purge that
data from any database backups or replicas. In addition, affected
organizations who have suffered a database breach while using an
affected version should inform their users that their clear text
passwords have been compromised. All organizations should encourage
users whose passwords were insecurely stored to change these passwords
on any sites where they were used. As a workaround, wwitching Django's
session storage to use signed cookies instead of the database or cache
lessens the impact of this issue, but should not be done without a
thorough understanding of the security tradeoffs of using signed
cookies rather than a server-side session storage. There is no way to
fully mitigate the issue without upgrading.

Experiences and Telemetry Service improperly handles file operations.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run
processes in an elevated context. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by running a specially crafted application on the victim
system. The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting
how the Connected User Experiences and Telemetry Service handles file
operations.

In Fiber before version 1.12.6, the filename that is given in
c.Attachment() (https://docs.gofiber.io/ctx#attachment) is not
escaped, and therefore vulnerable for a CRLF injection attack. I.e. an
attacker could upload a custom filename and then give the link to the
victim. With this filename, the attacker can change the name of the
downloaded file, redirect to another site, change the authorization
header, etc. A possible workaround is to serialize the input before
passing it to ctx.Attachment().

In Wagtail before versions 2.7.4 and 2.9.3, when a form page type is
made available to Wagtail editors through the `wagtail.contrib.forms`
app, and the page template is built using Django's standard form
rendering helpers such as form.as_p, any HTML tags used within a form
field's help text will be rendered unescaped in the page. Allowing
HTML within help text is an intentional design decision by Django;
however, as a matter of policy Wagtail does not allow editors to
insert arbitrary HTML by default, as this could potentially be used to
carry out cross-site scripting attacks, including privilege
escalation. This functionality should therefore not have been made
available to editor-level users. The vulnerability is not exploitable
by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail admin.
Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.4 (for the LTS 2.7
branch) and Wagtail 2.9.3 (for the current 2.9 branch). In these
versions, help text will be escaped to prevent the inclusion of HTML
tags. Site owners who wish to re-enable the use of HTML within help
text (and are willing to accept the risk of this being exploited by
editors) may set WAGTAILFORMS_HELP_TEXT_ALLOW_HTML = True in their
configuration settings. Site owners who are unable to upgrade to the
new versions can secure their form page templates by rendering forms
field-by-field as per Django's documentation, but omitting the |safe
filter when outputting the help text.

In "I hate money" before version 4.1.5, an authenticated member of one
project can modify and delete members of another project, without
knowledge of this other project's private code. This can be further
exploited to access all bills of another project without knowledge of
this other project's private code. With the default configuration,
anybody is allowed to create a new project. An attacker can create a
new project and then use it to become authenticated and exploit this
flaw. As such, the exposure is similar to an unauthenticated attack,
because it is trivial to become authenticated. This is fixed in
version 4.1.5.

In codecov (npm package) before version 3.7.1 the upload method has a
command injection vulnerability. Clients of the codecov-node library
are unlikely to be aware of this, so they might unwittingly write code
that contains a vulnerability. A similar CVE (CVE-2020-7597 for
GHSA-5q88-cjfq-g2mh) was issued but the fix was incomplete. It only
blocked &, and command injection is still possible using backticks
instead to bypass the sanitizer. The attack surface is low in this
case. Particularly in the standard use of codecov, where the module is
used directly in a build pipeline, not built against as a library in
another application that may supply malicious input and perform
command injection.

In Contour ( Ingress controller for Kubernetes) before version 1.7.0,
a bad actor can shut down all instances of Envoy, essentially killing
the entire ingress data plane. GET requests to /shutdown on port 8090
of the Envoy pod initiate Envoy's shutdown procedure. The shutdown
procedure includes flipping the readiness endpoint to false, which
removes Envoy from the routing pool. When running Envoy (For example
on the host network, pod spec hostNetwork=true), the shutdown
manager's endpoint is accessible to anyone on the network that can
reach the Kubernetes node that's running Envoy. There is no
authentication in place that prevents a rogue actor on the network
from shutting down Envoy via the shutdown manager endpoint. Successful
exploitation of this issue will lead to bad actors shutting down all
instances of Envoy, essentially killing the entire ingress data plane.
This is fixed in version 1.7.0.

In OctoberCMS before version 1.0.468, encrypted cookie values were not
tied to the name of the cookie the value belonged to. This meant that
certain classes of attacks that took advantage of other theoretical
vulnerabilities in user facing code (nothing exploitable in the core
project itself) had a higher chance of succeeding. Specifically, if
your usage exposed a way for users to provide unfiltered user input
and have it returned to them as an encrypted cookie (ex. storing a
user provided search query in a cookie) they could then use the
generated cookie in place of other more tightly controlled cookies; or
if your usage exposed the plaintext version of an encrypted cookie at
any point to the user they could theoretically provide encrypted
content from your application back to it as an encrypted cookie and
force the framework to decrypt it for them. Issue has been fixed in
build 468 (v1.0.468).

In SLPJS (npm package slpjs) before version 0.27.4, there is a
vulnerability to false-positive validation outcomes for the NFT1 Child
Genesis transaction type. A poorly implemented SLP wallet or
opportunistic attacker could create a seemingly valid NFT1 child token
without burning any of the NFT1 Group token type as is required by the
NFT1 specification. This is fixed in version 0.27.4.

In Sulu before versions 1.6.35, 2.0.10, and 2.1.1, when the "Forget
password" feature on the login screen is used, Sulu asks the user for
a username or email address. If the given string is not found, a
response with a `400` error code is returned, along with a error
message saying that this user name does not exist. This enables
attackers to retrieve valid usernames. Also, the response of the
"Forgot Password" request returns the email address to which the email
was sent, if the operation was successful. This information should not
be exposed, as it can be used to gather email addresses. This problem
was fixed in versions 1.6.35, 2.0.10 and 2.1.1.

In faye-websocket before version 0.11.0, there is a lack of
certification validation in TLS handshakes. The
`Faye::WebSocket::Client` class uses the `EM::Connection#start_tls`
method in EventMachine to implement the TLS handshake whenever a
`wss:` URL is used for the connection. This method does not implement
certificate verification by default, meaning that it does not check
that the server presents a valid and trusted TLS certificate for the
expected hostname. That means that any `wss:` connection made using
this library is vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack, since it
does not confirm the identity of the server it is connected to. For
further background information on this issue, please see the
referenced GitHub Advisory. Upgrading `faye-websocket` to v0.11.0 is
recommended.

Faye before version 1.4.0, there is a lack of certification validation
in TLS handshakes. Faye uses em-http-request and faye-websocket in the
Ruby version of its client. Those libraries both use the
`EM::Connection#start_tls` method in EventMachine to implement the TLS
handshake whenever a `wss:` URL is used for the connection. This
method does not implement certificate verification by default, meaning
that it does not check that the server presents a valid and trusted
TLS certificate for the expected hostname. That means that any
`https:` or `wss:` connection made using these libraries is vulnerable
to a man-in-the-middle attack, since it does not confirm the identity
of the server it is connected to. The first request a Faye client
makes is always sent via normal HTTP, but later messages may be sent
via WebSocket. Therefore it is vulnerable to the same problem that
these underlying libraries are, and we needed both libraries to
support TLS verification before Faye could claim to do the same. Your
client would still be insecure if its initial HTTPS request was
verified, but later WebSocket connections were not. This is fixed in
Faye v1.4.0, which enables verification by default. For further
background information on this issue, please see the referenced GitHub
Advisory.

save-server (npm package) before version 1.05 is affected by a CSRF
vulnerability, as there is no CSRF mitigation (Tokens etc.). The fix
introduced in version version 1.05 unintentionally breaks uploading so
version v1.0.7 is the fixed version. This is patched by implementing
Double submit. The CSRF attack would require you to navigate to a
malicious site while you have an active session with Save-Server
(Session key stored in cookies). The malicious user would then be able
to perform some actions, including uploading/deleting files and adding
redirects. If you are logged in as root, this attack is significantly
more severe. They can in addition create, delete and update users. If
they updated the password of a user, that user's files would then be
available. If the root password is updated, all files would be visible
if they logged in with the new password. Note that due to the same
origin policy malicious actors cannot view the gallery or the response
of any of the methods, nor be sure they succeeded. This issue has been
patched in version 1.0.7.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/jwise/HoRNDIS/security/advisories/GHSA-8q4r-m3rh-57jx

All versions of HoRNDIS are affected by an integer overflow in the
RNDIS packet parsing routines. A malicious USB device can trigger
disclosure of unrelated kernel memory to userspace applications on the
host, or can cause the kernel to crash. Kernel memory disclosure is
especially likely on 32-bit kernels; 64-bit kernels are more likely to
crash on attempted exploitation. It is not believed that kernel memory
corruption is possible, or that unattended kernel memory disclosure
without the collaboration of a userspace program running on the host
is possible. The vulnerability is in `HoRNDIS::receivePacket`.
`msg_len`, `data_ofs`, and `data_len` can be controlled by an attached
USB device, and a negative value of `data_ofs` can bypass the check
for `(data_ofs + data_len + 8) > msg_len`, and subsequently can cause
a wild pointer copy in the `mbuf_copyback` call. The software is not
maintained and no patches are planned. Users of multi-tenant systems
with HoRNDIS installed should only connect trusted USB devices to
their system.

In containerd (an industry-standard container runtime) before version
1.2.14 there is a credential leaking vulnerability. If a container
image manifest in the OCI Image format or Docker Image V2 Schema 2
format includes a URL for the location of a specific image layer
(otherwise known as a &#8220;foreign layer&#8221;), the default containerd
resolver will follow that URL to attempt to download it. In v1.2.x but
not 1.3.0 or later, the default containerd resolver will provide its
authentication credentials if the server where the URL is located
presents an HTTP 401 status code along with registry-specific HTTP
headers. If an attacker publishes a public image with a manifest that
directs one of the layers to be fetched from a web server they control
and they trick a user or system into pulling the image, they can
obtain the credentials used for pulling that image. In some cases,
this may be the user's username and password for the registry. In
other cases, this may be the credentials attached to the cloud virtual
instance which can grant access to other cloud resources in the
account. The default containerd resolver is used by the cri-containerd
plugin (which can be used by Kubernetes), the ctr development tool,
and other client programs that have explicitly linked against it. This
vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.2.14. containerd 1.3 and
later are not affected. If you are using containerd 1.3 or later, you
are not affected. If you are using cri-containerd in the 1.2 series or
prior, you should ensure you only pull images from trusted sources.
Other container runtimes built on top of containerd but not using the
default resolver (such as Docker) are not affected.

In XWiki before versions 11.10.5 or 12.2.1, any user with SCRIPT right
(EDIT right before XWiki 7.4) can gain access to the application
server Servlet context which contains tools allowing to instantiate
arbitrary Java objects and invoke methods that may lead to arbitrary
code execution. The only workaround is to give SCRIPT right only to
trusted users.

In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2 there is a bug in which the
`alias` field on a `Chart.yaml` is not properly sanitized. This could
lead to the injection of unwanted information into a chart. This issue
has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11. A possible workaround is
to manually review the `dependencies` field of any untrusted chart,
verifying that the `alias` field is either not used, or (if used) does
not contain newlines or path characters.

In Helm before versions 2.16.11 and 3.3.2, a Helm repository can
contain duplicates of the same chart, with the last one always used.
If a repository is compromised, this lowers the level of access that
an attacker needs to inject a bad chart into a repository. To perform
this attack, an attacker must have write access to the index file
(which can occur during a MITM attack on a non-SSL connection). This
issue has been patched in Helm 3.3.2 and 2.16.11. A possible
workaround is to manually review the index file in the Helm repository
cache before installing software.

boolean and outputs two tensors. Depending on the boolean value, one
of the tensors is exactly the input tensor whereas the other one
should be an empty tensor. However, the eager runtime traverses all
tensors in the output. Since only one of the tensors is defined, the
other one is `nullptr`, hence we are binding a reference to `nullptr`.
This is undefined behavior and reported as an error if compiling with

In Tensorflow before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, if a user passes a list
of strings to `dlpack.to_dlpack` there is a memory leak following an
expected validation failure. The issue occurs because the `status`
argument during validation failures is not properly checked. Since
each of the above methods can return an error status, the `status`
value must be checked before continuing. The issue is patched in
commit 22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and is released in
TensorFlow versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.

In Tensorflow before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, the implementation of
`dlpack.to_dlpack` can be made to use uninitialized memory resulting
in further memory corruption. This is because the pybind11 glue code
assumes that the argument is a tensor. However, there is nothing
stopping users from passing in a Python object instead of a tensor.
The uninitialized memory address is due to a `reinterpret_cast` Since
the `PyObject` is a Python object, not a TensorFlow Tensor, the cast
to `EagerTensor` fails. The issue is patched in commit
22e07fb204386768e5bcbea563641ea11f96ceb8 and is released in TensorFlow
versions 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.

In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1,
the implementation of `SparseFillEmptyRowsGrad` uses a double indexing

In Tensorflow version 2.3.0, the `SparseCountSparseOutput` and
`RaggedCountSparseOutput` implementations don't validate that the
`weights` tensor has the same shape as the data. The check exists for
`DenseCountSparseOutput`, where both tensors are fully specified. In
the sparse and ragged count weights are still accessed in parallel
with the data. But, since there is no validation, a user passing fewer
weights than the values for the tensors can generate a read from
outside the bounds of the heap buffer allocated for the weights. The

In Tensorflow before version 2.3.1, the `RaggedCountSparseOutput`
implementation does not validate that the input arguments form a valid
ragged tensor. In particular, there is no validation that the values
in the `splits` tensor generate a valid partitioning of the `values`
tensor. Thus, the code sets up conditions to cause a heap buffer
overflow. A `BatchedMap` is equivalent to a vector where each element
is a hashmap. However, if the first element of `splits_values` is not
0, `batch_idx` will never be 1, hence there will be no hashmap at
index 0 in `per_batch_counts`. Trying to access that in the user code
results in a segmentation fault. The issue is patched in commit

In Tensorflow before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and 2.3.1,
the `Shard` API in TensorFlow expects the last argument to be a
function taking two `int64` (i.e., `long long`) arguments. However,
there are several places in TensorFlow where a lambda taking `int` or
`int32` arguments is being used. In these cases, if the amount of work
to be parallelized is large enough, integer truncation occurs.
Depending on how the two arguments of the lambda are used, this can
result in segfaults, read/write outside of heap allocated arrays,
stack overflows, or data corruption. The issue is patched in commits

In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and
2.3.1, to mimic Python's indexing with negative values, TFLite uses
`ResolveAxis` to convert negative values to positive indices. However,
the only check that the converted index is now valid is only present
in debug builds. If the `DCHECK` does not trigger, then code execution
moves ahead with a negative index. This, in turn, results in accessing
data out of bounds which results in segfaults and/or data corruption.
The issue is patched in commit
2d88f470dea2671b430884260f3626b1fe99830a, and is released in
TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.

In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and
2.3.1, when determining the common dimension size of two tensors,
TFLite uses a `DCHECK` which is no-op outside of debug compilation
modes. Since the function always returns the dimension of the first
tensor, malicious attackers can craft cases where this is larger than
that of the second tensor. In turn, this would result in reads/writes
outside of bounds since the interpreter will wrongly assume that there
is enough data in both tensors. The issue is patched in commit
8ee24e7949a203d234489f9da2c5bf45a7d5157d, and is released in

In tensorflow-lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and
2.3.1, a crafted TFLite model can force a node to have as input a
tensor backed by a `nullptr` buffer. This can be achieved by changing
a buffer index in the flatbuffer serialization to convert a read-only
tensor to a read-write one. The runtime assumes that these buffers are
written to before a possible read, hence they are initialized with
`nullptr`. However, by changing the buffer index for a tensor and
implicitly converting that tensor to be a read-write one, as there is
nothing in the model that writes to it, we get a null pointer
dereference. The issue is patched in commit 0b5662bc, and is released
in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.

In TensorFlow Lite before versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1 and
2.3.1, saved models in the flatbuffer format use a double indexing
scheme: a model has a set of subgraphs, each subgraph has a set of
operators and each operator has a set of input/output tensors. The
flatbuffer format uses indices for the tensors, indexing into an array
of tensors that is owned by the subgraph. This results in a pattern of
double array indexing when trying to get the data of each tensor.
However, some operators can have some tensors be optional. To handle
this scenario, the flatbuffer model uses a negative `-1` value as
index for these tensors. This results in special casing during
validation at model loading time. Unfortunately, this means that the
`-1` index is a valid tensor index for any operator, including those
that don't expect optional inputs and including for output tensors.
Thus, this allows writing and reading from outside the bounds of heap
allocated arrays, although only at a specific offset from the start of
these arrays. This results in both read and write gadgets, albeit very
limited in scope. The issue is patched in several commits (46d5b0852,
00302787b7, e11f5558, cd31fd0ce, 1970c21, and fff2c83), and is
released in TensorFlow versions 1.15.4, 2.0.3, 2.1.2, 2.2.1, or 2.3.1.
A potential workaround would be to add a custom `Verifier` to the
model loading code to ensure that only operators which accept optional
inputs use the `-1` special value and only for the tensors that they
expect to be optional. Since this allow-list type approach is erro-
prone, we advise upgrading to the patched code.

In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using
segment sum can trigger writes outside of bounds of heap allocated
buffers by inserting negative elements in the segment ids tensor.
Users having access to `segment_ids_data` can alter `output_index` and
then write to outside of `output_data` buffer. This might result in a
segmentation fault but it can also be used to further corrupt the
memory and can be chained with other vulnerabilities to create more
advanced exploits. The issue is patched in commit
204945b19e44b57906c9344c0d00120eeeae178a and is released in TensorFlow

custom `Verifier` to the model loading code to ensure that the segment
ids are all positive, although this only handles the case when the
segment ids are stored statically in the model. A similar validation
could be done if the segment ids are generated at runtime between
inference steps. If the segment ids are generated as outputs of a
tensor during inference steps, then there are no possible workaround
and users are advised to upgrade to patched code.

In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using

In TensorFlow Lite before versions 2.2.1 and 2.3.1, models using
segment sum can trigger a write out bounds / segmentation fault if the
segment ids are not sorted. Code assumes that the segment ids are in
increasing order, using the last element of the tensor holding them to
determine the dimensionality of output tensor. This results in
allocating insufficient memory for the output tensor and in a write

segmentation fault, but depending on runtime conditions it can provide
for a write gadget to be used in future memory corruption-based
exploits. The issue is patched in commit

In Open Enclave before version 0.12.0, an information disclosure
vulnerability exists when an enclave application using the syscalls
provided by the sockets.edl is loaded by a malicious host application.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could read
privileged data from the enclave heap across trust boundaries. To
exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an
affected system and run a specially crafted application. The
vulnerability would not allow an attacker to elevate user rights
directly, but it could be used to obtain information otherwise
considered confidential in an enclave, which could be used in further
compromises. The issue has been addressed in version 0.12.0 and the
current master branch. Users will need to to recompile their
applications against the patched libraries to be protected from this
vulnerability.

django-filter is a generic system for filtering Django QuerySets based
on user selections. In django-filter before version 2.4.0,
automatically generated `NumberFilter` instances, whose value was
later converted to an integer, were subject to potential DoS from
maliciously input using exponential format with sufficiently large
exponents. Version 2.4.0+ applies a `MaxValueValidator` with a a
default `limit_value` of 1e50 to the form field used by `NumberFilter`
instances. In addition, `NumberFilter` implements the new
`get_max_validator()` which should return a configured validator
instance to customise the limit, or else `None` to disable the
additional validation. Users may manually apply an equivalent
validator if they are not able to upgrade.

Singularity (an open source container platform) from version 3.1.1
through 3.6.3 has a vulnerability. Due to insecure handling of path
traversal and the lack of path sanitization within `unsquashfs`, it is
possible to overwrite/create any files on the host filesystem during
the extraction with a crafted squashfs filesystem. The extraction
occurs automatically for unprivileged (either installation or with
`allow setuid = no`) run of Singularity when a user attempt to run an
image which is a local SIF image or a single file containing a
squashfs filesystem and is coming from remote sources `library://` or
`shub://`. Image build is also impacted in a more serious way as it
can be used by a root user, allowing an attacker to overwrite/create
files leading to a system compromise, so far bootstrap methods
`library`, `shub` and `localimage` are triggering the squashfs
extraction. This issue is addressed in Singularity 3.6.4. All users
are advised to upgrade to 3.6.4 especially if they use Singularity
mainly for building image as root user. There is no solid workaround
except to temporary avoid to use unprivileged mode with single file
images in favor of sandbox images instead. Regarding image build,
temporary avoid to build from `library` and `shub` sources and as much
as possible use `--fakeroot` or a VM for that.

ORY Fosite is a security first OAuth2 & OpenID Connect framework for
Go. In Fosite from version 0.30.2 and before version 0.34.1, there is
an issue in which an an attacker can override the registered redirect
URL by performing an OAuth flow and requesting a redirect URL that is
to the loopback adapter. Attackers can provide both custom URL query
parameters to their loopback redirect URL, as well as actually
overriding the host of the registered redirect URL. These attacks are
only applicable in scenarios where the attacker has access over the
loopback interface. This vulnerability has been patched in ORY Fosite
v0.34.1.

attacker to register a client with allowed redirect URL
https://example.com/callback. Then perform an OAuth2 flow and
requesting redirect URL https://example.com/CALLBACK. Instead of an
error (invalid redirect URL), the browser is redirected to
https://example.com/CALLBACK with a potentially successful OAuth2
response, depending on the state of the overall OAuth2 flow (the user
might still deny the request for example). This vulnerability has been
patched in ORY Fosite v0.34.1.

In Wiki.js before version 2.5.151, directory traversal outside of
Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset
cache fetching is enabled. A malicious user can potentially read any
file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for
directory traversal. This is only possible when a storage module
implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is
enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g.
cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit
084dcd69d1591586ee4752101e675d5f0ac6dcdc fixes this vulnerability by
sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The
sanitization step removes any directory traversal (e.g. `..` and `.`)
sequences as well as invalid filesystem characters from the path. As a
workaround, disable any storage module with local asset caching
capabilities such as Local File System and Git.

Blueman is a GTK+ Bluetooth Manager. In Blueman before 2.1.4, the
DhcpClient method of the D-Bus interface to blueman-mechanism is prone
to an argument injection vulnerability. The impact highly depends on
the system configuration. If Polkit-1 is disabled and for versions
lower than 2.0.6, any local user can possibly exploit this. If
Polkit-1 is enabled for version 2.0.6 and later, a possible attacker
needs to be allowed to use the `org.blueman.dhcp.client` action. That
is limited to users in the wheel group in the shipped rules file that
do have the privileges anyway. On systems with ISC DHCP client
(dhclient), attackers can pass arguments to `ip link` with the
interface name that can e.g. be used to bring down an interface or add
an arbitrary XDP/BPF program. On systems with dhcpcd and without ISC
DHCP client, attackers can even run arbitrary scripts by passing
`-c/path/to/script` as an interface name. Patches are included in
2.1.4 and master that change the DhcpClient D-Bus method(s) to accept
BlueZ network object paths instead of network interface names. A
backport to 2.0(.8) is also available. As a workaround, make sure that
Polkit-1-support is enabled and limit privileges for the
`org.blueman.dhcp.client` action to users that are able to run
arbitrary commands as root anyway in
/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/blueman.rules.

In xmpp-http-upload before version 0.4.0, when the GET method is
attacked, attackers can read files which have a `.data` suffix and
which are accompanied by a JSON file with the `.meta` suffix. This can
lead to Information Disclosure and in some shared-hosting scenarios
also to circumvention of authentication or other limitations on the
outbound (GET) traffic. For example, in a scenario where a single
server has multiple instances of the application running (with
separate DATA_ROOT settings), an attacker who has knowledge about the
directory structure is able to read files from any other instance to
which the process has read access. If instances have individual
authentication (for example, HTTP authentication via a reverse proxy,
source IP based filtering) or other restrictions (such as quotas),
attackers may circumvent those limits in such a scenario by using the
Directory Traversal to retrieve data from the other instances. If the
associated XMPP server (or anyone knowing the SECRET_KEY) is
malicious, they can write files outside the DATA_ROOT. The files which
are written are constrained to have the `.meta` and the `.data`
suffixes; the `.meta` file will contain the JSON with the Content-Type
of the original request and the `.data` file will contain the payload.
The issue is patched in version 0.4.0.

Reference: URL:https://rubygems.org/gems/omniauth-auth0

omniauth-auth0 (rubygems) versions >= 2.3.0 and < 2.4.1 improperly
validate the JWT token signature when using the `jwt_validator.verify`
method. Improper validation of the JWT token signature can allow an
attacker to bypass authentication and authorization. You are affected
by this vulnerability if all of the following conditions apply: 1. You
are using `omniauth-auth0`. 2. You are using `JWTValidator.verify`
method directly OR you are not authenticating using the SDK&#8217;s default
Authorization Code Flow. The issue is patched in version 2.4.1.

Next.js versions >=9.5.0 and <9.5.4 are vulnerable to an Open
Redirect. Specially encoded paths could be used with the trailing
slash redirect to allow an open redirect to occur to an external site.
In general, this redirect does not directly harm users although can
allow for phishing attacks by redirecting to an attackers domain from
a trusted domain. The issue is fixed in version 9.5.4.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/smartstore/SmartStoreNET/security/advisories/GHSA-8g9m-jx26-qp4h

Affected versions of Smartstore have a missing WebApi Authentication
attribute. This vulnerability affects Smartstore shops in version
4.0.0 & 4.0.1 which have installed and activated the Web API plugin.
Users of Smartstore 4.0.0 and 4.0.1 must merge their repository with
4.0.x or overwrite the file SmartStore.Web.Framework in the */bin*
directory of the deployed shop with this file. As a workaround without
updating uninstall the Web API plugin to close this vulnerability.

In Sylius before versions 1.6.9, 1.7.9 and 1.8.3, the user may
register in a shop by email mail@example.com, verify it, change it to
the mail another@domain.com and stay verified and enabled. This may
lead to having accounts addressed to totally different emails, that
were verified. Note, that this way one is not able to take over any
existing account (guest or normal one). The issue has been patched in
Sylius 1.6.9, 1.7.9 and 1.8.3. As a workaround, you may resolve this
issue on your own by creating a custom event listener, which will
listen to the sylius.customer.pre_update event. You can determine that
email has been changed if customer email and user username are
different. They are synchronized later on. Pay attention, to email
changing behavior for administrators. You may need to skip this logic
for them. In order to achieve this, you should either check master
request path info, if it does not contain /admin prefix or adjust
event triggered during customer update in the shop. You can find more
information on how to customize the event here.

October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the
Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before
version 1.0.469, an authenticated backend user with the
cms.manage_pages, cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials
permissions who would normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to
be executed by the CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode being enabled is able
to write specific Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute
arbitrary PHP. This is not a problem for anyone that trusts their
users with those permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the
CMS by not having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem
for anyone relying on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with
those permissions in production do not have access to write & execute
arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 469 (v1.0.469) and

October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the
Laravel PHP Framework. In October CMS from version 1.0.319 and before
version 1.0.469, backend users with access to upload files were
permitted to upload SVG files without any sanitization applied to the
uploaded files. Since SVG files support being parsed as HTML by
browsers, this means that they could theoretically upload Javascript
that would be executed on a path under the website's domain (i.e.
/storage/app/media/evil.svg), but they would have to convince their
target to visit that location directly in the target's browser as the
backend does not display SVGs inline anywhere, SVGs are only displayed
as image resources in the backend and are thus unable to be executed.

A memory corruption vulnerability exists when Windows Media Foundation
improperly handles objects in memory. An attacker who successfully
exploited the vulnerability could install programs; view, change, or
delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. There are
multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability, such as by
convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or by
convincing a user to visit a malicious webpage. The security update
addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Media Foundation
handles objects in memory.

In JUnit4 from version 4.7 and before 4.13.1, the test rule
TemporaryFolder contains a local information disclosure vulnerability.
On Unix like systems, the system's temporary directory is shared
between all users on that system. Because of this, when files and
directories are written into this directory they are, by default,
readable by other users on that same system. This vulnerability does
not allow other users to overwrite the contents of these directories
or files. This is purely an information disclosure vulnerability. This
vulnerability impacts you if the JUnit tests write sensitive
information, like API keys or passwords, into the temporary folder,
and the JUnit tests execute in an environment where the OS has other
untrusted users. Because certain JDK file system APIs were only added
in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of the JDK you
are using. For Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability is fixed
in 4.13.1. For Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available, you
must use the workaround below. If you are unable to patch, or are
stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying the `java.io.tmpdir` system
environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the
executing user will fix this vulnerability. For more information,
including an example of vulnerable code, see the referenced GitHub
Security Advisory.

Crossbeam is a set of tools for concurrent programming. In crossbeam-
channel before version 0.4.4, the bounded channel incorrectly assumes
that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number
of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee
that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded`
channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect
assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with
the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different
sizes with the number of iterator elements. This has been fixed in
crossbeam-channel 0.4.4.

A prototype pollution vulnerability has been found in `object-path` <=
0.11.4 affecting the `set()` method. The vulnerability is limited to
the `includeInheritedProps` mode (if version >= 0.11.0 is used), which
has to be explicitly enabled by creating a new instance of `object-
path` and setting the option `includeInheritedProps: true`, or by
using the default `withInheritedProps` instance. The default operating
mode is not affected by the vulnerability if version >= 0.11.0 is
used. Any usage of `set()` in versions < 0.11.0 is vulnerable. The
issue is fixed in object-path version 0.11.5 As a workaround, don't
use the `includeInheritedProps: true` options or the
`withInheritedProps` instance if using a version >= 0.11.0.

containerd is an industry-standard container runtime and is available
as a daemon for Linux and Windows. In containerd before versions 1.3.9
and 1.4.3, the containerd-shim API is improperly exposed to host
network containers. Access controls for the shim&#8217;s API socket verified
that the connecting process had an effective UID of 0, but did not
otherwise restrict access to the abstract Unix domain socket. This
would allow malicious containers running in the same network namespace
as the shim, with an effective UID of 0 but otherwise reduced
privileges, to cause new processes to be run with elevated privileges.
This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.3.9 and 1.4.3. Users
should update to these versions as soon as they are released. It
should be noted that containers started with an old version of
containerd-shim should be stopped and restarted, as running containers
will continue to be vulnerable even after an upgrade. If you are not
providing the ability for untrusted users to start containers in the
same network namespace as the shim (typically the "host" network
namespace, for example with docker run --net=host or hostNetwork: true
in a Kubernetes pod) and run with an effective UID of 0, you are not
vulnerable to this issue. If you are running containers with a
vulnerable configuration, you can deny access to all abstract sockets
with AppArmor by adding a line similar to deny unix addr=@**, to your
policy. It is best practice to run containers with a reduced set of
privileges, with a non-zero UID, and with isolated namespaces. The
containerd maintainers strongly advise against sharing namespaces with
the host. Reducing the set of isolation mechanisms used for a
container necessarily increases that container's privilege, regardless
of what container runtime is used for running that container.

In Wire before 3.20.x, `shell.openExternal` was used without checking
the URL. This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute code on the
victims machine by sending messages containing links with arbitrary
protocols. The victim has to interact with the link and sees the URL
that is opened. The issue was patched by implementing a helper
function which checks if the URL's protocol is common. If it is
common, the URL will be opened externally. If not, the URL will not be
opened and a warning appears for the user informing them that a
probably insecure URL was blocked from being executed. The issue is
patched in Wire 3.20.x. More technical details about exploitation are
available in the linked advisory.

PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library
written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as
SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In version 2.10 and earlier, PJSIP
transport can be reused if they have the same IP address + port +
protocol. However, this is insufficient for secure transport since it
lacks remote hostname authentication. Suppose we have created a TLS
connection to `sip.foo.com`, which has an IP address `100.1.1.1`. If
we want to create a TLS connection to another hostname, say
`sip.bar.com`, which has the same IP address, then it will reuse that
existing connection, even though `100.1.1.1` does not have certificate
to authenticate as `sip.bar.com`. The vulnerability allows for an
insecure interaction without user awareness. It affects users who need
access to connections to different destinations that translate to the
same address, and allows man-in-the-middle attack if attacker can
route a connection to another destination such as in the case of DNS
spoofing.

On Windows the Veyon Service before version 4.4.2 contains an unquoted
service path vulnerability, allowing locally authenticated users with
administrative privileges to run malicious executables with
LocalSystem privileges. Since Veyon users (both students and teachers)
usually don't have administrative privileges, this vulnerability is
only dangerous in anyway unsafe setups. The problem has been fixed in
version 4.4.2. As a workaround, the exploitation of the vulnerability
can be prevented by revoking administrative privileges from all
potentially untrustworthy users.

In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, an attacker can pass an invalid
`axis` value to `tf.quantization.quantize_and_dequantize`. This
results in accessing a dimension outside the rank of the input tensor
in the C++ kernel implementation. However, dim_size only does a DCHECK
to validate the argument and then uses it to access the corresponding
element of an array. Since in normal builds, `DCHECK`-like macros are
no-ops, this results in segfault and access out of bounds of the
array. The issue is patched in
eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808 and TensorFlow 2.4.0 will be
released containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this
commit will also have the issue resolved.

In Tensorflow before version 2.4.0, when the `boxes` argument of
`tf.image.crop_and_resize` has a very large value, the CPU kernel
implementation receives it as a C++ `nan` floating point value.
Attempting to operate on this is undefined behavior which later
produces a segmentation fault. The issue is patched in
eccb7ec454e6617738554a255d77f08e60ee0808 and TensorFlow 2.4.0 will be
released containing the patch. TensorFlow nightly packages after this

version 1.0.1, an attacker can execute arbitrary (*) shell commands if
they can control the value of [the `tag` input] or manage to alter the
value of [the `GITHUB_REF` environment variable]. The problem has been
patched in version 1.0.1. If you don't use the `tag` input you are
most likely safe. The `GITHUB_REF` environment variable is protected
by the GitHub Actions environment so attacks from there should be
impossible. If you must use the `tag` input and cannot upgrade to `>
1.0.0` make sure that the value is not controlled by another Action.

Red Discord Bot before version 3.4.1 has an unauthorized privilege
escalation exploit in the Mod module. This exploit allows Discord
users with a high privilege level within the guild to bypass hierarchy
checks when the application is in a specific condition that is beyond
that user's control. By abusing this exploit, it is possible to
perform destructive actions within the guild the user has high
privileges in. This exploit has been fixed in version 3.4.1. As a
workaround, unloading the Mod module with unload mod or, disabling the
massban command with command disable global massban can render this
exploit not accessible. We still highly recommend updating to 3.4.1 to

RIOT 2020.04 has a buffer overflow in the base64 decoder. The decoding
function base64_decode() uses an output buffer estimation function to
compute the required buffer capacity and validate against the provided
buffer size. The base64_estimate_decode_size() function calculates the
expected decoded size with an arithmetic round-off error and does not
take into account possible padding bytes. Due to this underestimation,
it may be possible to craft base64 input that causes a buffer
overflow.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the
scripting engine handles objects in memory in Microsoft Edge (HTML-
based). The vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an
attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current
user. An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could
gain the same user rights as the current user. If the current user is
logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who
successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an
affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially
crafted website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability through
Microsoft Edge (HTML-based) and then convince a user to view the
website. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised
websites and websites that accept or host user-provided content or
advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content
that could exploit the vulnerability. The security update addresses
the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles
objects in memory.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 HVM guest
OS users to cause a hypervisor crash. An inverted conditional in x86
HVM guests' dirty video RAM tracking code allows such guests to make
Xen de-reference a pointer guaranteed to point at unmapped space. A
malicious or buggy HVM guest may cause the hypervisor to crash,
resulting in Denial of Service (DoS) affecting the entire host. Xen
versions from 4.8 onwards are affected. Xen versions 4.7 and earlier
are not affected. Only x86 systems are affected. Arm systems are not
affected. Only x86 HVM guests using shadow paging can leverage the
vulnerability. In addition, there needs to be an entity actively
monitoring a guest's video frame buffer (typically for display
purposes) in order for such a guest to be able to leverage the
vulnerability. x86 PV guests, as well as x86 HVM guests using hardware
assisted paging (HAP), cannot leverage the vulnerability.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/07/07/5

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Arm guest OS
users to cause a hypervisor crash because of a missing alignment check
in VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info. The hypercall VCPUOP_register_vcpu_info
is used by a guest to register a shared region with the hypervisor.
The region will be mapped into Xen address space so it can be directly
accessed. On Arm, the region is accessed with instructions that
require a specific alignment. Unfortunately, there is no check that
the address provided by the guest will be correctly aligned. As a
result, a malicious guest could cause a hypervisor crash by passing a
misaligned address. A malicious guest administrator may cause a
hypervisor crash, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). All Xen
versions are vulnerable. Only Arm systems are vulnerable. x86 systems
are not affected.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20200707 Xen Security Advisory 321 v3 (CVE-2020-15565) - insufficient cache write-back under VT-d

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing x86 Intel HVM
guest OS users to cause a host OS denial of service or possibly gain
privileges because of insufficient cache write-back under VT-d. When
page tables are shared between IOMMU and CPU, changes to them require
flushing of both TLBs. Furthermore, IOMMUs may be non-coherent, and
hence prior to flushing IOMMU TLBs, a CPU cache also needs writing
back to memory after changes were made. Such writing back of cached
data was missing in particular when splitting large page mappings into
smaller granularity ones. A malicious guest may be able to retain
read/write DMA access to frames returned to Xen's free pool, and later
reused for another purpose. Host crashes (leading to a Denial of
Service) and privilege escalation cannot be ruled out. Xen versions
from at least 3.2 onwards are affected. Only x86 Intel systems are
affected. x86 AMD as well as Arm systems are not affected. Only x86
HVM guests using hardware assisted paging (HAP), having a passed
through PCI device assigned, and having page table sharing enabled can
leverage the vulnerability. Note that page table sharing will be
enabled (by default) only if Xen considers IOMMU and CPU large page
size support compatible.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users
to cause a host OS crash because of incorrect error handling in event-
channel port allocation. The allocation of an event-channel port may
fail for multiple reasons: (1) port is already in use, (2) the memory
allocation failed, or (3) the port we try to allocate is higher than
what is supported by the ABI (e.g., 2L or FIFO) used by the guest or
the limit set by an administrator (max_event_channels in xl cfg). Due
to the missing error checks, only (1) will be considered an error. All
the other cases will provide a valid port and will result in a crash
when trying to access the event channel. When the administrator
configured a guest to allow more than 1023 event channels, that guest
may be able to crash the host. When Xen is out-of-memory, allocation
of new event channels will result in crashing the host rather than
reporting an error. Xen versions 4.10 and later are affected. All
architectures are affected. The default configuration, when guests are
created with xl/libxl, is not vulnerable, because of the default
event-channel limit.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing Intel guest OS
users to gain privileges or cause a denial of service because of non-
atomic modification of a live EPT PTE. When mapping guest EPT (nested
paging) tables, Xen would in some circumstances use a series of non-
atomic bitfield writes. Depending on the compiler version and
optimisation flags, Xen might expose a dangerous partially written PTE
to the hardware, which an attacker might be able to race to exploit. A
guest administrator or perhaps even an unprivileged guest user might
be able to cause denial of service, data corruption, or privilege
escalation. Only systems using Intel CPUs are vulnerable. Systems
using AMD CPUs, and Arm systems, are not vulnerable. Only systems
using nested paging (hap, aka nested paging, aka in this case Intel
EPT) are vulnerable. Only HVM and PVH guests can exploit the
vulnerability. The presence and scope of the vulnerability depends on
the precise optimisations performed by the compiler used to build Xen.
If the compiler generates (a) a single 64-bit write, or (b) a series
of read-modify-write operations in the same order as the source code,
the hypervisor is not vulnerable. For example, in one test build using
GCC 8.3 with normal settings, the compiler generated multiple
(unlocked) read-modify-write operations in source-code order, which
did not constitute a vulnerability. We have not been able to survey
compilers; consequently we cannot say which compiler(s) might produce
vulnerable code (with which code-generation options). The source code
clearly violates the C rules, and thus should be considered
vulnerable.

A vulnerability in the Private Internet Access (PIA) VPN Client for
Linux 1.5 through 2.3+ allows remote attackers to bypass an intended
VPN kill switch mechanism and read sensitive information via
intercepting network traffic. Since 1.5, PIA has supported a &#8220;split

iptables firewall is designed to protect you while using the Internet.
When the kill switch is configured to block all inbound and outbound
network traffic, privileged applications can continue sending &
receiving network traffic if net.ipv4.ip_forward has been enabled in
the system kernel parameters. For example, a Docker container running
on a host with the VPN turned off, and the kill switch turned on, can
continue using the internet, leaking the host IP (CWE 200). In PIA
2.4.0+, policy-based routing is enabled by default and is used to
direct all forwarded packets to the VPN interface automatically.

** DISPUTED ** Trustwave ModSecurity 3.x through 3.0.4 allows denial
of service via a special request. NOTE: The discoverer reports
"Trustwave has signaled they are disputing our claims." The CVE
suggests that there is a security issue with how ModSecurity handles
regular expressions that can result in a Denial of Service condition.
The vendor does not consider this as a security issue because1) there
is no default configuration issue here. An attacker would need to know
that a rule using a potentially problematic regular expression was in
place, 2) the attacker would need to know the basic nature of the
regular expression itself to exploit any resource issues. It's well
known that regular expression usage can be taxing on system resources
regardless of the use case. It is up to the administrator to decide on
when it is appropriate to trade resources for potential security
benefit.

Reference: URL:https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-US/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1563

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Office
software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user
is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take
control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer
user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who
operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of the
vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with
an affected version of Microsoft Office. In an email attack scenario,
an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially
crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. The
security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how
Microsoft Office handles objects in memory.

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows kernel
fails to properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who
successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in
kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or
delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. To exploit
this vulnerability, an attacker would first have to log on to the
system. An attacker could then run a specially crafted application to
take control of an affected system. The update addresses the
vulnerability by correcting how the Windows kernel handles objects in
memory.

An OAuth session fixation vulnerability existed in the VPN login flow,
where an attacker could craft a custom login URL, convince a VPN user
to login via that URL, and obtain authenticated access as that user.
This issue is limited to cases where attacker and victim are sharing
the same source IP and could allow the ability to view session states
and disconnect VPN sessions. This vulnerability affects Mozilla VPN
iOS 1.0.7 < (929), Mozilla VPN Windows < 1.2.2, and Mozilla VPN
Android 1.1.0 < (1360).

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Microsoft Edge PDF
Reader improperly handles objects in memory. The vulnerability could
corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who
successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user
rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with
administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of an
affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
To exploit the vulnerability, in a web-based attack scenario, an
attacker could host a website that contains malicious PDF content. In
addition, compromised websites and websites that accept or host user-
provided content could contain specially crafted PDF content that
could exploit the vulnerability. However, in all cases an attacker
would have no way to force a user to view the attacker-controlled
content. Instead, an attacker would have to convince a user to take
action. For example, an attacker could trick a user into clicking a
link that takes the user to the attacker's site. The security update
addresses the vulnerability by modifying how Microsoft Edge PDF Reader
handles objects in memory.

ensuring they could not be incorrectly associated with a different
origin. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 82.

TOCTOU Race Condition vulnerability in apport allows a local attacker
to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code. An attacker may
exit the crashed process and exploit PID recycling to spawn a root
process with the same PID as the crashed process, which can then be
used to escalate privileges. Fixed in 2.20.1-0ubuntu2.24, 2.20.9

There is no input validation on the Locale property in an apt
transaction. An unprivileged user can supply a full path to a writable
directory, which lets aptd read a file as root. Having a symlink in
place results in an error message if the file exists, and no error
otherwise. This way an unprivileged user can check for the existence
of any files on the system as root.

shim, allowing secure boot to be bypassed. This only affects systems
where the kernel signing certificate has been imported directly into
the secure boot database and the GRUB image is booted directly without
the use of shim. This issue affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior
versions.

Integer overflows were discovered in the functions grub_cmd_initrd and
grub_initrd_init in the efilinux component of GRUB2, as shipped in
Debian, Red Hat, and Ubuntu (the functionality is not included in
GRUB2 upstream), leading to a heap-based buffer overflow. These could
be triggered by an extremely large number of arguments to the initrd
command on 32-bit architectures, or a crafted filesystem with very
large files on any architecture. An attacker could use this to execute
arbitrary code and bypass UEFI Secure Boot restrictions. This issue
affects GRUB2 version 2.04 and prior versions.

A cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists when Microsoft
SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web
request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker
could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request
to an affected SharePoint server. The attacker who successfully
exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting
attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of
the current user. The attacks could allow the attacker to read content
that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity
to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as
change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in
the browser of the user. The security update addresses the
vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly
sanitizes web requests.

An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due
to incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Smuggling attacks may
succeed against HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning.
This allows any client, including browser scripts, to bypass local
security and poison the proxy cache and any downstream caches with
content from an arbitrary source. When configured for relaxed header
parsing (the default), Squid relays headers containing whitespace
characters to upstream servers. When this occurs as a prefix to a
Content-Length header, the frame length specified will be ignored by
Squid (allowing for a conflicting length to be used from another
Content-Length header) but relayed upstream.

An issue was discovered in Squid before 4.13 and 5.x before 5.0.4. Due
to incorrect data validation, HTTP Request Splitting attacks may
succeed against HTTP and HTTPS traffic. This leads to cache poisoning.
This allows any client, including browser scripts, to bypass local
security and poison the browser cache and any downstream caches with
content from an arbitrary source. Squid uses a string search instead
of parsing the Transfer-Encoding header to find chunked encoding. This
allows an attacker to hide a second request inside Transfer-Encoding:
it is interpreted by Squid as chunked and split out into a second
request delivered upstream. Squid will then deliver two distinct
responses to the client, corrupting any downstream caches.

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/Graylog2/graylog2-server/issues/5906

Graylog before 3.3.3 lacks SSL Certificate Validation for LDAP
servers. It allows use of an external user/group database stored in
LDAP. The connection configuration allows the usage of unencrypted,
SSL- or TLS-secured connections. Unfortunately, the Graylog client
code (in all versions that support LDAP) does not implement proper
certificate validation (regardless of whether the "Allow self-signed
certificates" option is used). Therefore, any attacker with the
ability to intercept network traffic between a Graylog server and an
LDAP server is able to redirect traffic to a different LDAP server
(unnoticed by the Graylog server due to the lack of certificate
validation), effectively bypassing Graylog's authentication mechanism.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Access
software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user
is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take
control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer
user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who
operate with administrative user rights. Exploitation of the
vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with
an affected version of Microsoft Access. In an email attack scenario,
an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially
crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. The
security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how
Microsoft Access handles objects in memory.

Reference: MISC:https://supportannouncement.us.dlink.com/announcement/publication.aspx?name=SAP10169

An issue was discovered in apply.cgi on D-Link DAP-1520 devices before
1.10b04Beta02. Whenever a user performs a login action from the web
interface, the request values are being forwarded to the ssi binary.
On the login page, the web interface restricts the password input
field to a fixed length of 15 characters. The problem is that
validation is being done on the client side, hence it can be bypassed.
When an attacker manages to intercept the login request (POST based)
and tampers with the vulnerable parameter (log_pass), to a larger
length, the request will be forwarded to the webserver. This results
in a stack-based buffer overflow. A few other POST variables,
(transferred as part of the login request) are also vulnerable:
html_response_page and log_user.

An authentication-bypass issue was discovered on D-Link DAP-1522
devices 1.4x before 1.10b04Beta02. There exist a few pages that are
directly accessible by any unauthorized user, e.g., logout.php and

webpage without any authentication. By appending a query string
NO_NEED_AUTH with the value of 1 to any protected URL, any
unauthorized user can access the application directly, as demonstrated

Reference: MISC:https://www.solarwindsmsp.com/products/n-central

SolarWinds N-central through 2020.1 allows session hijacking and
requires user interaction or physical access. The N-Central JSESSIONID
cookie attribute is not checked against multiple sources such as
sourceip, MFA claim, etc. as long as the victim stays logged in within
N-Central. To take advantage of this, cookie could be stolen and the
JSESSIONID can be captured. On its own this is not a surprising
result; low security tools allow the cookie to roam from machine to
machine. The JSESSION cookie can then be used on the attackers&#8217;
workstation by browsing to the victim&#8217;s NCentral server URL and
replacing the JSESSIONID attribute value by the captured value.
Expected behavior would be to check this against a second source and
enforce at least a reauthentication or multi factor request as
N-Central is a highly privileged service.

A cross site scripting vulnerability exists when Microsoft Dynamics
365 (on-premises) does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web
request to an affected Dynamics server. An authenticated attacker
could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request
to an affected Dynamics server. The attacker who successfully
exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting
attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of
the current authenticated user. These attacks could allow the attacker
to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the
victim's identity to take actions within Dynamics Server on behalf of
the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject
malicious content in the browser of the user. The security update
addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that Dynamics Server
properly sanitizes web requests.

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel
software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user
is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take
control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer
user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who
operate with administrative user rights.</p> <p>Exploitation of the
vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with
an affected version of Microsoft Excel. In an email attack scenario,
an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially
crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In
a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or
leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided
content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the
vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit
the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to
click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant
message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted
file.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by
correcting how Microsoft Excel handles objects in memory.</p>

vulnerability by issuing specially crafted requests to the ASP.NET
Core application. The update addresses the vulnerability by correcting
how the ASP.NET Core web application handles web requests.

<p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows
Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) service improperly handles objects in
memory. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An attacker
could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create
new accounts with full user rights.</p> <p>To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker would have to log on to an affected system
and run a specially crafted script or application.</p> <p>The update
addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the Windows UPnP service
handles objects in memory.</p>

Specific IPv6 packets sent by clients processed by the Routing Engine
(RE) are improperly handled. These IPv6 packets are designed to be
blocked by the RE from egressing the RE. Instead, the RE allows these
specific IPv6 packets to egress the RE, at which point a mbuf memory
leak occurs within the Juniper Networks Junos OS device. This memory
leak eventually leads to a kernel crash (vmcore), or the device
hanging and requiring a power cycle to restore service, creating a
Denial of Service (DoS) condition. During the time where mbufs are
rising, yet not fully filled, some traffic from client devices may
begin to be black holed. To be black holed, this traffic must match
the condition where this traffic must be processed by the RE.
Continued receipt and attempted egress of these specific IPv6 packets
from the Routing Engine (RE) will create an extended Denial of Service
(DoS) condition. Scenarios which have been observed are: 1. In a
single chassis, single RE scenario, the device will hang without
vmcore, or a vmcore may occur and then hang. In this scenario the
device needs to be power cycled. 2. In a single chassis, dual RE
scenario, the device master RE will fail over to the backup RE. In
this scenario, the master and the backup REs need to be reset from
time to time when they vmcore. There is no need to power cycle the
device. 3. In a dual chassis, single RE scenario, the device will hang
without vmcore, or a vmcore may occur and then hang. In this scenario,
the two chassis' design relies upon some type of network level
redundancy - VRRP, GRES, NSR, etc. - 3.a In a commanded switchover,
where nonstop active routing (NSR) is enabled no session loss is
observed. 4. In a dual chassis, dual chassis scenario, rely upon the
RE to RE failover as stated in the second scenario. In the unlikely
event that the device does not switch RE to RE gracefully, then the
fallback position is to the network level services scenario in the
third scenario. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 16.1

Overlayfs did not properly perform permission checking when copying up
files in an overlayfs and could be exploited from within a user
namespace, if, for example, unprivileged user namespaces were allowed.
It was possible to have a file not readable by an unprivileged user to
be copied to a mountpoint controlled by the user, like a removable
device. This was introduced in kernel version 4.19 by commit d1d04ef
("ovl: stack file ops"). This was fixed in kernel version 5.8 by
commits 56230d9 ("ovl: verify permissions in ovl_path_open()"),
48bd024 ("ovl: switch to mounter creds in readdir") and 05acefb ("ovl:
check permission to open real file"). Additionally, commits 130fdbc
("ovl: pass correct flags for opening real directory") and 292f902
("ovl: call secutiry hook in ovl_real_ioctl()") in kernel 5.8 might
also be desired or necessary. These additional commits introduced a
regression in overlay mounts within user namespaces which prevented
access to files with ownership outside of the user namespace. This
regression was mitigated by subsequent commit b6650da ("ovl: do not
fail because of O_NOATIMEi") in kernel 5.11.

This issue occurs on Juniper Networks Junos OS devices which do not
support Advanced Forwarding Interface (AFI) / Advanced Forwarding
Toolkit (AFT). Devices using AFI and AFT are not exploitable to this
issue. An improper initialization of memory in the packet forwarding
architecture in Juniper Networks Junos OS non-AFI/AFT platforms which
may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability being exploited
when a genuine packet is received and inspected by non-AFT/AFI sFlow
and when the device is also configured with firewall policers. This
first genuine packet received and inspected by sampled flow (sFlow)
through a specific firewall policer will cause the device to reboot.
After the reboot has completed, if the device receives and sFlow
inspects another genuine packet seen through a specific firewall
policer, the device will generate a core file and reboot. Continued
inspection of these genuine packets will create an extended Denial of
Service (DoS) condition. Depending on the method for service
restoration, e.g. hard boot or soft reboot, a core file may or may not
be generated the next time the packet is received and inspected by
sFlow. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 17.4 versions

before 17.4R1. This issue is not applicable to Junos OS Evolved or
Junos OS with Advanced Forwarding Toolkit (AFT) forwarding
implementations which use a different implementation of sFlow. The
following example information is unrelated to this issue and is
provided solely to assist you with determining if you have AFT or not.
Example: A Junos OS device which supports the use of EVPN signaled
VPWS with Flexible Cross Connect uses the AFT implementation. Since
this configuration requires support and use of the AFT implementation
to support this configuration, the device is not vulnerable to this
issue as the sFlow implementation is different using the AFT
architecture. For further details about AFT visit the AFI / AFT are in
the links below. If you are uncertain if you use the AFI/AFT
implementation or not, there are configuration examples in the links
below which you may use to determine if you are vulnerable to this
issue or not. If the commands work, you are. If not, you are not. You
may also use the Feature Explorer to determine if AFI/AFT is supported
or not. If you are still uncertain, please contact your support
resources.

A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on vMX and MX150 devices
may allow an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending
specific packets requiring special processing in microcode that the
flow cache can't handle, causing the riot forwarding daemon to crash.
By continuously sending the same specific packets, an attacker can
repeatedly crash the riot process causing a sustained Denial of
Service. Flow cache is specific to vMX based products and the MX150,
and is enabled by default in performance mode. This issue can only be
triggered by traffic destined to the device. Transit traffic will not
cause the riot daemon to crash. When the issue occurs, a core dump and
riot log file entry are generated. For example:

A buffer overflow vulnerability in lxm5700m_print_page() in
devices/gdevlxm.c of Artifex Software GhostScript v9.50 allows a
remote attacker to cause a denial of service via a crafted eps file.
This is fixed in v9.51.

Name: CVE-2020-1631
Status: Candidate
Reference: CONFIRM:https://kb.juniper.net/JSA11021

A vulnerability in the HTTP/HTTPS service used by J-Web, Web
Authentication, Dynamic-VPN (DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-
Through with Web-Redirect, and Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) allows an
unauthenticated attacker to perform local file inclusion (LFI) or path
traversal. Using this vulnerability, an attacker may be able to inject
commands into the httpd.log, read files with 'world' readable
permission file or obtain J-Web session tokens. In the case of command
injection, as the HTTP service runs as user 'nobody', the impact of
this command injection is limited. (CVSS score 5.3, vector
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) In the case of reading
files with 'world' readable permission, in Junos OS 19.3R1 and above,
the unauthenticated attacker would be able to read the configuration
file. (CVSS score 5.9, vector CVSS:3.1/
AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N) If J-Web is enabled, the attacker
could gain the same level of access of anyone actively logged into
J-Web. If an administrator is logged in, the attacker could gain
administrator access to J-Web. (CVSS score 8.8, vector
CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) This issue only affects
Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services enabled.
Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS services disabled are not affected.
If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled, the following command will show
the httpd processes: user@device> show system processes | match http
5260 - S 0:00.13 /usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10
/usr/sbin/httpd --config /jail/var/etc/httpd.conf To summarize: If
HTTP/HTTPS services are disabled, there is no impact from this
vulnerability. If HTTP/HTTPS services are enabled and J-Web is not in
use, this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 5.9
(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N). If J-Web is enabled,
this vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.8
(CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H). Juniper SIRT has
received a single report of this vulnerability being exploited in the
wild. Out of an abundance of caution, we are notifying customers so
they can take appropriate actions. Indicators of Compromise: The
/var/log/httpd.log may have indicators that commands have injected or
files being accessed. The device administrator can look for these
indicators by searching for the string patterns "=*;*&" or "*%3b*&" in
/var/log/httpd.log, using the following command: user@device> show log
httpd.log | match "=*;*&|=*%3b*&" If this command returns any output,
it might be an indication of malicious attempts or simply scanning
activities. Rotated logs should also be reviewed, using the following
command: user@device> show log httpd.log.0.gz | match "=*;*&|=*%3b*&"
user@device> show log httpd.log.1.gz | match "=*;*&|=*%3b*&" Note that
a skilled attacker would likely remove these entries from the local
log file, thus effectively eliminating any reliable signature that the
device had been attacked. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS

In a certain condition, receipt of a specific BGP UPDATE message might
cause Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved devices to
advertise an invalid BGP UPDATE message to other peers, causing the
other peers to terminate the established BGP session, creating a
Denial of Service (DoS) condition. For example, Router A sends a
specific BGP UPDATE to Router B, causing Router B to send an invalid
BGP UPDATE message to Router C, resulting in termination of the BGP
session between Router B and Router C. This issue might occur when
there is at least a single BGP session established on the device that
does not support 4 Byte AS extension (RFC 4893). Repeated receipt of
the same BGP UPDATE can result in an extended DoS condition. This

Due to a new NDP proxy feature for EVPN leaf nodes introduced in Junos
OS 17.4, crafted NDPv6 packets could transit a Junos device configured
as a Broadband Network Gateway (BNG) and reach the EVPN leaf node,
causing a stale MAC address entry. This could cause legitimate traffic
to be discarded, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This
issue only affects Junos OS 17.4 and later releases. Prior releases do
not support this feature and are unaffected by this vulnerability.

The FPC (Flexible PIC Concentrator) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and
Junos OS Evolved may restart after processing a specific IPv4 packet.
Only packets destined to the device itself, successfully reaching the
RE through existing edge and control plane filtering, will be able to
cause the FPC restart. When this issue occurs, all traffic via the FPC
will be dropped. By continuously sending this specific IPv4 packet, an
attacker can repeatedly crash the FPC, causing an extended Denial of
Service (DoS) condition. This issue can only occur when processing a
specific IPv4 packet. IPv6 packets cannot trigger this issue. This
issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series with MPC10E or
MPC11E and PTX10001: 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S4, 19.2R2; 19.3

An improper use of a validation framework when processing incoming
genuine BGP packets within Juniper Networks RPD (routing protocols
process) daemon allows an attacker to crash RPD thereby causing a
Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This framework requires these
packets to be passed. By continuously sending any of these types of
formatted genuine packets, an attacker can repeatedly crash the RPD
process causing a sustained Denial of Service. Authentication to the
BGP peer is not required. This issue can be initiated or propagated
through eBGP and iBGP and can impact devices in either modes of use as
long as the devices are configured to support the compromised
framework and a BGP path is activated or active. This issue affects:

causing a sustained Denial of Service. Note: Only systems utilizing
ARM processors, found on the EX2300 and EX3400, are vulnerable to this
issue. Systems shipped with other processor architectures are not
vulnerable to this issue. The processor architecture can be displayed
via the 'uname -a' command. For example: ARM (vulnerable): % uname -a
| awk '{print $NF}' arm PowerPC (not vulnerable): % uname -a | awk

On Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved devices, processing
a specific UPDATE for an EBGP peer can lead to a routing process
daemon (RPD) crash and restart. This issue occurs only when the device
is receiving and processing the BGP UPDATE for an EBGP peer. This
issue does not occur when the device is receiving and processing the
BGP UPDATE for an IBGP peer. However, the offending BGP UPDATE can
originally come from an EBGP peer, propagates through the network via
IBGP peers without causing crash, then it causes RPD crash when it is
processed for a BGP UPDATE towards an EBGP peer. Repeated receipt and
processing of the same specific BGP UPDATE can result in an extended
Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects: Juniper

On Juniper Networks Junos OS devices, a stream of TCP packets sent to
the Routing Engine (RE) may cause mbuf leak which can lead to Flexible
PIC Concentrator (FPC) crash or the system to crash and restart
(vmcore). This issue can be trigged by IPv4 or IPv6 and it is caused
only by TCP packets. This issue is not related to any specific
configuration and it affects Junos OS releases starting from 17.4R1.
However, this issue does not affect Junos OS releases prior to 18.2R1
when Nonstop active routing (NSR) is configured [edit routing-options
nonstop-routing]. The number of mbufs is platform dependent. The
following command provides the number of mbufs counter that are
currently in use and maximum number of mbufs that can be allocated on
a platform: user@host> show system buffers 2437/3143/5580 mbufs in use
(current/cache/total) Once the device runs out of mbufs, the FPC
crashes or the vmcore occurs and the device might become inaccessible
requiring a manual restart. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos
OS 17.4 versions prior to 17.4R2-S11, 17.4R3-S2; 18.1 versions prior

The DHCPv6 Relay-Agent service, part of the Juniper Enhanced jdhcpd
daemon shipped with Juniper Networks Junos OS has an Improper Input
Validation vulnerability which will result in a Denial of Service
(DoS) condition when a DHCPv6 client sends a specific DHPCv6 message
allowing an attacker to potentially perform a Remote Code Execution
(RCE) attack on the target device. Continuous receipt of the specific
DHCPv6 client message will result in an extended Denial of Service
(DoS) condition. If adjacent devices are also configured to relay DHCP
packets, and are not affected by this issue and simply transparently
forward unprocessed client DHCPv6 messages, then the attack vector can
be a Network-based attack, instead of an Adjacent-device attack. No
other DHCP services are affected. Receipt of the packet without
configuration of the DHCPv6 Relay-Agent service, will not result in
exploitability of this issue. This issue affects Juniper Networks

When DNS filtering is enabled on Juniper Networks Junos MX Series with
one of the following cards MS-PIC, MS-MIC or MS-MPC, an incoming
stream of packets processed by the Multiservices PIC Management Daemon
(mspmand) process, responsible for managing "URL Filtering service",
may crash, causing the Services PIC to restart. While the Services PIC
is restarting, all PIC services including DNS filtering service (DNS
sink holing) will be bypassed until the Services PIC completes its
boot process. This vulnerability might allow an attacker to cause an
extended Denial of Service (DoS) attack against the device and to
cause clients to be vulnerable to DNS based attacks by malicious DNS
servers when they send DNS requests through the device. As a result,
devices which were once protected by the DNS Filtering service are no
longer protected and at risk of exploitation. This issue affects
Juniper Networks Junos OS: 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 18.3

On Juniper Networks Junos OS devices configured as a DHCP forwarder,
the Juniper Networks Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol Daemon
(jdhcp) process might crash when receiving a malformed DHCP packet.
This issue only affects devices configured as DHCP forwarder with
forward-only option, that forward specified DHCP client packets,
without creating a new subscriber session. The jdhcpd daemon
automatically restarts without intervention, but continuous receipt of
the malformed DHCP packet will repeatedly crash jdhcpd, leading to an
extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue can be
triggered only by DHCPv4, it cannot be triggered by DHCPv6. This issue
affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: 12.3 versions prior to 12.3R12-S16;

created by Just Works or an authenticated-and-MITM-protection key
created by Passkey Entry, Numeric Comparison or OOB. Assume that a
victim mobile uses secure pairing to pair with a victim BLE device
based on TI chips and generate an authenticated-and-MITM-protection
LTK. If a fake mobile with the victim mobile&#8217;s MAC address uses Just
Works and pairs with the victim device, the generated LTK still has
the property of authenticated-and-MITM-protection. Therefore, the fake
mobile can access attributes with the authenticated read/write

On Juniper Networks MX Series and EX9200 Series, in a certain
condition the IPv6 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection
might not take affect when it reaches the threshold condition. The
DDoS protection allows the device to continue to function while it is
under DDoS attack, protecting both the Routing Engine (RE) and the
Flexible PIC Concentrator (FPC) during the DDoS attack. When this
issue occurs, the RE and/or the FPC can become overwhelmed, which
could disrupt network protocol operations and/or interrupt traffic.
This issue does not affect IPv4 DDoS protection. This issue affects MX
Series and EX9200 Series with Trio-based PFEs (Packet Forwarding

When DNS filtering is enabled on Juniper Networks Junos MX Series with
one of the following cards MS-PIC, MS-MIC or MS-MPC, an incoming
stream of packets processed by the Multiservices PIC Management Daemon
(mspmand) process might be bypassed due to a race condition. Due to
this vulnerability, mspmand process, responsible for managing "URL
Filtering service", can crash, causing the Services PIC to restart.
While the Services PIC is restarting, all PIC services including DNS
filtering service (DNS sink holing) will be bypassed until the
Services PIC completes its boot process. This issue affects Juniper
Networks Junos OS: 17.3 versions prior to 17.3R3-S8; 18.3 versions
prior to 18.3R3-S1; 18.4 versions prior to 18.4R3; 19.1 versions prior

On Juniper Networks EX2300 Series, receipt of a stream of specific
multicast packets by the layer2 interface can cause high CPU load,
which could lead to traffic interruption. This issue occurs when
multicast packets are received by the layer 2 interface. To check if
the device has high CPU load due to this issue, the administrator can
issue the following command: user@host> show chassis routing-engine
Routing Engine status: ... Idle 2 percent the "Idle" value shows as
low (2 % in the example above), and also the following command:
user@host> show system processes summary ... PID USERNAME PRI NICE

Insufficient Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection in Juniper Networks
J-Web and web based (HTTP/HTTPS) services allows an unauthenticated
attacker to hijack the target user's HTTP/HTTPS session and perform
administrative actions on the Junos device as the targeted user. This
issue only affects Juniper Networks Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS
services enabled such as J-Web, Web Authentication, Dynamic-VPN
(DVPN), Firewall Authentication Pass-Through with Web-Redirect, and
Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP). Junos OS devices with HTTP/HTTPS
services disabled are not affected. If HTTP/HTTPS services are
enabled, the following command will show the httpd processes:
user@device> show system processes | match http 5260 - S 0:00.13
/usr/sbin/httpd-gk -N 5797 - I 0:00.10 /usr/sbin/httpd --config
/jail/var/etc/httpd.conf In order to successfully exploit this
vulnerability, the attacker needs to convince the device administrator

On Juniper Networks PTX and QFX Series devices with packet sampling
configured using tunnel-observation mpls-over-udp, sampling of a
malformed packet can cause the Kernel Routing Table (KRT) queue to
become stuck. KRT is the module within the Routing Process Daemon
(RPD) that synchronized the routing tables with the forwarding tables
in the kernel. This table is then synchronized to the Packet
Forwarding Engine (PFE) via the KRT queue. Thus, when KRT queue become
stuck, it can lead to unexpected packet forwarding issues. An
administrator can monitor the following command to check if there is
the KRT queue is stuck: user@device > show krt state ... Number of
async queue entries: 65007 <--- this value keep on increasing. When
this issue occurs, the following message might appear in the

On Juniper Networks MX Series with MS-MIC or MS-MPC card configured
with NAT64 configuration, receipt of a malformed IPv6 packet may crash
the MS-PIC component on MS-MIC or MS-MPC. This issue occurs when a

packet. An unauthenticated attacker can continuously send crafted IPv6
packets through the device causing repetitive MS-PIC process crashes,
resulting in an extended Denial of Service condition. This issue
