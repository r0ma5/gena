If a TLS 1.3 client gets neither a PSK (pre shared key) extension nor
a KSE (key share extension) when connecting to a malicious server, a
default predictable buffer gets used for the IKM (Input Keying
Material) value when generating the session master secret. Using a
potentially known IKM value when generating the session master secret
key compromises the key generated, allowing an eavesdropper to
reconstruct it and potentially allowing access to or meddling with
message contents in the session. This issue does not affect client
validation of connected servers, nor expose private key information,
but could result in an insecure TLS 1.3 session when not controlling
both sides of the connection. wolfSSL recommends that TLS 1.3 client
side users update the version of wolfSSL used.

matrix-react-sdk is a react-based SDK for inserting a Matrix chat/voip
client into a web page. The Export Chat feature includes certain
attacker-controlled elements in the generated document without
sufficient escaping, leading to stored Cross site scripting (XSS).
Since the Export Chat feature generates a separate document, an
attacker can only inject code run from the `null` origin, restricting
the impact. However, the attacker can still potentially use the XSS to
leak message contents. A malicious homeserver is a potential attacker
since the affected inputs are controllable server-side. This issue has
been addressed in commit `22fcd34c60` which is included in release
version 3.76.0. Users are advised to upgrade. The only known
workaround for this issue is to disable or to not use the Export Chat
feature.

OpenComputers is a Minecraft mod that adds programmable computers and
robots to the game. This issue affects every version of OpenComputers
with the Internet Card feature enabled; that is, OpenComputers 1.2.0
until 1.8.3 in their most common, default configurations. If the
OpenComputers mod is installed as part of a Minecraft server hosted on
a popular cloud hosting provider, such as AWS, GCP and Azure, those
metadata services' API endpoints are not forbidden (aka "blacklisted")
by default. As such, any player can gain access to sensitive
information exposed via those metadata servers, potentially allowing
them to pivot or privilege escalate into the hosting provider. In
addition, IPv6 addresses are not correctly filtered at all, allowing
broader access into the local IPv6 network. This can allow a player on
a server using an OpenComputers computer to access parts of the
private IPv4 address space, as well as the whole IPv6 address space,
in order to retrieve sensitive information. OpenComputers v1.8.3 for
Minecraft 1.7.10 and 1.12.2 contains a patch for this issue. Some
workarounds are also available. One may disable the Internet Card
feature completely. If using OpenComputers 1.3.0 or above, using the

Tekton Pipelines project provides k8s-style resources for declaring
CI/CD-style pipelines. Starting in version 0.35.0, pipelines do not
validate child UIDs, which means that a user that has access to create
TaskRuns can create their own Tasks that the Pipelines controller will
accept as the child Task. While the software stores and validates the
PipelineRun's (api version, kind, name, uid) in the child Run's
OwnerReference, it only store (api version, kind, name) in the
ChildStatusReference. This means that if a client had access to create
TaskRuns on a cluster, they could create a child TaskRun for a
pipeline with the same name + owner reference, and the Pipeline
controller picks it up as if it was the original TaskRun. This is
problematic since it can let users modify the config of Pipelines at
runtime, which violates SLSA L2 Service Generated / Non-falsifiable
requirements. This issue can be used to trick the Pipeline controller
into associating unrelated Runs to the Pipeline, feeding its data
through the rest of the Pipeline. This requires access to create
TaskRuns, so impact may vary depending on one Tekton setup. If users
already have unrestricted access to create any Task/PipelineRun, this
does not grant any additional capabilities. As of time of publication,
there are no known patches for this issue.

Winter is a free, open-source content management system (CMS) based on
the Laravel PHP framework. Users with the `backend.manage_branding`
permission can upload SVGs as the application logo. Prior to version
1.2.3, SVG uploads were not sanitized, which could have allowed a
stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. To exploit the
vulnerability, an attacker would already need to have developer or
super user level permissions in Winter CMS. This means they would
already have extensive access and control within the system.
Additionally, to execute the XSS, the attacker would need to convince
the victim to directly visit the URL of the maliciously uploaded SVG,
and the application would have to be using local storage where
uploaded files are served under the same domain as the application
itself instead of a CDN. This is because all SVGs in Winter CMS are
rendered through an `img` tag, which prevents any payloads from being
executed directly. These two factors significantly limit the potential
harm of this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in v1.2.3
through the inclusion of full support for SVG uploads and automatic
sanitization of uploaded SVG files. As a workaround, one may apply the
patches manually.

Piwigo is open source photo gallery software. Prior to version 13.8.0,
there is a SQL Injection vulnerability in the login of the
administrator screen. The SQL statement that acquires the HTTP Header
`User-Agent` is vulnerable at the endpoint that records user
information when logging in to the administrator screen. It is
possible to execute arbitrary SQL statements. Someone who wants to
exploit the vulnerability must be log in to the administrator screen,
even with low privileges. Any SQL statement can be executed. Doing so
may leak information from the database. Version 13.8.0 contains a fix
for this issue. As another mitigation, those who want to execute a SQL
statement verbatim with user-enterable parameters should be sure to
escape the parameter contents appropriately.

RestrictedPython is a tool that helps to define a subset of the Python
language which allows users to provide a program input into a trusted
environment. RestrictedPython does not check access to stack frames
and their attributes. Stack frames are accessible within at least
generators and generator expressions, which are allowed inside
RestrictedPython. Prior to versions 6.1 and 5.3, an attacker with
access to a RestrictedPython environment can write code that gets the
current stack frame in a generator and then walk the stack all the way
beyond the RestrictedPython invocation boundary, thus breaking out of
the restricted sandbox and potentially allowing arbitrary code
execution in the Python interpreter. All RestrictedPython deployments
that allow untrusted users to write Python code in the
RestrictedPython environment are at risk. In terms of Zope and Plone,
this would mean deployments where the administrator allows untrusted
users to create and/or edit objects of type `Script (Python)`, `DTML
Method`, `DTML Document` or `Zope Page Template`. This is a non-
default configuration and likely to be extremely rare. The problem has
been fixed in versions 6.1 and 5.3.

Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the
capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. Running Auto-GPT version
prior to 0.4.3 by cloning the git repo and executing `docker compose
run auto-gpt` in the repo root uses a different docker-compose.yml
file from the one suggested in the official docker set up
instructions. The docker-compose.yml file located in the repo root
mounts itself into the docker container without write protection. This
means that if malicious custom python code is executed via the
`execute_python_file` and `execute_python_code` commands, it can
overwrite the docker-compose.yml file and abuse it to gain control of
the host system the next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been

Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the
capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. When Auto-GPT is executed
directly on the host system via the provided run.sh or run.bat files,
custom Python code execution is sandboxed using a temporary dedicated
docker container which should not have access to any files outside of
the Auto-GPT workspace directory. Before v0.4.3, the
`execute_python_code` command (introduced in v0.4.1) does not sanitize
the `basename` arg before writing LLM-supplied code to a file with an
LLM-supplied name. This allows for a path traversal attack that can
overwrite any .py file outside the workspace directory by specifying a
`basename` such as `../../../main.py`. This can further be abused to
achieve arbitrary code execution on the host running Auto-GPT by e.g.
overwriting autogpt/main.py which will be executed outside of the
docker environment meant to sandbox custom python code execution the
next time Auto-GPT is started. The issue has been patched in version
0.4.3. As a workaround, the risk introduced by this vulnerability can
be remediated by running Auto-GPT in a virtual machine, or another
environment in which damage to files or corruption of the program is
not a critical problem.

Auto-GPT is an experimental open-source application showcasing the
capabilities of the GPT-4 language model. The Auto-GPT command line UI
makes heavy use of color-coded print statements to signify different
types of system messages to the user, including messages that are
crucial for the user to review and control which commands should be
executed. Before v0.4.3, it was possible for a malicious external
resource (such as a website browsed by Auto-GPT) to cause misleading
messages to be printed to the console by getting the LLM to
regurgitate JSON encoded ANSI escape sequences (`\u001b[`). These
escape sequences were JSON decoded and printed to the console as part
of the model's "thinking process". The issue has been patched in
release version 0.4.3.

Vulnerable code is used by aiohttp for its HTTP request parser when
available which is the default case when installing from a wheel. This
vulnerability only affects users of aiohttp as an HTTP server (ie
`aiohttp.Application`), you are not affected by this vulnerability if
you are using aiohttp as an HTTP client library (ie
`aiohttp.ClientSession`). Sending a crafted HTTP request will cause
the server to misinterpret one of the HTTP header values leading to
HTTP request smuggling. This issue has been addressed in version
3.8.5. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade can
reinstall aiohttp using `AIOHTTP_NO_EXTENSIONS=1` as an environment
variable to disable the llhttp HTTP request parser implementation. The
pure Python implementation isn't vulnerable.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. The REST API allows executing all
actions via POST requests and accepts `text/plain`, `multipart/form-
data` or `application/www-form-urlencoded` as content types which can
be sent via regular HTML forms, thus allowing cross-site request
forgery. With the interaction of a user with programming rights, this
allows remote code execution through script macros and thus impacts
the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the whole XWiki
installation. For regular cookie-based authentication, the
vulnerability is mitigated by SameSite cookie restrictions but as of
March 2023, these are not enabled by default in Firefox and Safari.
The vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.8 and 15.2 by
requiring a CSRF token header for certain request types that are
susceptible to CSRF attacks.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/contribsys/faktory/security/advisories/GHSA-x4hh-vjm7-g2jv

Faktory is a language-agnostic persistent background job server. Prior
to version 1.8.0, the Faktory web dashboard can suffer from denial of
service by a crafted malicious url query param `days`. The
vulnerability is related to how the backend reads the `days` URL query
parameter in the Faktory web dashboard. The value is used directly
without any checks to create a string slice. If a very large value is
provided, the backend server ends up using a significant amount of
memory and causing it to crash. Version 1.8.0 fixes this issue.

Contiki-NG is an operating system for internet-of-things devices. In
versions 4.9 and prior, when processing the various IPv6 header fields
during IPHC header decompression, Contiki-NG confirms the received
packet buffer contains enough data as needed for that field. But no
similar check is done before decompressing the IPv6 address.
Therefore, up to 16 bytes can be read out of bounds on the line with
the statement `memcpy(&ipaddr->u8[16 - postcount], iphc_ptr,
postcount);`. The value of `postcount` depends on the address
compression used in the received packet and can be controlled by the
attacker. As a result, an attacker can inject a packet that causes an
out-of-bound read. As of time of publication, a patched version is not
available. As a workaround, one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG
pull request #2509 to patch the system.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20230823 CVE-2023-37379: Apache Airflow: Exposure of sensitive connection information, DOS and SSRF on "test connection" feature
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/23/4

Apache Airflow, in versions prior to 2.7.0, contains a security
vulnerability that can be exploited by an authenticated user
possessing Connection edit privileges. This vulnerability allows the
user to access connection information and exploit the test connection
feature by sending many requests, leading to a denial of service (DoS)
condition on the server. Furthermore, malicious actors can leverage
this vulnerability to establish harmful connections with the server.
Users of Apache Airflow are strongly advised to upgrade to version
2.7.0 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this
vulnerability. Additionally, administrators are encouraged to review
and adjust user permissions to restrict access to sensitive
functionalities, reducing the attack surface.

Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony
toolkit. In Asterisk versions 18.20.0 and prior, 20.5.0 and prior, and
21.0.0; as well as ceritifed-asterisk 18.9-cert5 and prior, the
'update' functionality of the PJSIP_HEADER dialplan function can
exceed the available buffer space for storing the new value of a
header. By doing so this can overwrite memory or cause a crash. This
is not externally exploitable, unless dialplan is explicitly written
to update a header based on data from an outside source. If the
'update' functionality is not used the vulnerability does not occur. A
patch is available at commit a1ca0268254374b515fa5992f01340f7717113fa.

Contiki-NG is an operating system for internet-of-things devices. In
versions 4.9 and prior, when a packet is received, the Contiki-NG
network stack attempts to start the periodic TCP timer if it is a TCP
packet with the SYN flag set. But the implementation does not first
verify that a full TCP header has been received. Specifically, the
implementation attempts to access the flags field from the TCP buffer
in the following conditional expression in the `check_for_tcp_syn`
function. For this reason, an attacker can inject a truncated TCP
packet, which will lead to an out-of-bound read from the packet
buffer. As of time of publication, a patched version is not available.
As a workaround, one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request
#2510 to patch the system.

`Archiver`/`UnArchiver` API. Prior to version 4.8.0, using
AbstractUnArchiver for extracting an archive might lead to an
arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution. When
extracting an archive with an entry that already exists in the
destination directory as a symbolic link whose target does not exist -
the `resolveFile()` function will return the symlink's source instead
of its target, which will pass the verification that ensures the file
will not be extracted outside of the destination directory. Later
`Files.newOutputStream()`, that follows symlinks by default, will
actually write the entry's content to the symlink's target. Whoever
uses plexus archiver to extract an untrusted archive is vulnerable to
an arbitrary file creation and possibly remote code execution. Version
4.8.0 contains a patch for this issue.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. Improper escaping in the document
`SkinsCode.XWikiSkinsSheet` leads to an injection vector from view
right on that document to programming rights, or in other words, it is
possible to execute arbitrary script macros including Groovy and
Python macros that allow remote code execution including unrestricted
read and write access to all wiki contents. The attack works by
opening a non-existing page with a name crafted to contain a dangerous
payload. It is possible to check if an existing installation is
vulnerable. See the linked GHSA for instructions on testing an
installation. This issue has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8, 14.10.4 and
15.0-rc-1. Users are advised to upgrade. The fix commit `d9c88ddc` can
also be applied manually to the impacted document
`SkinsCode.XWikiSkinsSheet` and users unable to upgrade are advised to
manually patch their installations.

OpenIDC/cjose is a C library implementing the Javascript Object
Signing and Encryption (JOSE). The AES GCM decryption routine
incorrectly uses the Tag length from the actual Authentication Tag
provided in the JWE. The spec says that a fixed length of 16 octets
must be applied. Therefore this bug allows an attacker to provide a
truncated Authentication Tag and to modify the JWE accordingly. Users
should upgrade to a version >= 0.6.2.2. Users unable to upgrade should
avoid using AES GCM encryption and replace it with another encryption
algorithm (e.g. AES CBC).

Discourse is an open source discussion platform. Prior to version
3.1.0.beta7 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, a CSP (Content
Security Policy) nonce reuse vulnerability was discovered could allow
cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks to bypass CSP protection for
anonymous (i.e. unauthenticated) users. There are no known XSS vectors
at the moment, but should one be discovered, this vulnerability would
allow the XSS attack to bypass CSP and execute successfully. This
vulnerability isn't applicable to logged-in users. Version 3.1.0.beta7
contains a patch. The stable branch doesn't have this vulnerability. A
workaround to prevent the vulnerability is to disable Google Tag

Metabase is an open-source business intelligence and analytics
platform. Prior to versions 0.43.7.3, 0.44.7.3, 0.45.4.3, 0.46.6.4,
1.43.7.3, 1.44.7.3, 1.45.4.3, and 1.46.6.4, a vulnerability could
potentially allow remote code execution on one's Metabase server. The
core issue is that one of the supported data warehouses (an embedded
in-memory database H2), exposes a number of ways for a connection
string to include code that is then executed by the process running
the embedded database. Because Metabase allows users to connect to
databases, this means that a user supplied string can be used to
inject executable code. Metabase allows users to validate their
connection string before adding a database (including on setup), and
this validation API was the primary vector used as it can be called
without validation. Versions 0.43.7.3, 0.44.7.3, 0.45.4.3, 0.46.6.4,
1.43.7.3, 1.44.7.3, 1.45.4.3, and 1.46.6.4 fix this issue by removing
the ability of users to add H2 databases entirely. As a workaround, it
is possible to block these vulnerabilities at the network level by
blocking the endpoints `POST /api/database`, `PUT /api/database/:id`,
and `POST /api/setup/validateuntil`. Those who use H2 as a file-based
database should migrate to SQLite.

Open Enclave is a hardware-agnostic open source library for developing
applications that utilize Hardware-based Trusted Execution
Environments, also known as Enclaves. There are two issues that are
mitigated in version 0.19.3. First, Open Enclave SDK does not properly
sanitize the `MXCSR` register on enclave entry. This makes
applications vulnerable to MXCSR Configuration Dependent Timing (MCDT)
attacks, where incorrect `MXCSR` values can impact instruction
retirement by at most one cycle, depending on the (secret) data
operand value. Please find more details in the guidance from Intel in
the references. Second, Open Enclave SDK does not sanitize x86's
alignment check flag `RFLAGS.AC` on enclave entry. This opens up the
possibility for a side-channel attacker to be notified for every
unaligned memory access performed by the enclave. The issue has been
addressed in version 0.19.3 and the current master branch. Users will
need to recompile their applications against the patched libraries to
be protected from this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds

Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing data
privacy requests and privacy regulations. The Fides webserver is
vulnerable to a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Attackers can
exploit a weakness in the connector template upload feature to upload
a malicious zip bomb file, resulting in resource exhaustion and
service unavailability for all users of the Fides webserver. This
vulnerability affects Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.15.1`.
Exploitation is limited to users with elevated privileges with the
`CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` scope, which includes root users and
users with the owner role. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides
version `2.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or
later to secure their systems against this threat. There is no known
workaround to remediate this vulnerability without upgrading. If an
attack occurs, the impact can be mitigated by manually or
automatically restarting the affected container.

Incorrect Authorization vulnerability in Apache Software Foundation
Apache Pulsar Function Worker. This issue affects Apache Pulsar:
before 2.10.4, and 2.11.0. Any authenticated user can retrieve a
source's configuration or a sink's configuration without
authorization. Many sources and sinks contain credentials in the
configuration, which could lead to leaked credentials. This
vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that there is not a known way
for an authenticated user to enumerate another tenant's sources or
sinks, meaning the source or sink name would need to be guessed in
order to exploit this vulnerability. The recommended mitigation for
impacted users is to upgrade the Pulsar Function Worker to a patched
version. 2.10 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least
2.10.4. 2.11 Pulsar Function Worker users should upgrade to at least
2.11.1. 3.0 Pulsar Function Worker users are unaffected. Any users
running the Pulsar Function Worker for 2.9.* and earlier should
upgrade to one of the above patched versions.

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched: cls_fw
component can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. If
tcf_change_indev() fails, fw_set_parms() will immediately return an

tcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can control the reference counter
and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to be freed, leading
to a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend upgrading past commit

The Essential Addons For Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
to unauthenticated API key disclosure in versions up to, and
including, 5.8.1 due to the plugin adding the API key to the source
code of any page running the MailChimp block. This makes it possible
for unauthenticated attackers to obtain a site's MailChimp API key. We
recommend resetting any MailChimp API keys if running a vulnerable
version of this plugin with the MailChimp block enabled as the API key
may have been compromised. This only affects sites running the premium
version of the plugin and that have the Mailchimp block enabled on a
page.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20230725 CVE-2023-37895: Apache Jackrabbit RMI access can lead to RCE
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/25/8

Java object deserialization issue in Jackrabbit webapp/standalone on
all platforms allows attacker to remotely execute code via RMIVersions
up to (including) 2.20.10 (stable branch) and 2.21.17 (unstable
branch) use the component "commons-beanutils", which contains a class
that can be used for remote code execution over RMI. Users are advised
to immediately update to versions 2.20.11 or 2.21.18. Note that
earlier stable branches (1.0.x .. 2.18.x) have been EOLd already and
do not receive updates anymore. In general, RMI support can expose
vulnerabilities by the mere presence of an exploitable class on the
classpath. Even if Jackrabbit itself does not contain any code known
to be exploitable anymore, adding other components to your server can
expose the same type of problem. We therefore recommend to disable RMI
access altogether (see further below), and will discuss deprecating
RMI support in future Jackrabbit releases. How to check whether RMI
support is enabledRMI support can be over an RMI-specific TCP port,
and over an HTTP binding. Both are by default enabled in Jackrabbit
webapp/standalone. The native RMI protocol by default uses port 1099.
To check whether it is enabled, tools like "netstat" can be used to
check. RMI-over-HTTP in Jackrabbit by default uses the path "/rmi". So
when running standalone on port 8080, check whether an HTTP GET
request on localhost:8080/rmi returns 404 (not enabled) or 200
(enabled). Note that the HTTP path may be different when the webapp is
deployed in a container as non-root context, in which case the prefix
is under the user's control. Turning off RMIFind web.xml (either in
JAR/WAR file or in unpacked web application folder), and remove the
declaration and the mapping definition for the RemoteBindingServlet:
<servlet> <servlet-name>RMI</servlet-name> <servlet-class>org.apache.j
ackrabbit.servlet.remote.RemoteBindingServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet> <servlet-mapping> <servlet-name>RMI</servlet-name> <url-
pattern>/rmi</url-pattern> </servlet-mapping> Find the
bootstrap.properties file (in $REPOSITORY_HOME), and set
rmi.enabled=false and also remove rmi.host rmi.port rmi.url-pattern If
there is no file named bootstrap.properties in $REPOSITORY_HOME, it is
located somewhere in the classpath. In this case, place a copy in
$REPOSITORY_HOME and modify it as explained.

Nuclei is a vulnerability scanner. Prior to version 2.9.9, a security
issue in the Nuclei project affected users utilizing Nuclei as Go code
(SDK) running custom templates. This issue did not affect CLI users.
The problem was related to sanitization issues with payload loading in
sandbox mode. There was a potential risk with payloads loading in
sandbox mode. The issue occurred due to relative paths not being
converted to absolute paths before doing the check for `sandbox` flag
allowing arbitrary files to be read on the filesystem in certain cases
when using Nuclei from `Go` SDK implementation. This issue has been
fixed in version 2.9.9. The maintainers have also enabled sandbox by
default for filesystem loading. This can be optionally disabled if
required. The `-sandbox` option has been deprecated and is now divided
into two new options: `-lfa` (allow local file access) which is
enabled by default and `-lna` (restrict local network access) which
can be enabled by users optionally. The `-lfa` allows file (payload)
access anywhere on the system (disabling sandbox effectively), and
`-lna` blocks connections to the local/private network.

Grav is a file-based Web-platform built in PHP. Grav is subject to a
server side template injection (SSTI) vulnerability. The fix for
another SSTI vulnerability using `|map`, `|filter` and `|reduce` twigs
implemented in the commit `71bbed1` introduces bypass of the denylist
due to incorrect return value from `isDangerousFunction()`, which
allows to execute the payload prepending double backslash (`\\`). The
`isDangerousFunction()` check in version 1.7.42 and onwards retuns
`false` value instead of `true` when the `\` symbol is found in the

Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes
without needing to write code. In versions prior to 1.11.5, 1.12.3,
and 1.13.0, a high-privileged user could create a Package referencing
an arbitrarily large image containing that Crossplane would then
parse, possibly resulting in exhausting all the available memory and
therefore in the container being OOMKilled. The impact is limited due
to the high privileges required to be able to create the Package and
the eventually consistency nature of controller. This issue is fixed
in versions 1.11.5, 1.12.3, and 1.13.0.

Indico is an open source a general-purpose, web based event management
tool. There is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability in confirmation
prompts commonly used when deleting content from Indico. Exploitation
requires someone with at least submission privileges (such as a
speaker) and then someone else to attempt to delete this content.
Considering that event organizers may want to delete suspicious-
looking content when spotting it, there is a non-negligible risk of
such an attack to succeed. The risk of this could be further increased
when combined with some some social engineering pointing the victim
towards this content. Users need to update to Indico 3.2.6 as soon as
possible. See the docs for instructions on how to update. Users who
cannot upgrade should only let trustworthy users manage categories,
create events or upload materials ("submission" privileges on a
contribution/event). This should already be the case in a properly-
configured setup when it comes to category/event management. Note that
a conference doing a Call for Abstracts actively invites external
speakers (who the organizers may not know and thus cannot fully trust)
to submit content, hence the need to update to a a fixed version ASAP
in particular when using such workflows.

Vyper is a Pythonic programming language that targets the Ethereum
Virtual Machine (EVM). Prior to version 0.3.10, the ecrecover
precompile does not fill the output buffer if the signature does not
verify. However, the ecrecover builtin will still return whatever is
at memory location 0. This means that the if the compiler has been
convinced to write to the 0 memory location with specially crafted
data (generally, this can happen with a hashmap access or immutable
read) just before the ecrecover, a signature check might pass on an
invalid signature. Version 0.3.10 contains a patch for this issue.

XWiki Rendering is a generic Rendering system that converts textual
input in a given syntax into another syntax. The cleaning of
attributes during XHTML rendering, introduced in version 14.6-rc-1,
allowed the injection of arbitrary HTML code and thus cross-site
scripting via invalid attribute names. This can be exploited, e.g.,
via the link syntax in any content that supports XWiki syntax like
comments in XWiki. When a user moves the mouse over a malicious link,
the malicious JavaScript code is executed in the context of the user
session. When this user is a privileged user who has programming
rights, this allows server-side code execution with programming
rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity and availability of
the XWiki instance. While this attribute was correctly recognized as
not allowed, the attribute was still printed with a prefix `data-
xwiki-translated-attribute-` without further cleaning or validation.
This problem has been patched in XWiki 14.10.4 and 15.0 RC1 by
removing characters not allowed in data attributes and then validating
the cleaned attribute again. There are no known workarounds apart from
upgrading to a version including the fix.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. Starting in version 9.4-rc-1 and
prior to versions 14.10.8 and 15.3-rc-1, when a document has been
deleted and re-created, it is possible for users with view right on
the re-created document but not on the deleted document to view the
contents of the deleted document. Such a situation might arise when
rights were added to the deleted document. This can be exploited
through the diff feature and, partially, through the REST API by using
versions such as `deleted:1` (where the number counts the deletions in
the wiki and is thus guessable). Given sufficient rights, the attacker
can also re-create the deleted document, thus extending the scope to
any deleted document as long as the attacker has edit right in the
location of the deleted document. This vulnerability has been patched
in XWiki 14.10.8 and 15.3 RC1 by properly checking rights when deleted
revisions of a document are accessed. The only workaround is to
regularly clean deleted documents to minimize the potential exposure.
Extra care should be taken when deleting sensitive documents that are
protected individually (and not, e.g., by being placed in a protected
space) or deleting a protected space as a whole.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. Starting in version
3.5-milestone-1 and prior to versions 14.10.8 and 15.3-rc-1,
triggering the office converter with a specially crafted file name
allows writing the attachment's content to an attacker-controlled
location on the server as long as the Java process has write access to
that location. In particular in the combination with attachment
moving, a feature introduced in XWiki 14.0, this is easy to reproduce
but it also possible to reproduce in versions as old as XWiki 3.5 by
uploading the attachment through the REST API which doesn't remove `/`
or `\` from the filename. As the mime type of the attachment doesn't
matter for the exploitation, this could e.g., be used to replace the
`jar`-file of an extension which would allow executing arbitrary Java
code and thus impact the confidentiality, integrity and availability
of the XWiki installation. This vulnerability has been patched in
XWiki 14.10.8 and 15.3RC1. There are no known workarounds apart from

authentication are encouraged to upgrade Dapr to 1.10.9 or to 1.11.2.
This vulnerability impacts Dapr users who have configured API token
authentication. An attacker could craft a request that is always
allowed by the Dapr sidecar over HTTP, even if the `dapr-api-token` in
the request is invalid or missing. The issue has been fixed in Dapr
1.10.9 or to 1.11.2. There are no known workarounds for this

unauthorized login. Now we have fixed this issue and now user must
have the correct login to access workbench. This issue affects Apache
Submarine: from 0.7.0 before 0.8.0. We recommend that all submarine
users with 0.7.0 upgrade to 0.8.0, which not only fixes the issue,
supports the oidc authentication mode, but also removes the case of
unauthenticated logins. If using the version lower than 0.8.0 and not
want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR

When curl retrieves an HTTP response, it stores the incoming headers
so that they can be accessed later via the libcurl headers API.
However, curl did not have a limit in how many or how large headers it
would accept in a response, allowing a malicious server to stream an

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be
very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions
DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key
or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or
parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted
source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check()
performs various checks on DH parameters. After fixing CVE-2023-3446
it was discovered that a large q parameter value can also trigger an
overly long computation during some of these checks. A correct q
value, if present, cannot be larger than the modulus p parameter, thus
it is unnecessary to perform these checks if q is larger than p. An
application that calls DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters
obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of
Service attack. The function DH_check() is itself called by a number
of other OpenSSL functions. An application calling any of those other
functions may similarly be affected. The other functions affected by
this are DH_check_ex() and EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are
the OpenSSL dhparam and pkeyparam command line applications when using
the "-check" option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not
affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not
affected by this issue.

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/issues/3191
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/coreruleset/coreruleset/pull/3237

coreruleset (aka OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set) through 3.3.4 does
not detect multiple Content-Type request headers on some platforms.
This might allow attackers to bypass a WAF with a crafted payload, aka
"Content-Type confusion" between the WAF and the backend application.
This occurs when the web application relies on only the last Content-
Type header. Other platforms may reject the additional Content-Type
header or merge conflicting headers, leading to detection as a
malformed header.

In PHP versions 8.0.* before 8.0.30, 8.1.* before 8.1.22, and 8.2.*
before 8.2.8 various XML functions rely on libxml global state to
track configuration variables, like whether external entities are
loaded. This state is assumed to be unchanged unless the user
explicitly changes it by calling appropriate function. However, since
the state is process-global, other modules - such as ImageMagick - may
also use this library within the same process, and change that global
state for their internal purposes, and leave it in a state where
external entities loading is enabled. This can lead to the situation
where external XML is parsed with external entities loaded, which can
lead to disclosure of any local files accessible to PHP. This
vulnerable state may persist in the same process across many requests,
until the process is shut down.

PTC&#8217;s KEPServerEX Versions 6.0 to 6.14.263 are vulnerable to being
made to read a recursively defined object that leads to uncontrolled
resource consumption. KEPServerEX uses OPC UA, a protocol which
defines various object types that can be nested to create complex
arrays. It does not implement a check to see if such an object is
recursively defined, so an attack could send a maliciously created
message that the decoder would try to decode until the stack

Omnis Studio 10.22.00 has incorrect access control. It advertises an
irreversible feature for locking classes within Omnis libraries: it
should be no longer possible to delete, view, change, copy, rename,
duplicate, or print a locked class. Due to implementation issues,
locked classes in Omnis libraries can be unlocked, and thus further
analyzed and modified by Omnis Studio. This allows for further

The PKCS#11 feature in ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.3p2 has an
insufficiently trustworthy search path, leading to remote code
execution if an agent is forwarded to an attacker-controlled system.
(Code in /usr/lib is not necessarily safe for loading into ssh-agent.)

CVE-2016-10009.

HedgeDoc is software for creating real-time collaborative markdown
notes. Prior to version 1.9.9, the API of HedgeDoc 1 can be used to
create notes with an alias matching the ID of existing notes. The
affected existing note can then not be accessed anymore and is
effectively hidden by the new one. When the freeURL feature is enabled
(by setting the `allowFreeURL` config option or the
`CMD_ALLOW_FREEURL` environment variable to `true`), any user with the
appropriate permissions can create a note by making a POST request to
the `/new/<ALIAS>` API endpoint. The `<ALIAS>` parameter can be set to
the ID of an existing note. HedgeDoc did not verify whether the
provided `<ALIAS>` value corresponds to a valid ID of an existing note
and always allowed creation of the new note. When a visitor tried to
access the existing note, HedgeDoc will first search for a note with a
matching alias before it searches using the ID, therefore only the new
note can be accessed. Depending on the permission settings of the
HedgeDoc instance, the issue can be exploited only by logged-in users
or by all (including non-logged-in) users. The exploit requires
knowledge of the ID of the target note. Attackers could use this issue
to present a manipulated copy of the original note to the user, e.g.
by replacing the links with malicious ones. Attackers can also use
this issue to prevent access to the original note, causing a denial of
service. No data is lost, as the original content of the affected
notes is still present in the database. This issue was fixed in
version 1.9.9. As a workaround, disabling freeURL mode prevents the
exploitation of this issue. The impact can be limited by restricting
freeURL note creation to trusted, logged-in users by enabling
`requireFreeURLAuthentication`/`CMD_REQUIRE_FREEURL_AUTHENTICATION`.

Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions
prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 affects all
Kirby sites that might have potential attackers in the group of
authenticated Panel users or that allow external visitors to update a
Kirby content file (e.g. via a contact or comment form). Kirby sites
are *not* affected if they don't allow write access for untrusted
users or visitors. A field injection in a content storage
implementation is a type of vulnerability that allows attackers with
content write access to overwrite content fields that the site
developer didn't intend to be modified. In a Kirby site this can be
used to alter site content, break site behavior or inject malicious
data or code. The exact security risk depends on the field type and
usage. Kirby stores content of the site, of pages, files and users in
text files by default. The text files use Kirby's KirbyData format
where each field is separated by newlines and a line with four dashes
(`----`). When reading a KirbyData file, the affected code first
removed the Unicode BOM sequence from the file contents and afterwards
split the content into fields by the field separator. When writing to
a KirbyData file, field separators in field data are escaped to
prevent user input from interfering with the field structure. However
this escaping could be tricked by including a Unicode BOM sequence in
a field separator (e.g. `--\xEF\xBB\xBF--`). When writing, this was
not detected as a separator, but because the BOM was removed during
reading, it could be abused by attackers to inject other field data
into content files. Because each field can only be defined once per
content file, this vulnerability only affects fields in the content
file that were defined above the vulnerable user-writable field or not
at all. Fields that are defined below the vulnerable field override
the injected field content and were therefore already protected. The
problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1,
and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have
fixed the affected code to only remove the Unicode BOM sequence at the
beginning of the file. This fixes this vulnerability both for newly
written as well as for existing content files.

Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions
prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 affects all
Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are
disabled in the config). It can only be abused if a Kirby user is
logged in on a device or browser that is shared with potentially
untrusted users or if an attacker already maliciously used a previous
password to log in to a Kirby site as the affected user. Insufficient
Session Expiration is when a web site permits an attacker to reuse old
session credentials or session IDs for authorization. In the variation
described in this advisory, it allows attackers to stay logged in to a
Kirby site on another device even if the logged in user has since
changed their password. Kirby did not invalidate user sessions that
were created with a password that was since changed by the user or by
a site admin. If a user changed their password to lock out an attacker
who was already in possession of the previous password or of a login
session on another device or browser, the attacker would not be
reliably prevented from accessing the Kirby site as the affected user.
The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2,
3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers
have updated the authentication implementation to keep track of the
hashed password in each active session. If the password changed since
the login, the session is invalidated. To enforce this fix even if the
vulnerability was previously abused, all users are logged out from the
Kirby site after updating to one of the patched releases.

Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions
prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 only affects
Kirby sites that use the `Xml` data handler (e.g.
`Data::decode($string, 'xml')`) or the `Xml::parse()` method in site
or plugin code. The Kirby core does not use any of the affected
methods. XML External Entities (XXE) is a little used feature in the
XML markup language that allows to include data from external files in
an XML structure. If the name of the external file can be controlled
by an attacker, this becomes a vulnerability that can be abused for
various system impacts like the disclosure of internal or confidential
data that is stored on the server (arbitrary file disclosure) or to
perform network requests on behalf of the server (server-side request
forgery, SSRF). Kirby's `Xml::parse()` method used PHP's
`LIBXML_NOENT` constant, which enabled the processing of XML external
entities during the parsing operation. The `Xml::parse()` method is
used in the `Xml` data handler (e.g. `Data::decode($string, 'xml')`).
Both the vulnerable method and the data handler are not used in the
Kirby core. However they may be used in site or plugin code, e.g. to
parse RSS feeds or other XML files. If those files are of an external
origin (e.g. uploaded by a user or retrieved from an external URL),
attackers may be able to include an external entity in the XML file
that will then be processed in the parsing process. Kirby sites that
don't use XML parsing in site or plugin code are *not* affected. The
problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1,
and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have
removed the `LIBXML_NOENT` constant as processing of external entities
is out of scope of the parsing logic. This protects all uses of the
method against the described vulnerability.

Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions
prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 affects all
Kirby sites that might have potential attackers in the group of
authenticated Panel users or that allow external visitors to upload an
arbitrary file to the content folder. Kirby sites are not affected if
they don't allow file uploads for untrusted users or visitors or if
the file extensions of uploaded files are limited to a fixed safe
list. The attack requires user interaction by another user or visitor
and cannot be automated. An editor with write access to the Kirby
Panel could upload a file with an unknown file extension like `.xyz`
that contains HTML code including harmful content like `<script>`
tags. The direct link to that file could be sent to other users or
visitors of the site. If the victim opened that link in a browser
where they are logged in to Kirby and the file had not been opened by
anyone since the upload, Kirby would not be able to send the correct
MIME content type, instead falling back to `text/html`. The browser
would then run the script, which could for example trigger requests to
Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim. The issue was caused
by the underlying `Kirby\Http\Response::file()` method, which didn't
have an explicit fallback if the MIME type could not be determined
from the file extension. If you use this method in site or plugin
code, these uses may be affected by the same vulnerability. The
problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1,
and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have
fixed the affected method to use a fallback MIME type of `text/plain`
and set the `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header if the MIME type
of the file is unknown.

Kirby is a content management system. A vulnerability in versions
prior to 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3, 3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6 affects all
Kirby sites with user accounts (unless Kirby's API and Panel are
disabled in the config). The real-world impact of this vulnerability
is limited, however we still recommend to update to one of the patch
releases because they also fix more severe vulnerabilities. Kirby's
authentication endpoint did not limit the password length. This
allowed attackers to provide a password with a length up to the
server's maximum request body length. Validating that password against
the user's actual password requires hashing the provided password,
which requires more CPU and memory resources (and therefore processing
time) the longer the provided password gets. This could be abused by
an attacker to cause the website to become unresponsive or
unavailable. Because Kirby comes with a built-in brute force
protection, the impact of this vulnerability is limited to 10 failed
logins from each IP address and 10 failed logins for each existing
user per hour. The problem has been patched in Kirby 3.5.8.3, 3.6.6.3,
3.7.5.2, 3.8.4.1, and 3.9.6. In all of the mentioned releases, the
maintainers have added password length limits in the affected code so
that passwords longer than 1000 bytes are immediately blocked, both
when setting a password and when logging in.

Crossplane is a framework for building cloud native control planes
without needing to write code. In versions prior to 1.11.5, 1.12.3,
and 1.13.0, Crossplane's image backend does not validate the byte
contents of Crossplane packages. As such, Crossplane does not detect
if an attacker has tampered with a Package. The problem has been fixed
in 1.11.5, 1.12.3 and 1.13.0. As a workaround, only use images from
trusted sources and keep Package editing/creating privileges to
administrators only.

Apptainer is an open source container platform. Version 1.2.0-rc.2
introduced an ineffective privilege drop when requesting container
network setup, therefore subsequent functions are called with root
privileges, the attack surface is rather limited for users but an
attacker could possibly craft a starter config to delete any directory
on the host filesystems. A security fix has been included in Apptainer
1.2.1. There is no known workaround outside of upgrading to Apptainer
1.2.1.

Cargo downloads the Rust project&#8217;s dependencies and compiles the
project. Cargo prior to version 0.72.2, bundled with Rust prior to
version 1.71.1, did not respect the umask when extracting crate
archives on UNIX-like systems. If the user downloaded a crate
containing files writeable by any local user, another local user could
exploit this to change the source code compiled and executed by the
current user. To prevent existing cached extractions from being
exploitable, the Cargo binary version 0.72.2 included in Rust 1.71.1
or later will purge caches generated by older Cargo versions
automatically. As a workaround, configure one's system to prevent
other local users from accessing the Cargo directory, usually located
in `~/.cargo`.

TYPO3 HTML Sanitizer is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP, aiming to
provide cross-site-scripting-safe markup based on explicitly allowed
tags, attributes and values. Starting in version 1.0.0 and prior to
versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2, due to an encoding issue in the
serialization layer, malicious markup nested in a `noscript` element
was not encoded correctly. `noscript` is disabled in the default
configuration, but might have been enabled in custom scenarios. This
allows bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of TYPO3 HTML
Sanitizer. Versions 1.5.1 and 2.1.2 fix the problem.

copyparty is file server software. Prior to version 1.8.7, the
application contains a reflected cross-site scripting via URL-
parameter `?k304=...` and `?setck=...`. The worst-case outcome of this
is being able to move or delete existing files on the server, or
upload new files, using the account of the person who clicks the
malicious link. It is recommended to change the passwords of one's
copyparty accounts, unless one have inspected one's logs and found no
trace of attacks. Version 1.8.7 contains a patch for the issue.

collection but out-of-the box the `directus_users` collection is
configured with such a permissions filter allowing you to get updates
for other users when changes happen. Version 10.5.0 contains a patch.

DietPi-Dashboard is a web dashboard for the operating system DietPi.
The dashboard only allows for one TLS handshake to be in process at a
given moment. Once a TCP connection is established in HTTPS mode, it
will assume that it should be waiting for a handshake, and will stay
this way indefinitely until a handshake starts or some error occurs.
In version 0.6.1, this can be exploited by simply not starting the
handshake, preventing any other TLS handshakes from getting through.
An attacker can lock the dashboard in a state where it is waiting for
a TLS handshake from the attacker, who won't provide it. This prevents
any legitimate traffic from getting to the dashboard, and can last
indefinitely. Version 0.6.2 has a patch for this issue. As a
workaround, do not use HTTPS mode on the open internet where anyone
can connect. Instead, put a reverse proxy in front of the dashboard,
and have it handle any HTTPS connections.

version 14.11.99.28 and Tuleap Enterprise Edition prior to versions
14.10-6 and 14.11-3, the preview of an artifact link with a type does
not respect the project, tracker and artifact level permissions. The
issue occurs on the artifact view (not reproducible on the artifact
modal). Users might get access to information they should not have
access to. Only the title, status, assigned to and last update date
fields as defined by the semantics are impacted. If those fields have
strict permissions (e.g. the title is only visible to a specific user
group) those permissions are still enforced. Tuleap Community Edition
14.11.99.28, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 14.10-6, and Tuleap Enterprise
Edition 14.11-3 contain a fix for this issue.

Tolgee is an open-source localization platform. Starting in version
3.14.0 and prior to version 3.23.1, when a request is made using an
API key, the backend fails to verify the permission scopes associated
with the key, effectively bypassing permission checks entirely for
some endpoints. It's important to note that this vulnerability only
affects projects that have inadvertently exposed their API keys on the
internet. Projects that have kept their API keys secure are not
impacted. This issue is fixed in version 3.23.1.

This flaw makes curl overflow a heap based buffer in the SOCKS5 proxy
handshake. When curl is asked to pass along the host name to the
SOCKS5 proxy to allow that to resolve the address instead of it
getting done by curl itself, the maximum length that host name can be
is 255 bytes. If the host name is detected to be longer, curl switches
to local name resolving and instead passes on the resolved address
only. Due to this bug, the local variable that means "let the host
resolve the name" could get the wrong value during a slow SOCKS5
handshake, and contrary to the intention, copy the too long host name
to the target buffer instead of copying just the resolved address
there. The target buffer being a heap based buffer, and the host name
coming from the URL that curl has been told to operate with.

This flaw allows an attacker to insert cookies at will into a running
program using libcurl, if the specific series of conditions are met.
libcurl performs transfers. In its API, an application creates "easy
handles" that are the individual handles for single transfers. libcurl
provides a function call that duplicates en easy handle called [curl_e
asy_duphandle](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/curl_easy_duphandle.html). If
a transfer has cookies enabled when the handle is duplicated, the
cookie-enable state is also cloned - but without cloning the actual
cookies. If the source handle did not read any cookies from a specific
file on disk, the cloned version of the handle would instead store the
file name as `none` (using the four ASCII letters, no quotes).
Subsequent use of the cloned handle that does not explicitly set a
source to load cookies from would then inadvertently load cookies from
a file named `none` - if such a file exists and is readable in the
current directory of the program using libcurl. And if using the
correct file format of course.

Sydent is an identity server for the Matrix communications protocol.
Prior to version 2.5.6, if configured to send emails using TLS, Sydent
does not verify SMTP servers' certificates. This makes Sydent's emails
vulnerable to interception via a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
Attackers with privileged access to the network can intercept room
invitations and address confirmation emails. This is patched in Sydent
2.5.6. When patching, make sure that Sydent trusts the certificate of
the server it is connecting to. This should happen automatically when
using properly issued certificates. Those who use self-signed
certificates should make sure to copy their Certification Authority
certificate, or their self signed certificate if using only one, to
the trust store of your operating system. As a workaround, one can
ensure Sydent's emails fail to send by setting the configured SMTP
server to a loopback or non-routable address under one's control which
does not have a listening SMTP server.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/mskocik/svelecte/security/advisories/GHSA-7h45-grc5-89wq

Svelecte is a flexible autocomplete/select component written in
Svelte. Svelecte item names are rendered as raw HTML with no escaping.
This allows the injection of arbitrary HTML into the Svelecte
dropdown. This can be exploited to execute arbitrary JavaScript
whenever a Svelecte dropdown is opened. Item names given to Svelecte
appear to be directly rendered as HTML by the default item renderer.
This means that any HTML tags in the name are rendered as HTML
elements not as text. Note that the custom item renderer shown in
https://mskocik.github.io/svelecte/#item-rendering is also vulnerable
to the same exploit. Any site that uses Svelecte with dynamically
created items either from an external source or from user-created
content could be vulnerable to an XSS attack (execution of untrusted
JavaScript), clickjacking or any other attack that can be performed
with arbitrary HTML injection. The actual impact of this vulnerability
for a specific application depends on how trustworthy the sources that
provide Svelecte items are and the steps that the application has
taken to mitigate XSS attacks. XSS attacks using this vulnerability
are mostly mitigated by a Content Security Policy that blocks inline
JavaScript. This issue has been addressed in version 3.16.3. Users are
advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

Logistics Pipes is a modification (a.k.a. mod) for the computer game
Minecraft Java Edition. The mod used Java's
`ObjectInputStream#readObject` on untrusted data coming from clients
or servers over the network resulting in possible remote code
execution when sending specifically crafted network packets after
connecting. The affected versions were released between 2013 and 2016
and the issue (back then unknown) was fixed in 2016 by a refactoring
of the network IO code. The issue is present in all Logistics Pipes
versions ranged from 0.7.0.91 prior to 0.10.0.71, which were
downloaded from different platforms summing up to multi-million
downloads. For Minecraft version 1.7.10 the issue was fixed in build
0.10.0.71. Everybody on Minecraft 1.7.10 should check their version
number of Logistics Pipes in their modlist and update, if the version
number is smaller than 0.10.0.71. Any newer supported Minecraft
version (like 1.12.2) never had a Logistics Pipes version with
vulnerable code. The best available workaround for vulnerable versions
is to play in singleplayer only or update to newer Minecraft versions
and modpacks.

matrix-appservice-irc is a Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix. Prior to
version 1.0.1, it is possible to craft a command with newlines which
would not be properly parsed. This would mean you could pass a string

matrix-appservice-bridge provides an API for setting up bridges.
Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1, a
malicious Matrix server can use a foreign user's MXID in an OpenID
exchange, allowing a bad actor to impersonate users when using the
provisioning API. The library does not check that the servername part
of the `sub` parameter (containing the user's *claimed* MXID) is the
the same as the servername we are talking to. A malicious actor could
spin up a server on any given domain, respond with a `sub` parameter
according to the user they want to act as and use the resulting token
to perform provisioning requests. Versions 8.1.2 and 9.0.1 contain a
patch. As a workaround, disable the provisioning API.

protocol-http1 provides a low-level implementation of the HTTP/1
protocol. RFC 9112 Section 7.1 defined the format of chunk size, chunk
data and chunk extension. The value of Content-Length header should be
a string of 0-9 digits, the chunk size should be a string of hex
digits and should split from chunk data using CRLF, and the chunk
extension shouldn't contain any invisible character. However, Falcon
has following behaviors while disobey the corresponding RFCs:
accepting Content-Length header values that have `+` prefix, accepting
Content-Length header values that written in hexadecimal with `0x`
prefix, accepting `0x` and `+` prefixed chunk size, and accepting LF
in chunk extension. This behavior can lead to desync when forwarding
through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially results in HTTP request
smuggling and firewall bypassing. This issue is fixed in `protocol-
http1` v0.15.1. There are no known workarounds.

Ethereum Name Service (ENS) is a distributed, open, and extensible
naming system based on the Ethereum blockchain. According to the
documentation, controllers are allowed to register new domains and
extend the expiry of existing domains, but they cannot change the
ownership or reduce the expiration time of existing domains. However,
a preliminary analysis suggests that an attacker-controlled controller
may be able to reduce the expiration time of existing domains due to
an integer overflow in the renew function. The vulnerability resides
`@ensdomains/ens-contracts` prior to version 0.0.22. If successfully
exploited, this vulnerability would enable attackers to force the
expiration of any ENS record, ultimately allowing them to claim the
affected domains for themselves. Currently, it would require a
malicious DAO to exploit it. Nevertheless, any vulnerability present
in the controllers could potentially render this issue exploitable in
the future. An additional concern is the possibility of renewal
discounts. Should ENS decide to implement a system that offers
unlimited .eth domains for a fixed fee in the future, the
vulnerability could become exploitable by any user due to the reduced
attack cost. Version 0.0.22 contains a patch for this issue. As long
as registration cost remains linear or superlinear based on
registration duration, or limited to a reasonable maximum (eg, 1
million years), this vulnerability could only be exploited by a
malicious DAO. The interim workaround is thus to take no action.

Hydra is the layer-two scalability solution for Cardano. Users of the
Hydra head protocol send the UTxOs they wish to commit into the Hydra
head first to the `commit` validator, where they remain until they are
either collected into the `head` validator or the protocol
initialisation is aborted and the value in the committed UTxOs is
returned to the users who committed them. Prior to version 0.12.0, the
`commit` validator contains a flawed check when the `ViaAbort`
redeemer is used, which allows any user to spend any UTxO which is at
the validator arbitrarily, meaning an attacker can steal the funds
that users are trying to commit into the head validator. The intended
behavior is that the funds must be returned to the user which
committed the funds and can only be performed by a participant of the
head. The `initial` validator also is similarly affected as the same
flawed check is performed for the `ViaAbort` redeemer. Due to this
issue, an attacker can steal any funds that user's try to commit into
a Hydra head. Also, an attacker can prevent any Hydra head from being
successfully opened. It does not allow an attacker to take funds which

Knowage is an open source analytics and business intelligence suite.
Starting in the 6.x.x branch and prior to version 8.1.8, the endpoint
`/knowage/restful-services/dossier/importTemplateFile` allows
authenticated users to upload `template file` on the server, but does
not need any authorization to be reached. When the JSP file is
uploaded, the attacker just needs to connect to
`/knowageqbeengine/foo.jsp` to gain code execution on the server. By
exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker with low privileges can
upload a JSP file to the `knowageqbeengine` directory and gain code
execution capability on the server. This issue has been patched in
Knowage version 8.1.8.

PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library
written in C with high level API in C, C++, Java, C#, and Python
languages. SRTP is a higher level media transport which is stacked
upon a lower level media transport such as UDP and ICE. Currently a
higher level transport is not synchronized with its lower level
transport that may introduce use-after-free issue. This vulnerability
affects applications that have SRTP capability (`PJMEDIA_HAS_SRTP` is
set) and use underlying media transport other than UDP. This
vulnerability&#8217;s impact may range from unexpected application
termination to control flow hijack/memory corruption. The patch is
available as a commit in the master branch.

import-in-the-middle is a module loading interceptor specifically for
ESM modules. The import-in-the-middle loader works by generating a
wrapper module on the fly. The wrapper uses the module specifier to
load the original module and add some wrapping code. Prior to version
1.4.2, it allows for remote code execution in cases where an
application passes user-supplied input directly to the `import()`
function. This vulnerability has been patched in import-in-the-middle
version 1.4.2. Some workarounds are available. Do not pass any user-
supplied input to `import()`. Instead, verify it against a set of
allowed values. If using import-in-the-middle, directly or indirectly,
and support for EcmaScript Modules is not needed, ensure that no
options are set, either via command-line or the `NODE_OPTIONS`
environment variable, that would enable loader hooks.

Pandoc before 3.1.6 allows arbitrary file write: this can be triggered
by providing a crafted image element in the input when generating
files via the --extract-media option or outputting to PDF format. This
allows an attacker to create or overwrite arbitrary files, depending
on the privileges of the process running Pandoc. It only affects
systems that pass untrusted user input to Pandoc and allow Pandoc to
be used to produce a PDF or with the --extract-media option. NOTE:
this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-35936
(failure to properly account for double encoded path names).

RARLAB WinRAR before 6.23 allows attackers to execute arbitrary code
when a user attempts to view a benign file within a ZIP archive. The
issue occurs because a ZIP archive may include a benign file (such as
an ordinary .JPG file) and also a folder that has the same name as the
benign file, and the contents of the folder (which may include
executable content) are processed during an attempt to access only the
benign file. This was exploited in the wild in April through October
2023.

Name: CVE-2023-38898
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/105987

** DISPUTED ** An issue in Python cpython v.3.7 allows an attacker to
obtain sensitive information via the _asyncio._swap_current_task
component. NOTE: this is disputed by the vendor because (1) neither
3.7 nor any other release is affected (it is a bug in some 3.12 pre-
releases); (2) there are no common scenarios in which an adversary can
call _asyncio._swap_current_task but does not already have the ability
to call arbitrary functions; and (3) there are no common scenarios in
which sensitive information, which is not already accessible to an
adversary, becomes accessible through this bug.

A vulnerability was found in subscription-manager that allows local
privilege escalation due to inadequate authorization. The D-Bus
interface com.redhat.RHSM1 exposes a significant number of methods to
all users that could change the state of the registration. By using
the com.redhat.RHSM1.Config.SetAll() method, a low-privileged local
user could tamper with the state of the registration, by unregistering
the system or by changing the current entitlements. This flaw allows
an attacker to set arbitrary configuration directives for
/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf, which can be abused to cause a local privilege
escalation to an unconfined root.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/07/2

Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Ozone. The
vulnerability allows an attacker to download metadata internal to the
Storage Container Manager service without proper authentication. The
attacker is not allowed to do any modification within the Ozone
Storage Container Manager service using this vulnerability. The
accessible metadata does not contain sensitive information that can be
used to exploit the system later on, and the accessible data does not
make it possible to gain access to actual user data within Ozone. This
issue affects Apache Ozone: 1.2.0 and subsequent releases up until
1.3.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 1.4.0, which fixes
the issue.

QUIC connections do not set an upper bound on the amount of data
buffered when reading post-handshake messages, allowing a malicious
QUIC connection to cause unbounded memory growth. With fix,
connections now consistently reject messages larger than 65KiB in

Line directives ("//line") can be used to bypass the restrictions on
"//go:cgo_" directives, allowing blocked linker and compiler flags to
be passed during compilation. This can result in unexpected execution
of arbitrary code when running "go build". The line directive requires
the absolute path of the file in which the directive lives, which
makes exploiting this issue significantly more complex.

A malicious HTTP/2 client which rapidly creates requests and
immediately resets them can cause excessive server resource
consumption. While the total number of requests is bounded by the
http2.Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting, resetting an in-progress
request allows the attacker to create a new request while the existing
one is still executing. With the fix applied, HTTP/2 servers now bound
the number of simultaneously executing handler goroutines to the
stream concurrency limit (MaxConcurrentStreams). New requests arriving
when at the limit (which can only happen after the client has reset an
existing, in-flight request) will be queued until a handler exits. If
the request queue grows too large, the server will terminate the
connection. This issue is also fixed in golang.org/x/net/http2 for
users manually configuring HTTP/2. The default stream concurrency
limit is 250 streams (requests) per HTTP/2 connection. This value may
be adjusted using the golang.org/x/net/http2 package; see the
Server.MaxConcurrentStreams setting and the ConfigureServer function.

A malicious HTTP sender can use chunk extensions to cause a receiver
reading from a request or response body to read many more bytes from
the network than are in the body. A malicious HTTP client can further
exploit this to cause a server to automatically read a large amount of
data (up to about 1GiB) when a handler fails to read the entire body
of a request. Chunk extensions are a little-used HTTP feature which
permit including additional metadata in a request or response body
sent using the chunked encoding. The net/http chunked encoding reader
discards this metadata. A sender can exploit this by inserting a large
metadata segment with each byte transferred. The chunk reader now
produces an error if the ratio of real body to encoded bytes grows too
small.

Various `node:fs` functions allow specifying paths as either strings
or `Uint8Array` objects. In Node.js environments, the `Buffer` class
extends the `Uint8Array` class. Node.js prevents path traversal
through strings (see CVE-2023-30584) and `Buffer` objects (see
CVE-2023-32004), but not through non-`Buffer` `Uint8Array` objects.
This is distinct from CVE-2023-32004 which only referred to `Buffer`
objects. However, the vulnerability follows the same pattern using
`Uint8Array` instead of `Buffer`. Please note that at the time this
CVE was issued, the permission model is an experimental feature of
Node.js.

Dangerzone is software for converting potentially dangerous PDFs,
office documents, or images to safe PDFs. The Dangerzone CLI
(`dangerzone-cli` command) logs output from the container where the
file sanitization takes place, to the user's terminal. Prior to
version 0.4.2, if the container is compromised and can return
attacker-controlled strings, then the attacker may be able to spoof
messages in the user's terminal or change the window title. Besides
logging output from containers, it also logs the names of the files it
sanitizes. If these files contain ANSI escape sequences, then the same
issue applies. Dangerzone is predominantly a GUI application, so this
issue should leave most of our users unaffected. Nevertheless, we
always suggest updating to the newest version. This issue is fixed in
Dangerzone 0.4.2.

Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an
eBPF-based dataplane. An attacker with the ability to update pod
labels can cause Cilium to apply incorrect network policies. This
issue arises due to the fact that on pod update, Cilium incorrectly
uses user-provided pod labels to select the policies which apply to
the workload in question. This can affect Cilium network policies that
use the namespace, service account or cluster constructs to restrict
traffic, Cilium clusterwide network policies that use Cilium namespace
labels to select the Pod and Kubernetes network policies. Non-existent
construct names can be provided, which bypass all network policies
applicable to the construct. For example, providing a pod with a non-
existent namespace as the value of the `io.kubernetes.pod.namespace`
label results in none of the namespaced CiliumNetworkPolicies applying
to the pod in question. This attack requires the attacker to have
Kubernetes API Server access, as described in the Cilium Threat Model.
This issue has been resolved in: Cilium versions 1.14.2, 1.13.7, and
1.12.14. Users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround an admission
webhook can be used to prevent pod label updates to the
`k8s:io.kubernetes.pod.namespace` and `io.cilium.k8s.policy.*` keys.

Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform.
Log output when updating GitHub status is improperly set to FULL
always. It's recommended to apply the patch and rotate the GitHub
token used for github status notifications. Given that this would
output github tokens to a log system, the risk is slightly higher than
a "low" since token exposure could grant elevated access to
repositories outside of control. If using READ restricted tokens, the
exposure is such that the token itself could be used to access
resources otherwise restricted from reads. This only affects users of
GitHub Status Notifications. This issue has been addressed in pull
request 1316. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
should disable GH Status Notifications, Filter their logs for Echo log
data and use read-only tokens that are limited in scope.

Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform.
Starting in version 22.1.0 and prior to version 23.7.2, an attacker
with access to a token with few or no scopes can query `/api/0/api-
tokens/` for a list of all tokens created by a user, including tokens
with greater scopes, and use those tokens in other requests. There is
no evidence that the issue was exploited on `sentry.io`. For self-
hosted users, it is advised to rotate user auth tokens. A fix is
available in version 23.7.2 of `sentry` and `self-hosted`. There are
no known workarounds.

subject to a Null Pointer Dereference leading a crash in the RemoteFX
(rfx) handling. Inside the `rfx_process_message_tileset` function, the
program allocates tiles using `rfx_allocate_tiles` for the number of
numTiles. If the initialization process of tiles is not completed for
various reasons, tiles will have a NULL pointer. Which may be accessed
in further processing and would cause a program crash. This issue has

the value `multi_opaque_rect->numRectangles` is less than 45. Looping
through `multi_opaque_rect->`numRectangles without proper boundary
checks can lead to Out-of-Bounds Read errors which will likely lead to
a crash. This issue has been addressed in versions 2.11.0 and
3.0.0-beta3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
framework. A defect in the sql_save function was discovered. When the
column type is numeric, the sql_save function directly utilizes user
input. Many files and functions calling the sql_save function do not
perform prior validation of user input, leading to the existence of
multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in Cacti. This allows
authenticated users to exploit these SQL injection vulnerabilities to
perform privilege escalation and remote code execution. This issue has
been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are advised to upgrade. There
are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM). In versions 0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0, named re-entrancy
locks are allocated incorrectly. Each function using a named re-
entrancy lock gets a unique lock regardless of the key, allowing
cross-function re-entrancy in contracts compiled with the susceptible
versions. A specific set of conditions is required to result in
misbehavior of affected contracts, specifically: a `.vy` contract
compiled with `vyper` versions `0.2.15`, `0.2.16`, or `0.3.0`; a
primary function that utilizes the `@nonreentrant` decorator with a
specific `key` and does not strictly follow the check-effects-
interaction pattern (i.e. contains an external call to an untrusted
party before storage updates); and a secondary function that utilizes
the same `key` and would be affected by the improper state caused by
the primary function. Version 0.3.1 contains a fix for this issue.

Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
framework. In Cacti 1.2.24, users with console access can be
redirected to an arbitrary website after a change password performed
via a specifically crafted URL. The `auth_changepassword.php` file
accepts `ref` as a URL parameter and reflects it in the form used to
perform the change password. It's value is used to perform a redirect
via `header` PHP function. A user can be tricked in performing the
change password operation, e.g., via a phishing message, and then
interacting with the malicious website where the redirection has been
performed, e.g., downloading malwares, providing credentials, etc.

the data source management information (e.g. data source path, polling
configuration etc.) for different data visualizations of the _cacti_
app. CENSUS found that an adversary that is able to configure a
malicious Device name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user
of the same (or broader) privileges. A user that possesses the

Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-
Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability allows an authenticated user to poison
data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be viewed by
administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code in the
victim's browser at view-time. The`reports_admin.php` script displays
reporting information about graphs, devices, data sources etc. CENSUS
found that an adversary that is able to configure a malicious Device
name, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any user of the same (or
broader) privileges. A user that possesses the _General
Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the
device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through
`http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload
is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/reports_admin.php` when the a
graph with the maliciously altered device name is linked to the
report. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users
are advised to upgrade. Users unable to update should manually filter
HTML output.

Cacti is an open source operational monitoring and fault management
framework. Affected versions are subject to a Stored Cross-Site-
Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability which allows an authenticated user to
poison data stored in the _cacti_'s database. These data will be
viewed by administrative _cacti_ accounts and execute JavaScript code
in the victim's browser at view-time. The script under
`reports_admin.php` displays reporting information about graphs,
devices, data sources etc. _CENSUS_ found that an adversary that is
able to configure a malicious device name, related to a graph attached
to a report, can deploy a stored XSS attack against any super user who
has privileges of viewing the `reports_admin.php` page, such as
administrative accounts. A user that possesses the _General
Administration>Sites/Devices/Data_ permissions can configure the
device names in _cacti_. This configuration occurs through
`http://<HOST>/cacti/host.php`, while the rendered malicious payload
is exhibited at `http://<HOST>/cacti/reports_admin.php` when the a
graph with the maliciously altered device name is linked to the
report. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.25. Users are
advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should manually filter
HTML output.

allows local privilege escalation for low privileged users, via the
`repair` function. The problem occurs as the repair function of the
MSI is spawning an SYSTEM Powershell without the `-NoProfile`

goauthentik is an open-source Identity Provider. In affected versions
using a recovery flow with an identification stage an attacker is able
to determine if a username exists. Only setups configured with a
recovery flow are impacted by this. Anyone with a user account on a
system with the recovery flow described above is susceptible to having
their username/email revealed as existing. An attacker can easily
enumerate and check users' existence using the recovery flow, as a
clear message is shown when a user doesn't exist. Depending on
configuration this can either be done by username, email, or both.
This issue has been addressed in versions 2023.5.6 and 2023.6.2. Users
are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

ScanCode.io is a server to script and automate software composition
analysis with ScanPipe pipelines. Prior to version 32.5.1, the
software has a possible command injection vulnerability in the docker
fetch process as it allows to append malicious commands in the
`docker_reference` parameter. In the function
`scanpipe/pipes/fetch.py:fetch_docker_image` the parameter
`docker_reference` is user controllable. The `docker_reference`
variable is then passed to the vulnerable function
`get_docker_image_platform`. However, the `get_docker_image_plaform`
function constructs a shell command with the passed
`docker_reference`. The `pipes.run_command` then executes the shell
command without any prior sanitization, making the function vulnerable
to command injections. A malicious user who is able to create or add
inputs to a project can inject commands. Although the command
injections are blind and the user will not receive direct feedback
without logs, it is still possible to cause damage to the
server/container. The vulnerability appears for example if a malicious
user adds a semicolon after the input of `docker://;`, it would allow
appending malicious commands. Version 32.5.1 contains a patch for this
issue. The `docker_reference` input should be sanitized to avoid
command injections and, as a workaround, one may avoid creating
commands with user controlled input directly.

Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform.
Starting in version 10.0.0 and prior to version 23.7.2, an attacker
with sufficient client-side exploits could retrieve a valid access
token for another user during the OAuth token exchange due to
incorrect credential validation. The client ID must be known and the
API application must have already been authorized on the targeted user
account. Sentry SaaS customers do not need to take any action. Self-
hosted installations should upgrade to version 23.7.2 or higher. There
are no direct workarounds, but users should review applications
authorized on their account and remove any that are no longer needed.

SES is a JavaScript environment that allows safe execution of
arbitrary programs in Compartments. In version 0.18.0 prior to 0.18.7,
0.17.0 prior to 0.17.1, 0.16.0 prior to 0.16.1, 0.15.0 prior to
0.15.24, 0.14.0 prior to 0.14.5, an 0.13.0 prior to 0.13.5, there is a
hole in the confinement of guest applications under SES that may
manifest as either the ability to exfiltrate information or execute
arbitrary code depending on the configuration and implementation of
the surrounding host. Guest program running inside a Compartment with
as few as no endowments can gain access to the surrounding host&#8217;s
dynamic import by using dynamic import after the spread operator, like
`{...import(arbitraryModuleSpecifier)}`. On the web or in web
extensions, a Content-Security-Policy following ordinary best
practices likely mitigates both the risk of exfiltration and execution
of arbitrary code, at least limiting the modules that the attacker can
import to those that are already part of the application. However,
without a Content-Security-Policy, dynamic import can be used to issue
HTTP requests for either communication through the URL or for the
execution of code reachable from that origin. Within an XS worker, an
attacker can use the host&#8217;s module system to the extent that the host
has been configured. This typically only allows access to module code
on the host&#8217;s file system and is of limited use to an attacker. Within
Node.js, the attacker gains access to Node.js&#8217;s module system.
Importing the powerful builtins is not useful except insofar as there
are side-effects and tempered because dynamic import returns a
promise. Spreading a promise into an object renders the promises
useless. However, Node.js allows importing data URLs, so this is a
clear path to arbitrary execution. Versions 0.18.7, 0.17.1, 0.16.1,
0.15.24, 0.14.5, and 0.13.5 contain a patch for this issue. Some
workarounds are available. On the web, providing a suitably
constrained Content-Security-Policy mitigates most of the threat. With
XS, building a binary that lacks the ability to load modules at
runtime mitigates the entirety of the threat. That will look like an
implementation of `fxFindModule` in a file like `xsPlatform.c` that
calls `fxRejectModuleFile`.

go-libp2p is the Go implementation of the libp2p Networking Stack.
Prior to versions 0.27.8, 0.28.2, and 0.29.1 malicious peer can use
large RSA keys to run a resource exhaustion attack & force a node to
spend time doing signature verification of the large key. This
vulnerability is present in the core/crypto module of go-libp2p and
can occur during the Noise handshake and the libp2p x509 extension
verification step. To prevent this attack, go-libp2p versions 0.27.8,
0.28.2, and 0.29.1 restrict RSA keys to <= 8192 bits. To protect one's
application, it is necessary to update to these patch releases and to
use the updated Go compiler in 1.20.7 or 1.19.12. There are no known
workarounds for this issue.

Reference: URL:https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2023-3961.html

A path traversal vulnerability was identified in Samba when processing
client pipe names connecting to Unix domain sockets within a private
directory. Samba typically uses this mechanism to connect SMB clients
to remote procedure call (RPC) services like SAMR LSA or SPOOLSS,
which Samba initiates on demand. However, due to inadequate
sanitization of incoming client pipe names, allowing a client to send
a pipe name containing Unix directory traversal characters (../). This
could result in SMB clients connecting as root to Unix domain sockets
outside the private directory. If an attacker or client managed to
send a pipe name resolving to an external service using an existing
Unix domain socket, it could potentially lead to unauthorized access
to the service and consequential adverse events, including compromise
or service crashes.

A vulnerability was found in insights-client. This security issue
occurs because of insecure file operations or unsafe handling of
temporary files and directories that lead to local privilege
escalation. Before the insights-client has been registered on the
system by root, an unprivileged local user or attacker could create
the /var/tmp/insights-client directory (owning the directory with
read, write, and execute permissions) on the system. After the
insights-client is registered by root, an attacker could then control
the directory content that insights are using by putting malicious
scripts into it and executing arbitrary code as root (trivially
bypassing SELinux protections because insights processes are allowed
to disable SELinux system-wide).

Several plugins for WordPress by Inisev are vulnerable to Cross-Site
Request Forgery to unauthorized installation of plugins due to a
missing nonce check on the handle_installation function that is called
via the inisev_installation AJAX aciton in various versions. This
makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to install plugins
from the limited list via a forged request granted they can trick a
site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
link.

Reference: MISC:https://security.ts.fujitsu.com/ProductSecurity/content/Fujitsu-PSIRT-ISS-IS-2023-071410-Security-Notice.pdf

An issue was discovered in Fujitsu Software Infrastructure Manager
(ISM) before 2.8.0.061. The ismsnap component (in this specific case
at /var/log/fujitsu/ServerViewSuite/ism/FirmwareManagement/FirmwareMan
agement.log) allows insecure collection and storage of authorization
credentials in cleartext. That occurs when users perform any ISM
Firmware Repository Address setup test (Test the Connection), or
regularly authorize against an already configured remote firmware
repository site, as set up in ISM Firmware Repository Address. A
privileged attacker is therefore able to potentially gather the
associated ismsnap maintenance data, in the same manner as a trusted
party allowed to export ismsnap data from ISM. The preconditions for
an ISM installation to be generally vulnerable are that the Download
Firmware (Firmware Repository Server) function is enabled and
configured, and that the character \ (backslash) is used in a user
credential (i.e., user/ID or password) of the remote proxy host /
firmware repository server. NOTE: this may overlap CVE-2023-39379.

The cryptocurrency wallet entropy seeding mechanism used in Libbitcoin
Explorer 3.0.0 through 3.6.0 is weak, aka the Milk Sad issue. The use
of an mt19937 Mersenne Twister PRNG restricts the internal entropy to
32 bits regardless of settings. This allows remote attackers to
recover any wallet private keys generated from "bx seed" entropy
output and steal funds. (Affected users need to move funds to a secure
new cryptocurrency wallet.) NOTE: the vendor's position is that there
was sufficient documentation advising against "bx seed" but others
disagree. NOTE: this was exploited in the wild in June and July 2023.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20231108 CVE-2023-39913: Apache UIMA Java SDK, Apache UIMA Java SDK, Apache UIMA Java SDK, Apache UIMA Java SDK: Potential untrusted code execution when deserializing certain binary CAS formats
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/08/1

Deserialization of Untrusted Data, Improper Input Validation
vulnerability in Apache UIMA Java SDK, Apache UIMA Java SDK, Apache
UIMA Java SDK, Apache UIMA Java SDK.This issue affects Apache UIMA
Java SDK: before 3.5.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version
3.5.0, which fixes the issue. There are several locations in the code
where serialized Java objects are deserialized without verifying the
data. This affects in particular: * the deserialization of a Java-
serialized CAS, but also other binary CAS formats that include TSI
information using the CasIOUtils class; * the CAS Editor Eclipse
plugin which uses the the CasIOUtils class to load data; * the
deserialization of a Java-serialized CAS of the Vinci Analysis Engine
service which can receive using Java-serialized CAS objects over
network connections; * the CasAnnotationViewerApplet and the
CasTreeViewerApplet; * the checkpointing feature of the CPE module.
Note that the UIMA framework by default does not start any remotely
accessible services (i.e. Vinci) that would be vulnerable to this
issue. A user or developer would need to make an active choice to
start such a service. However, users or developers may use the
CasIOUtils in their own applications and services to parse serialized
CAS data. They are affected by this issue unless they ensure that the
data passed to CasIOUtils is not a serialized Java object. When using
Vinci or using CasIOUtils in own services/applications, the
unrestricted deserialization of Java-serialized CAS files may allow
arbitrary (remote) code execution. As a remedy, it is possible to set
up a global or context-specific ObjectInputFilter (cf.
https://openjdk.org/jeps/290 and https://openjdk.org/jeps/415 ) if
running UIMA on a Java version that supports it. Note that Java 1.8
does not support the ObjectInputFilter, so there is no remedy when
running on this out-of-support platform. An upgrade to a recent Java
version is strongly recommended if you need to secure an UIMA version
that is affected by this issue. To mitigate the issue on a Java 9+
platform, you can configure a filter pattern through the
"jdk.serialFilter" system property using a semicolon as a separator:
To allow deserializing Java-serialized binary CASes, add the classes:
* org.apache.uima.cas.impl.CASCompleteSerializer *
org.apache.uima.cas.impl.CASMgrSerializer *
org.apache.uima.cas.impl.CASSerializer * java.lang.String To allow
deserializing CPE Checkpoint data, add the following classes (and any
custom classes your application uses to store its checkpoints): *
org.apache.uima.collection.impl.cpm.CheckpointData *
org.apache.uima.util.ProcessTrace *
org.apache.uima.util.impl.ProcessTrace_impl *
org.apache.uima.collection.base_cpm.SynchPoint Make sure to use "!*"
as the final component to the filter pattern to disallow
deserialization of any classes not listed in the pattern. Apache UIMA
3.5.0 uses tightly scoped ObjectInputFilters when reading Java-
serialized data depending on the type of data being expected.
Configuring a global filter is not necessary with this version.

eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution
Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions
2.11.1, 2.10.2, 2.9.2, and 2.6.6, heap can be overflowed by providing
a PID_PROPERTY_LIST parameter that contains a CDR string with length
larger than the size of actual content. In
`eprosima::fastdds::dds::ParameterPropertyList_t::push_back_helper`,
`memcpy` is called to first copy the octet'ized length and then to
copy the data into `properties_.data`. At the second memcpy, both
`data` and `size` can be controlled by anyone that sends the CDR
string to the discovery multicast port. This can remotely crash any
Fast-DDS process. Versions 2.11.1, 2.10.2, 2.9.2, and 2.6.6 contain a
patch for this issue.

efibootguard is a simple UEFI boot loader with support for safely
switching between current and updated partition sets. Insufficient or
missing validation and sanitization of input from untrustworthy
bootloader environment files can cause crashes and probably also code
injections into `bg_setenv`) or programs using `libebgenv`. This is
triggered when the affected components try to modify a manipulated
environment, in particular its user variables. Furthermore,
`bg_printenv` may crash over invalid read accesses or report invalid
results. Not affected by this issue is EFI Boot Guard's bootloader EFI
binary. EFI Boot Guard release v0.15 contains required patches to
sanitize and validate the bootloader environment prior to processing
it in userspace. Its library and tools should be updated, so should
programs statically linked against it. An update of the bootloader EFI
executable is not required. The only way to prevent the issue with an
unpatched EFI Boot Guard version is to avoid accesses to user
variables, specifically modifications to them.

OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation provides OpenTelemetry auto-
instrumentation and instrumentation libraries for Java. OpenTelemetry
Java Instrumentation prior to version 1.28.0 contains an issue related
to the instrumentation of Java applications using the AWS SDK v2 with
Amazon Simple Email Service (SES) v1 API. When SES POST requests are
instrumented, the query parameters of the request are inserted into
the trace `url.path` field. This behavior leads to the http body,
containing the email subject and message, to be present in the trace
request url metadata. Any user using a version before 1.28.0 of
OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation to instrument AWS SDK v2 call to
SES&#8217;s v1 SendEmail API is affected. The e-mail content sent to SES may
end up in telemetry backend. This exposes the e-mail content to
unintended audiences. The issue can be mitigated by updating
OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation to version 1.28.0 or later.

Electron is a framework which lets you write cross-platform desktop
applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. Electron apps that are
launched as command line executables are impacted. Specifically this
issue can only be exploited if the following conditions are met: 1.
The app is launched with an attacker-controlled working directory and
2. The attacker has the ability to write files to that working
directory. This makes the risk quite low, in fact normally issues of
this kind are considered outside of our threat model as similar to
Chromium we exclude Physically Local Attacks but given the ability for
this issue to bypass certain protections like ASAR Integrity it is
being treated with higher importance. This issue has been fixed in
versions:`26.0.0-beta.13`, `25.4.1`, `24.7.1`, `23.3.13`, and
`22.3.19`. There are no app side workarounds, users must update to a
patched version of Electron.

1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance
management panel. In version 1.4.3, arbitrary file reads allow an
attacker to read arbitrary important configuration files on the
server. In the `api/v1/file.go` file, there is a function called
`LoadFromFile`, which directly reads the file by obtaining the
requested path `parameter[path]`. The request parameters are not
filtered, resulting in a background arbitrary file reading
vulnerability. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue.

1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance
management panel. In version 1.4.3, authenticated attackers can
download arbitrary files through the API interface. This code has
unauthorized access. Attackers can freely download the file content on
the target system. This may cause a large amount of information
leakage. Version 1.5.0 has a patch for this issue.

1Panel is an open source Linux server operation and maintenance
management panel. In version 1.4.3, an arbitrary file write
vulnerability could lead to direct control of the server. In the
`api/v1/file.go` file, there is a function called `SaveContentthat,It
`recieves JSON data sent by users in the form of a POST request. And
the lack of parameter filtering allows for arbitrary file write
operations. Version 1.5.0 contains a patch for this issue.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock/security/advisories/GHSA-676j-xrv3-73vc

WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. When certain request
URLs like &#8220;@127.0.0.1:1234" are used in WireMock Studio configuration
fields, the request might be forwarded to an arbitrary service
reachable from WireMock&#8217;s instance. There are 3 identified potential
attack vectors: via &#8220;TestRequester&#8221; functionality, webhooks and the
proxy mode. As we can control HTTP Method, HTTP Headers, HTTP Data, it
allows sending requests with the default level of credentials for the
WireMock instance. The vendor has discontinued the affected Wiremock
studio product and there will be no fix. Users are advised to find
alternatives.

jupyter-server is the backend for Jupyter web applications. Open
Redirect Vulnerability. Maliciously crafted login links to known
Jupyter Servers can cause successful login or an already logged-in
session to be redirected to arbitrary sites, which should be
restricted to Jupyter Server-served URLs. This issue has been
addressed in commit `29036259` which is included in release 2.7.2.
Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

uthenticode is a small cross-platform library for partially verifying
Authenticode digital signatures. Version 1.0.9 of uthenticode hashed
the entire file rather than hashing sections by virtual address, in
violation of the Authenticode specification. As a result, an attacker
could modify code within a binary without changing its Authenticode
hash, making it appear valid from uthenticode's perspective. Versions
of uthenticode prior to 1.0.9 are not vulnerable to this attack, nor
are versions in the 2.x series. By design, uthenticode does not
perform full-chain validation. However, the malleability of signature
verification introduced in 1.0.9 was an unintended oversight. The 2.x
series addresses the vulnerability. Versions prior to 1.0.9 are also
not vulnerable, but users are encouraged to upgrade rather than
downgrade. There are no workarounds to this vulnerability.
