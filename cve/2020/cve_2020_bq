stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg
vorbis files. A crafted file may trigger out of bounds write in
`f->vendor[len] = (char)'\0';`. The root cause is that if `len` read
in `start_decoder` is a negative number and `setup_malloc`
successfully allocates memory in that case, but memory write is done
with a negative index `len`. Similarly if len is INT_MAX the integer
overflow len+1 happens in `f->vendor = (char*)setup_malloc(f,
sizeof(char) * (len+1));` and `f->comment_list[i] =
(char*)setup_malloc(f, sizeof(char) * (len+1));`. This issue may lead
to code execution.

stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg
vorbis files. A crafted file may trigger memory write past an
allocated heap buffer in `start_decoder`. The root cause is a
potential integer overflow in `sizeof(char*) *
(f->comment_list_length)` which may make `setup_malloc` allocate less
memory than required. Since there is another integer overflow an
attacker may overflow it too to force `setup_malloc` to return 0 and
make the exploit more reliable. This issue may lead to code execution.

github.com/crewjam/saml is a saml library for the go language. In
affected versions the package does not validate the ACS Location URI
according to the SAML binding being parsed. If abused, this flaw
allows attackers to register malicious Service Providers at the IdP
and inject Javascript in the ACS endpoint definition, achieving Cross-
Site-Scripting (XSS) in the IdP context during the redirection at the
end of a SAML SSO Flow. Consequently, an attacker may perform any
authenticated action as the victim once the victim&#8217;s browser loaded
the SAML IdP initiated SSO link for the malicious service provider.
Note: SP registration is commonly an unrestricted operation in IdPs,
hence not requiring particular permissions or publicly accessible to
ease the IdP interoperability. This issue is fixed in version 0.4.14.
Users unable to upgrade may perform external validation of URLs
provided in SAML metadata, or restrict the ability for end-users to
upload arbitrary metadata.

Reference: MISC:https://advisory.splunk.com/advisories/SVD-2023-0810
Reference: URL:https://advisory.splunk.com/advisories/SVD-2023-0810

In Splunk IT Service Intelligence (ITSI) versions below below 4.13.3,
4.15.3, or 4.17.1, a malicious actor can inject American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) escape codes into Splunk ITSI log files
that, when a vulnerable terminal application reads them, can run
malicious code in the vulnerable application. This attack requires a
user to use a terminal application that translates ANSI escape codes
to read the malicious log file locally in the vulnerable terminal. The
vulnerability also requires additional user interaction to succeed.
The vulnerability does not directly affect Splunk ITSI. The indirect
impact on Splunk ITSI can vary significantly depending on the
permissions in the vulnerable terminal application, as well as where
and how the user reads the malicious log file. For example, users can
copy the malicious file from Splunk ITSI and read it on their local
machine.

Design document functions which receive a user http request object may
expose authorization or session cookie headers of the user who
accesses the document. These design document functions are: * list *
show * rewrite * update An attacker can leak the session component
using an HTML-like output, insert the session as an external resource
(such as an image), or store the credential in a _local document with
an "update" function. For the attack to succeed the attacker has to be
able to insert the design documents into the database, then manipulate
a user to access a function from that design document. Workaround:
Avoid using design documents from untrusted sources which may attempt
to access or manipulate request object's headers

When a HTTP/2 stream was reset (RST frame) by a client, there was a
time window were the request's memory resources were not reclaimed
immediately. Instead, de-allocation was deferred to connection close.
A client could send new requests and resets, keeping the connection
busy and open and causing the memory footprint to keep on growing. On
connection close, all resources were reclaimed, but the process might
run out of memory before that. This was found by the reporter during
testing of CVE-2023-44487 (HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Exploit) with their own
test client. During "normal" HTTP/2 use, the probability to hit this
bug is very low. The kept memory would not become noticeable before
the connection closes or times out. Users are recommended to upgrade
to version 2.4.58, which fixes the issue.

urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3
previously wouldn't remove the HTTP request body when an HTTP redirect
response using status 301, 302, or 303 after the request had its
method changed from one that could accept a request body (like `POST`)
to `GET` as is required by HTTP RFCs. Although this behavior is not
specified in the section for redirects, it can be inferred by piecing
together information from different sections and we have observed the
behavior in other major HTTP client implementations like curl and web
browsers. Because the vulnerability requires a previously trusted
service to become compromised in order to have an impact on
confidentiality we believe the exploitability of this vulnerability is
low. Additionally, many users aren't putting sensitive data in HTTP
request bodies, if this is the case then this vulnerability isn't
exploitable. Both of the following conditions must be true to be
affected by this vulnerability: 1. Using urllib3 and submitting
sensitive information in the HTTP request body (such as form data or
JSON) and 2. The origin service is compromised and starts redirecting
using 301, 302, or 303 to a malicious peer or the redirected-to
service becomes compromised. This issue has been addressed in versions
1.26.18 and 2.0.7 and users are advised to update to resolve this
issue. Users unable to update should disable redirects for services
that aren't expecting to respond with redirects with `redirects=False`
and disable automatic redirects with `redirects=False` and handle 301,
302, and 303 redirects manually by stripping the HTTP request body.

pdm is a Python package and dependency manager supporting the latest
PEP standards. It's possible to craft a malicious `pdm.lock` file that
could allow e.g. an insider or a malicious open source project to
appear to depend on a trusted PyPI project, but actually install
another project. A project `foo` can be targeted by creating the
project `foo-2` and uploading the file `foo-2-2.tar.gz` to pypi.org.
PyPI will see this as project `foo-2` version `2`, while PDM will see
this as project `foo` version `2-2`. The version must only be
`parseable as a version` and the filename must be a prefix of the
project name, but it's not verified to match the version being
installed. Version `2-2` is also not a valid normalized version per
PEP 440. Matching the project name exactly (not just prefix) would fix
the issue. When installing dependencies with PDM, what's actually
installed could differ from what's listed in `pyproject.toml`
(including arbitrary code execution on install). It could also be used
for downgrade attacks by only changing the version. This issue has
been addressed in commit `6853e2642df` which is included in release
version `2.9.4`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

OpenSearch is a community-driven, open source fork of Elasticsearch
and Kibana following the license change in early 2021. There is an
issue with the implementation of tenant permissions in OpenSearch
Dashboards where authenticated users with read-only access to a tenant
can perform create, edit and delete operations on index metadata of
dashboards and visualizations in that tenant, potentially rendering
them unavailable. This issue does not affect index data, only
metadata. Dashboards correctly enforces read-only permissions when
indexing and updating documents. This issue does not provide
additional read access to data users don&#8217;t already have. This issue
can be mitigated by disabling the tenants functionality for the
cluster. Versions 1.3.14 and 2.11.0 contain a fix for this issue.

Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. A
user with a limited-permission editor account for the Wagtail admin
can make a direct URL request to the admin view that handles bulk
actions on user accounts. While authentication rules prevent the user
from making any changes, the error message discloses the display names
of user accounts, and by modifying URL parameters, the user can
retrieve the display name for any user. The vulnerability is not
exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail
admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 4.1.8 (LTS),
5.0.5 and 5.1.3. The fix is also included in Release Candidate 1 of
the forthcoming Wagtail 5.2 release. Users are advised to upgrade.

The Apollo Router is a configurable, high-performance graph router
written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo
Federation. Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS)
type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and terminate when
a multi-part response is sent. When users send queries to the router
that uses the `@defer` or Subscriptions, the Router will panic. To be
vulnerable, users of Router must have a coprocessor with
`coprocessor.supergraph.response` configured in their `router.yaml`
and also to support either `@defer` or Subscriptions. Apollo Router
version 1.33.0 has a fix for this vulnerability which was introduced
in PR #4014. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
should avoid using the coprocessor supergraph response or disable
defer and subscriptions support and continue to use the coprocessor
supergraph response.

Bunkum is an open-source protocol-agnostic request server for custom
game servers. First, a little bit of background. So, in the beginning,
Bunkum's `AuthenticationService` only supported injecting `IUser`s.
However, as Refresh and SoundShapesServer implemented permissions
systems support for injecting `IToken`s into endpoints was added. All
was well until 4.0. Bunkum 4.0 then changed to enforce relations
between `IToken`s and `IUser`s. This wasn't implemented in a very good
way in the `AuthenticationService`, and ended up breaking caching in
such a way that cached tokens would persist after the lifetime of the
request - since we tried to cache both tokens and users. From that
point until now, from what I understand, Bunkum was attempting to use
that cached token at the start of the next request once cached.
Naturally, when that token expired, downstream projects like Refresh
would remove the object from Realm - and cause the object in the cache
to be in a detached state, causing an exception from invalid use of
`IToken.User`. So in other words, a use-after-free since Realm can't
manage the lifetime of the cached token. Security-wise, the scope is
fairly limited, can only be pulled off on a couple endpoints given a
few conditions, and you can't guarantee which token you're going to
get. Also, the token *would* get invalidated properly if the endpoint
had either a `IToken` usage or a `IUser` usage. The fix is to just
wipe the token cache after the request was handled, which is now in
`4.2.1`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
for this vulnerability.

users who are using the `wget` extractor and view the content it
outputs. The impact is potentially severe if you are logged in to the
ArchiveBox admin site in the same browser session and view an archived
malicious page designed to target your ArchiveBox instance. Malicious
Javascript could potentially act using your logged-in admin
credentials and add/remove/modify snapshots, add/remove/modify
ArchiveBox users, and generally do anything an admin user could do.
The impact is less severe for non-logged-in users, as malicious
Javascript cannot *modify* any archives, but it can still *read* all
the other archived content by fetching the snapshot index and
iterating through it. Because all of ArchiveBox's archived content is
served from the same host and port as the admin panel, when archived
pages are viewed the JS executes in the same context as all the other
archived pages (and the admin panel), defeating most of the browser's
usual CORS/CSRF security protections and leading to this issue. A
patch is being developed in
https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/issues/239. As a mitigation
for this issue would be to disable the wget extractor by setting
`archivebox config --set SAVE_WGET=False`, ensure you are always
logged out, or serve only a [static HTML
version](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/wiki/Publishing-
Your-Archive#2-export-and-host-it-as-static-html) of your archive.

Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. Prior
to version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version 3.2.0.beta3 of the
`beta` and `tests-passed` branches, there is an edge case where a
bookmark reminder is sent and an unread notification is generated, but
the underlying bookmarkable (e.g. post, topic, chat message) security
has changed, making it so the user can no longer access the underlying
resource. As of version 3.1.3 of the `stable` branch and version
3.2.0.beta3 of the `beta` and `tests-passed` branches, bookmark
reminders are now no longer sent if the user does not have access to
the underlying bookmarkable, and also the unread bookmark
notifications are always filtered by access. There are no known
workarounds.

TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site
scripting (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE&#8217;s core undo
and redo functionality. When a carefully-crafted HTML snippet passes
the XSS sanitisation layer, it is manipulated as a string by internal
trimming functions before being stored in the undo stack. If the HTML
snippet is restored from the undo stack, the combination of the string
manipulation and reparative parsing by either the browser's native
[DOMParser API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/API/DOMParser) (TinyMCE 6) or the SaxParser API (TinyMCE
5) mutates the HTML maliciously, allowing an XSS payload to be
executed. This vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.8 and
TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring HTML is trimmed using node-level
manipulation instead of string manipulation. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE&#8217;s Notification Manager
API. The vulnerability exploits TinyMCE's unfiltered notification
system, which is used in error handling. The conditions for this
exploit requires carefully crafted malicious content to have been
inserted into the editor and a notification to have been triggered.
When a notification was opened, the HTML within the text argument was
displayed unfiltered in the notification. The vulnerability allowed
arbitrary JavaScript execution when an notification presented in the
TinyMCE UI for the current user. This issue could also be exploited by
any integration which uses a TinyMCE notification to display
unfiltered HTML content. This vulnerability has been patched in
TinyMCE 5.10.8 and TinyMCE 6.7.1 by ensuring that the HTML displayed
in the notification is sanitized, preventing the exploit. Users are
advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding,
installing, and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF
projects. During a security audit of Artifact Hub's code base a
security researcher identified a bug in which the
`registryIsDockerHub` function was only checking that the registry
domain had the `docker.io` suffix. Artifact Hub allows providing some
Docker credentials that are used to increase the rate limit applied
when interacting with the Docker Hub registry API to read publicly
available content. Due to the incorrect check described above, it'd be
possible to hijack those credentials by purchasing a domain which ends
with `docker.io` and deploying a fake OCI registry on it.
<https://artifacthub.io/> uses some credentials that only have
permissions to read public content available in the Docker Hub.
However, even though credentials for private repositories (disabled on
`artifacthub.io`) are handled in a different way, other Artifact Hub
deployments could have been using them for a different purpose. This
issue has been resolved in version `1.16.0`. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding,
installing, and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF
projects. During a security audit of Artifact Hub's code base a
security researcher identified a bug in which a default unsafe rego
built-in was allowed to be used when defining authorization policies.
Artifact Hub includes a fine-grained authorization mechanism that
allows organizations to define what actions can be performed by their
members. It is based on customizable authorization policies that are
enforced by the `Open Policy Agent`. Policies are written using `rego`
and their data files are expected to be json documents. By default,
`rego` allows policies to make HTTP requests, which can be abused to
send requests to internal resources and forward the responses to an
external entity. In the context of Artifact Hub, this capability
should have been disabled. This issue has been resolved in version
`1.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
for this vulnerability.

Artifact Hub is a web-based application that enables finding,
installing, and publishing packages and configurations for CNCF
projects. During a security audit of Artifact Hub's code base a
security researcher identified a bug in which by using symbolic links
in certain kinds of repositories loaded into Artifact Hub, it was
possible to read internal files. Artifact Hub indexes content from a
variety of sources, including git repositories. When processing git
based repositories, Artifact Hub clones the repository and, depending
on the artifact kind, reads some files from it. During this process,
in some cases, no validation was done to check if the file was a
symbolic link. This made possible to read arbitrary files in the
system, potentially leaking sensitive information. This issue has been
resolved in version `1.16.0`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

ydb-go-sdk is a pure Go native and database/sql driver for the YDB
platform. Since ydb-go-sdk v3.48.6 if you use a custom credentials
object (implementation of interface Credentials it may leak into logs.
This happens because this object could be serialized into an error
message using `fmt.Errorf("something went wrong (credentials: %q)",
credentials)` during connection to the YDB server. If such logging
occurred, a malicious user with access to logs could read sensitive
information (i.e. credentials) information and use it to get access to
the database. ydb-go-sdk contains this problem in versions from
v3.48.6 to v3.53.2. The fix for this problem has been released in
version v3.53.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
should implement the `fmt.Stringer` interface in your custom
credentials type with explicit stringify of object state.

ILIAS (2013-09-12 release) contains a medium-criticality Directory
Traversal local file inclusion vulnerability in the ScormAicc module.
An attacker with a privileged account, typically holding the tutor
role, can exploit this to gain unauthorized access to and potentially
retrieve confidential files stored on the web server. The attacker can
access files that are readable by the web server user www-data; this
may include sensitive configuration files and documents located
outside the documentRoot. The vulnerability is exploited by an
attacker who manipulates the file parameter in a URL, inserting
directory traversal sequences in order to access unauthorized files.
This manipulation allows the attacker to retrieve sensitive files,
such as /etc/passwd, potentially compromising the system's security.
This issue poses a significant risk to confidentiality and is remotely
exploitable over the internet.

The Learning Module in ILIAS 7.25 (2023-09-12 release) allows an
attacker (with basic user privileges) to achieve a high-impact
Directory Traversal attack on confidentiality and availability. By
exploiting this network-based vulnerability, the attacker can move
specified directories, normally outside the documentRoot, to a
publicly accessible location via the PHP function rename(). This
results in a total loss of confidentiality, exposing sensitive
resources, and potentially denying access to the affected component
and the operating system's components. To exploit this, an attacker
must manipulate a POST request during the creation of an exercise
unit, by modifying the old_name and new_name parameters via directory
traversal. However, it's essential to note that, when exploiting this
vulnerability, the specified directory will be relocated from its
original location, rendering all files obtained from there
unavailable.

ILIAS 7.25 (2023-09-12) allows any authenticated user to execute
arbitrary operating system commands remotely, when a highly privileged
account accesses an XSS payload. The injected commands are executed
via the exec() function in the execQuoted() method of the ilUtil class
(/Services/Utilities/classes/class.ilUtil.php) This allows attackers
to inject malicious commands into the system, potentially compromising
the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the ILIAS
installation and the underlying operating system.

GibbonEdu Gibbon version 25.0.1 and before allows Arbitrary File Write
because rubrics_visualise_saveAjax.phps does not require
authentication. The endpoint accepts the img, path, and gibbonPersonID
parameters. The img parameter is expected to be a base64 encoded
image. If the path parameter is set, the defined path is used as the
destination folder, concatenated with the absolute path of the

Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop
platforms. This advisory is not describing a vulnerability in the
Tauri code base itself but a commonly used misconfiguration which
could lead to leaking of the private key and updater key password into
bundled Tauri applications using the Vite frontend in a specific
configuration. The Tauri documentation used an insecure example
configuration in the `Vite guide` to showcase how to use Tauri
together with Vite. Copying the following snippet `envPrefix:
['VITE_', 'TAURI_'],` from this guide into the `vite.config.ts` of a
Tauri project leads to bundling the `TAURI_PRIVATE_KEY` and
`TAURI_KEY_PASSWORD` into the Vite frontend code and therefore leaking
this value to the released Tauri application. Using the `envPrefix:
['VITE_'],` or any other framework than Vite means you are not
impacted by this advisory. Users are advised to rotate their updater
private key if they are affected by this (requires Tauri CLI >=1.5.5).
After updating the envPrefix configuration, generate a new private key
with `tauri signer generate`, saving the new private key and updating
the updater's `pubkey` value on `tauri.conf.json` with the new public
key. To update your existing application, the next application build
must be signed with the older private key in order to be accepted by
the existing application.

Tutanota (Tuta Mail) is an encrypted email provider. Tutanota allows
users to open links in emails in external applications. Prior to
version 3.118.12, it correctly blocks the `file:` URL scheme, which
can be used by malicious actors to gain code execution on a victims
computer, however fails to check other harmful schemes such as `ftp:`,
`smb:`, etc. which can also be used. Successful exploitation of this
vulnerability will enable an attacker to gain code execution on a
victim's computer. Version 3.118.2 contains a patch for this issue.

yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. The
Generic Extractor in yt-dlp is vulnerable to an attacker setting an
arbitrary proxy for a request to an arbitrary url, allowing the
attacker to MITM the request made from yt-dlp's HTTP session. This
could lead to cookie exfiltration in some cases. Version 2023.11.14
removed the ability to smuggle `http_headers` to the Generic
extractor, as well as other extractors that use the same pattern.
Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable
the Ggneric extractor (or only pass trusted sites with trusted
content) and ake caution when using `--no-check-certificate`.

enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API
allows users to retrieve its configuration using the `GET
api/v1/config` endpoint. The configuration data is filtered to
suppress most sensitive configuration information before it is
returned to the user, but even the filtered data contains information
about the internals and the backend infrastructure, such as various
settings, servers&#8217; addresses and ports and database username. This
information is useful for administrative users as well as attackers,
thus it should not be revealed to low-privileged users. This

NATS.io is a high performance open source pub-sub distributed
communication technology, built for the cloud, on-premise, IoT, and
edge computing. The cryptographic key handling library, nkeys,
recently gained support for encryption, not just for
signing/authentication. This is used in nats-server 2.10 (Sep 2023)
and newer for authentication callouts. In nkeys versions 0.4.0 through
0.4.5, corresponding with NATS server versions 2.10.0 through 2.10.3,
the nkeys library's `xkeys` encryption handling logic mistakenly
passed an array by value into an internal function, where the function
mutated that buffer to populate the encryption key to use. As a
result, all encryption was actually to an all-zeros key. This affects
encryption only, not signing. FIXME: FILL IN IMPACT ON NATS-SERVER

Server 2.10.4, has a patch for this issue. No known workarounds are

Hyperledger Fabric is an open source permissioned distributed ledger
framework. Combining two molecules to one another, called "cross-
linking" results in a molecule with a chemical formula that is
composed of all atoms of the original two molecules. In Fabric, one
can take a block of transactions and cross-link the transactions in a
way that alters the way the peers parse the transactions. If a first
peer receives a block B and a second peer receives a block identical
to B but with the transactions being cross-linked, the second peer
will parse transactions in a different way and thus its world state
will deviate from the first peer. Orderers or peers cannot detect that
a block has its transactions cross-linked, because there is a
vulnerability in the way Fabric hashes the transactions of blocks. It
simply and naively concatenates them, which is insecure and lets an
adversary craft a "cross-linked block" (block with cross-linked
transactions) which alters the way peers process transactions. For
example, it is possible to select a transaction and manipulate a peer
to completely avoid processing it, without changing the computed hash
of the block. Additional validations have been added in v2.2.14 and
v2.5.5 to detect potential cross-linking issues before processing
blocks. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
for this vulnerability.

TypeScript. Prior to version 2.1.0, CryptoES PBKDF2 is 1,000 times
weaker than originally specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times
weaker than current industry standard. This is because it both
defaults to SHA1, a cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure
since at least 2005, and defaults to one single iteration, a
'strength' or 'difficulty' value specified at 1,000 when specified in
1993. PBKDF2 relies on iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage
and collision attacks. If used to protect passwords, the impact is
high. If used to generate signatures, the impact is high. Version
2.1.0 contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, configure
CryptoES to use SHA256 with at least 250,000 iterations.

D-Tale is the combination of a Flask back-end and a React front-end to
view & analyze Pandas data structures. Prior to version 3.7.0, users
hosting D-Tale publicly can be vulnerable to remote code execution,
allowing attackers to run malicious code on the server. This issue has
been patched in version 3.7.0 by turning off "Custom Filter" input by
default. The only workaround for versions earlier than 3.7.0 is to
only host D-Tale to trusted users.

Werkzeug is a comprehensive WSGI web application library. If an upload
of a file that starts with CR or LF and then is followed by megabytes
of data without these characters: all of these bytes are appended
chunk by chunk into internal bytearray and lookup for boundary is
performed on growing buffer. This allows an attacker to cause a denial
of service by sending crafted multipart data to an endpoint that will
parse it. The amount of CPU time required can block worker processes
from handling legitimate requests. This vulnerability has been patched
in version 3.0.1.

Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Prior
to version 23.10.0rc1, when sending multiple HTTP requests in one TCP
packet, twisted.web will process the requests asynchronously without
guaranteeing the response order. If one of the endpoints is controlled
by an attacker, the attacker can delay the response on purpose to
manipulate the response of the second request when a victim launched
two requests using HTTP pipeline. Version 23.10.0rc1 contains a patch
for this issue.

JumpServer is an open source bastion host and maintenance security
audit system that complies with 4A specifications. Prior to version
3.8.0, the default email for initial user admin is
`admin[@]mycompany[.]com`, and users reset their passwords by sending
an email. Currently, the domain `mycompany.com` has not been
registered. However, if it is registered in the future, it may affect
the password reset functionality. This issue has been patched in
version 3.8.0 by changing the default email domain to `example.com`.
Those who cannot upgrade may change the default email domain to
`example.com` manually.

KernelSU is a Kernel based root solution for Android. Starting in
version 0.6.1 and prior to version 0.7.0, if a KernelSU installed
device is infected with a malware whose app signing block specially
constructed, it can take over root privileges on the device. The
vulnerable verification logic actually obtains the signature of the
last block with an id of `0x7109871a`, while the verification logic
during Android installation is to obtain the first one. In addition to
the actual signature upgrade that has been fixed (KSU thought it was
V2 but was actually V3), there is also the problem of actual signature
downgrading (KSU thought it was V2 but was actually V1). Find a
condition in the signature verification logic that will cause the
signature not to be found error, and KernelSU does not implement the
same conditions, so KSU thinks there is a V2 signature, but the APK
signature verification actually uses the V1 signature. This issue is
fixed in version 0.7.0. As workarounds, keep the KernelSU manager
installed and avoid installing unknown apps.

This flaw allows a malicious HTTP server to set "super cookies" in
curl that are then passed back to more origins than what is otherwise
allowed or possible. This allows a site to set cookies that then would
get sent to different and unrelated sites and domains. It could do
this by exploiting a mixed case flaw in curl's function that verifies
a given cookie domain against the Public Suffix List (PSL). For
example a cookie could be set with `domain=co.UK` when the URL used a
lower case hostname `curl.co.uk`, even though `co.uk` is listed as a
PSL domain.

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's af_unix component
can be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The
unix_stream_sendpage() function tries to add data to the last skb in
the peer's recv queue without locking the queue. Thus there is a race
where unix_stream_sendpage() could access an skb locklessly that is
being released by garbage collection, resulting in use-after-free. We
recommend upgrading past commit
790c2f9d15b594350ae9bca7b236f2b1859de02c.

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched:
sch_hfsc (HFSC qdisc traffic control) component can be exploited to
achieve local privilege escalation. If a class with a link-sharing
curve (i.e. with the HFSC_FSC flag set) has a parent without a link-
sharing curve, then init_vf() will call vttree_insert() on the parent,
but vttree_remove() will be skipped in update_vf(). This leaves a
dangling pointer that can cause a use-after-free. We recommend
upgrading past commit b3d26c5702c7d6c45456326e56d2ccf3f103e60f.

era-compiler-vyper is the EraVM Vyper compiler for zkSync Era, a layer
2 rollup that uses zero-knowledge proofs to scale Ethereum. Prior to
era-compiler-vype version 1.3.10, a bug prevented the initialization
of the first immutable variable for Vyper contracts meeting certain
criteria. The problem arises when there is a String or Array with more
256-bit words allocated than initialized. It results in the second
word&#8217;s index unset, that is effectively set to 0, so the first
immutable value with the actual 0 index is overwritten in the
ImmutableSimulator. Version 1.3.10 fixes this issue by setting all
indexes in advance. The problem will go away, but it will get more
expensive if the user allocates a lot of uninitialized space, e.g.
`String[4096]`. Upgrading and redeploying affected contracts is the
only way of working around the issue.

crypto-js is a JavaScript library of crypto standards. Prior to
version 4.2.0, crypto-js PBKDF2 is 1,000 times weaker than originally
specified in 1993, and at least 1,300,000 times weaker than current
industry standard. This is because it both defaults to SHA1, a
cryptographic hash algorithm considered insecure since at least 2005,
and defaults to one single iteration, a 'strength' or 'difficulty'
value specified at 1,000 when specified in 1993. PBKDF2 relies on
iteration count as a countermeasure to preimage and collision attacks.
If used to protect passwords, the impact is high. If used to generate
signatures, the impact is high. Version 4.2.0 contains a patch for
this issue. As a workaround, configure crypto-js to use SHA256 with at
least 250,000 iterations.

browserify-sign is a package to duplicate the functionality of node's
crypto public key functions, much of this is based on Fedor Indutny's
work on indutny/tls.js. An upper bound check issue in `dsaVerify`
function allows an attacker to construct signatures that can be
successfully verified by any public key, thus leading to a signature
forgery attack. All places in this project that involve DSA
verification of user-input signatures will be affected by this
vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 4.2.2.

ZITADEL is an identity infrastructure management system. ZITADEL users
can upload their own avatar image using various image types including
SVG. SVG can include scripts, such as javascript, which can be
executed during rendering. Due to a missing security header, an
attacker could inject code to an SVG to gain access to the victim&#8217;s
account in certain scenarios. A victim would need to directly open the
malicious image in the browser, where a single session in ZITADEL
needs to be active for this exploit to work. If the possible victim
had multiple or no active sessions in ZITADEL, the attack would not
succeed. This issue has been patched in version 2.39.2 and 2.38.2.

quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol in Go. Starting in
version 0.37.0 and prior to version 0.37.3, by serializing an ACK
frame after the CRYTPO that allows a node to complete the handshake, a
remote node could trigger a nil pointer dereference (leading to a
panic) when the node attempted to drop the Handshake packet number
space. An attacker can bring down a quic-go node with very minimal
effort. Completing the QUIC handshake only requires sending and
receiving a few packets. Version 0.37.3 contains a patch. Versions
before 0.37.0 are not affected.

CodeIgniter is a PHP full-stack web framework. Prior to CodeIgniter4
version 4.4.3, if an error or exception occurs, a detailed error
report is displayed even if in the production environment. As a
result, confidential information may be leaked. Version 4.4.3 contains
a patch. As a workaround, replace `ini_set('display_errors', '0')`
with `ini_set('display_errors', 'Off')` in
`app/Config/Boot/production.php`.

`discourse-microsoft-auth` is a plugin that enables authentication via
Microsoft. On sites with the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin
enabled, an attack can potentially take control of a victim's
Discourse account. Sites that have configured their application's
account type to any options other than `Accounts in this
organizational directory only (O365 only - Single tenant)` are
vulnerable. This vulnerability has been patched in commit
c40665f44509724b64938c85def9fb2e79f62ec8 of `discourse-microsoft-
auth`. A `microsoft_auth:revoke` rake task has also been added which
will deactivate and log out all users that have connected their
accounts to Microsoft. User API keys as well as API keys created by
those users will also be revoked. The rake task will also remove the
connection records to Microsoft for those users. This will allow
affected users to re-verify their account emails as well as reconnect
their Discourse account to Microsoft for authentication. As a
workaround, disable the `discourse-microsoft-auth` plugin by setting
the `microsoft_auth_enabled` site setting to `false`. Run the
`microsoft_auth:log_out_users` rake task to log out all users with
associated Microsoft accounts.

Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM). Contracts containing large arrays might underallocate
the number of slots they need by 1. Prior to v0.3.8, the calculation
to determine how many slots a storage variable needed used
`math.ceil(type_.size_in_bytes / 32)`. The intermediate floating point
step can produce a rounding error if there are enough bits set in the
IEEE-754 mantissa. Roughly speaking, if `type_.size_in_bytes` is large
(> 2**46), and slightly less than a power of 2, the calculation can
overestimate how many slots are needed by 1. If `type_.size_in_bytes`
is slightly more than a power of 2, the calculation can underestimate
how many slots are needed by 1. This issue is patched in version
0.3.8.

Cody is an artificial intelligence (AI) coding assistant. The Cody AI
VSCode extension versions 0.10.0 through 0.14.0 are vulnerable to
Remote Code Execution under certain conditions. An attacker in control
of a malicious repository could modify the Cody configuration file
`.vscode/cody.json` and overwrite Cody commands. If a user with the
extension installed opens this malicious repository and runs a Cody
command such as /explain or /doc, this could allow arbitrary code
execution on the user's machine. The vulnerability is rated as
critical severity, but with low exploitability. It requires the user
to have a malicious repository loaded and execute the overwritten
command in VS Code. The issue is exploitable regardless of the user
blocking code execution on a repository through VS Code Workspace
Trust. The issue was found during a regular 3rd party penetration
test. The maintainers of Cody do not have evidence of open source
repositories having malicious `.vscode/cody.json` files to exploit
this vulnerability. The issue is fixed in version 0.14.1 of the Cody
VSCode extension. In case users can't promptly upgrade, they should
not open any untrusted repositories with the Cody extension loaded.

authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions
2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2, when the default admin user has been deleted,
it is potentially possible for an attacker to set the password of the
default admin user without any authentication. authentik uses a
blueprint to create the default admin user, which can also optionally
set the default admin users' password from an environment variable.
When the user is deleted, the `initial-setup` flow used to configure
authentik after the first installation becomes available again.
authentik 2023.8.4 and 2023.10.2 fix this issue. As a workaround,
ensure the default admin user (Username `akadmin`) exists and has a
password set. It is recommended to use a very strong password for this
user, and store it in a secure location like a password manager. It is
also possible to deactivate the user to prevent any logins as akadmin.

pypdf is a free and open-source pure-python PDF library. An attacker
who uses a vulnerability present in versions 3.7.0 through 3.16.4 can
craft a PDF which leads to an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks
the current process and can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%.
It does not affect memory usage. That is, for example, the case when
the pypdf-user manipulates an incoming malicious PDF e.g. by merging
it with another PDF or by adding annotations. The issue was fixed in
version 3.17.0. As a workaround, apply the patch manually by modifying
`pypdf/generic/_data_structures.py`.

MyBB is a free and open source forum software. Custom MyCode (BBCode)
for the visual editor (_SCEditor_) doesn't escape input properly when
rendering HTML, resulting in a DOM-based XSS vulnerability. This
weakness can be exploited by pointing a victim to a page where the
visual editor is active (e.g. as a post or Private Message) and
operates on a maliciously crafted MyCode message. This may occur on
pages where message content is pre-filled using a GET/POST parameter,
or on reply pages where a previously saved malicious message is
quoted. The impact is be mitigated when: 1. the visual editor is
disabled globally (_Admin CP &#8594; Configuration &#8594; Settings &#8594; Clickable

Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub.
Affected versions are missing origin verification in a postMessage
handler which introduces a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
The editor-sdk.js file defines three different class-like functions,
which employ a global message event listener: SquidexSidebar,
SquidexWidget, and SquidexFormField. The registered event listener
takes some action based on the type of the received message. For
example, when the SquidexFormField receives a message with the type
valueChanged, the value property is updated. The SquidexFormField
class is for example used in the editor-editorjs.html file, which can
be accessed via the public wwwroot folder. It uses the onValueChanged
method to register a callback function, which passes the value
provided from the message event to the editor.render. Passing an
attacker-controlled value to this function introduces a Cross-Site
Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub.
Affected versions are subject to an arbitrary file write vulnerability
in the backup restore feature which allows an authenticated attacker
to gain remote code execution (RCE). Squidex allows users with the
`squidex.admin.restore` permission to create and restore backups. Part
of these backups are the assets uploaded to an App. For each asset,
the backup zip archive contains a `.asset` file with the actual
content of the asset as well as a related `AssetCreatedEventV2` event,
which is stored in a JSON file. Amongst other things, the JSON file
contains the event type (`AssetCreatedEventV2`), the ID of the asset
(`46c05041-9588-4179-b5eb-ddfcd9463e1e`), its filename (`test.txt`),
and its file version (`0`). When a backup with this event is restored,
the `BackupAssets.ReadAssetAsync` method is responsible for re-
creating the asset. For this purpose, it determines the name of the
`.asset` file in the zip archive, reads its content, and stores the
content in the filestore. When the asset is stored in the filestore
via the UploadAsync method, the assetId and fileVersion are passed as
arguments. These are further passed to the method GetFileName, which
determines the filename where the asset should be stored. The assetId
is inserted into the filename without any sanitization and an attacker
with squidex.admin.restore privileges to run arbitrary operating
system commands on the underlying server (RCE).

capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for Capsule kubernetes multi-tenancy
framework. A bug in the RoleBinding reflector used by `capsule-proxy`
gives ServiceAccount tenant owners the right to list Namespaces of
other tenants backed by the same owner kind and name. For example
consider two tenants `solar` and `wind`. Tenant `solar`, owned by a
ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the Namespace `solar`. Tenant
`wind`, owned by a ServiceAccount named `tenant-owner` in the
Namespace `wind`. The Tenant owner `solar` would be able to list the
namespaces of the Tenant `wind` and vice-versa, although this is not
correct. The bug introduces an exfiltration vulnerability since allows
the listing of Namespace resources of other Tenants, although just in
some specific conditions: 1. `capsule-proxy` runs with the `--disable-
caching=false` (default value: `false`) and 2. Tenant owners are
ServiceAccount, with the same resource name, but in different
Namespaces. This vulnerability doesn't allow any privilege escalation
on the outer tenant Namespace-scoped resources, since the Kubernetes
RBAC is enforcing this. This issue has been addressed in version
0.4.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
for this vulnerability.

PX4-Autopilot provides PX4 flight control solution for drones. In
versions 1.14.0-rc1 and prior, PX4-Autopilot has a heap buffer
overflow vulnerability in the parser function due to the absence of
`parserbuf_index` value checking. A malfunction of the sensor device
can cause a heap buffer overflow with leading unexpected drone
behavior. Malicious applications can exploit the vulnerability even if
device sensor malfunction does not occur. Up to the maximum value of
an `unsigned int`, bytes sized data can be written to the heap memory
area. As of time of publication, no fixed version is available.

Apache Software Foundation Apache Submarine has a bug when serializing
against yaml. The bug is caused by snakeyaml
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1471 . Apache Submarine uses
JAXRS to define REST endpoints. In order to handle YAML requests
(using application/yaml content-type), it defines a YamlEntityProvider
entity provider that will process all incoming YAML requests. In order
to unmarshal the request, the readFrom method is invoked, passing the
entityStream containing the user-supplied data in `submarine-
server/server-
core/src/main/java/org/apache/submarine/server/utils/YamlUtils.java`.
We have now fixed this issue in the new version by replacing to
`jackson-dataformat-yaml`. This issue affects Apache Submarine: from
0.7.0 before 0.8.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 0.8.0,
which fixes this issue. If using the version smaller than 0.8.0 and
not want to upgrade, you can try cherry-pick PR
https://github.com/apache/submarine/pull/1054 and rebuild the submart-
server image to fix this.

The Media Library Assistant plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
Local File Inclusion and Remote Code Execution in versions up to, and
including, 3.09. This is due to insufficient controls on file paths
being supplied to the 'mla_stream_file' parameter from the
~/includes/mla-stream-image.php file, where images are processed via
Imagick(). This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
supply files via FTP that will make directory lists, local file
inclusion, and remote code execution possible.

An issue was discovered by Elastic whereby sensitive information may
be recorded in Kibana logs in the event of an error or in the event
where debug level logging is enabled in Kibana. Elastic has released
Kibana 8.11.2 which resolves this issue. The messages recorded in the
log may contain Account credentials for the kibana_system user, API
Keys, and credentials of Kibana end-users, Elastic Security package
policy objects which can contain private keys, bearer token, and
sessions of 3rd-party integrations and finally Authorization headers,
client secrets, local file paths, and stack traces. The issue may
occur in any Kibana instance running an affected version that could
potentially receive an unexpected error when communicating to
Elasticsearch causing it to include sensitive data into Kibana error
logs. It could also occur under specific circumstances when debug
level logging is enabled in Kibana. Note: It was found that the fix
for ESA-2023-25 in Kibana 8.11.1 for a similar issue was incomplete.

Squid is a caching proxy for the Web. Due to an Improper Validation of
Specified Index bug, Squid versions 3.3.0.1 through 5.9 and 6.0 prior
to 6.4 compiled using `--with-openssl` are vulnerable to a Denial of
Service attack against SSL Certificate validation. This problem allows
a remote server to perform Denial of Service against Squid Proxy by
initiating a TLS Handshake with a specially crafted SSL Certificate in
a server certificate chain. This attack is limited to HTTPS and SSL-
Bump. This bug is fixed in Squid version 6.4. In addition, patches
addressing this problem for the stable releases can be found in
Squid's patch archives. Those who you use a prepackaged version of
Squid should refer to the package vendor for availability information
on updated packages.

FoodCoopShop is open source software for food coops and local shops.
Versions starting with 3.2.0 prior to 3.6.1 are vulnerable to server-
side request forgery. In the Network module, a manufacturer account
can use the `/api/updateProducts.json` endpoint to make the server
send a request to an arbitrary host. This means that the server can be
used as a proxy into the internal network where the server is.
Furthermore, the checks on a valid image are not adequate, leading to
a time of check time of use issue. For example, by using a custom
server that returns 200 on HEAD requests, then return a valid image on
first GET request and then a 302 redirect to final target on second
GET request, the server will copy whatever file is at the redirect
destination, making this a full SSRF. Version 3.6.1 fixes this
vulnerability.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. XWiki doesn't properly escape the
section URL parameter that is used in the code for displaying
administration sections. This allows any user with read access to the
document `XWiki.AdminSheet` (by default, everyone including
unauthenticated users) to execute code including Groovy code. This
impacts the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole
XWiki instance. This vulnerability has been patched in XWiki 14.10.14,
15.6 RC1 and 15.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unablr to
upgrade may apply the fix in commit `fec8e0e53f9` manually.
Alternatively, to protect against attacks from unauthenticated users,
view right for guests can be removed from this document (it is only
needed for space and wiki admins).

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. XWiki is vulnerable to reflected
cross-site scripting (RXSS) via the `rev` parameter that is used in
the content of the content menu without escaping. If an attacker can
convince a user to visit a link with a crafted parameter, this allows
the attacker to execute arbitrary actions in the name of the user,
including remote code (Groovy) execution in the case of a user with
programming right, compromising the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched in
XWiki 15.6 RC1, 15.5.1 and 14.10.14. The patch in commit `04e325d57`
can be manually applied without upgrading (or restarting) the
instance. Users are advised to upgrade or to manually apply the patch.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
of reusable PHP components. Starting in versions 5.4.21 and 6.2.7 and
prior to versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8, `SessionStrategyListener` does not
migrate the session after every successful login. It does so only in
case the logged in user changes by means of checking the user
identifier. In some use cases, the user identifier doesn't change
between the verification phase and the successful login, while the
token itself changes from one type (partially-authenticated) to
another (fully-authenticated). When this happens, the session id
should be regenerated to prevent possible session fixations, which is
not the case at the moment. As of versions 5.4.31 and 6.3.8, Symfony
now checks the type of the token in addition to the user identifier
before deciding whether the session id should be regenerated.

Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
of reusable PHP components. Starting in versions 2.0.0, 5.0.0, and
6.0.0 and prior to versions 4.4.51, 5.4.31, and 6.3.8, some Twig
filters in CodeExtension use `is_safe=html` but don't actually ensure
their input is safe. As of versions 4.4.51, 5.4.31, and 6.3.8, Symfony
now escapes the output of the affected filters.

EspoCRM is an Open Source CRM (Customer Relationship Management)
software. In affected versions there is Server-Side Request Forgery
(SSRF) vulnerability via the upload image from url api. Users who have
access to `the /Attachment/fromImageUrl` endpoint can specify URL to
point to an internal host. Even though there is check for content
type, it can be bypassed by redirects in some cases. This SSRF can be
leveraged to disclose internal information (in some cases), target
internal hosts and bypass firewalls. This vulnerability has been
addressed in commit `c536cee63` which is included in release version
8.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
for this vulnerability.

Cosign is a sigstore signing tool for OCI containers. Cosign is
susceptible to a denial of service by an attacker controlled registry.
An attacker who controls a remote registry can return a high number of
attestations and/or signatures to Cosign and cause Cosign to enter a
long loop resulting in an endless data attack. The root cause is that
Cosign loops through all attestations fetched from the remote registry
in pkg/cosign.FetchAttestations. The attacker needs to compromise the
registry or make a request to a registry they control. When doing so,
the attacker must return a high number of attestations in the response
to Cosign. The result will be that the attacker can cause Cosign to go
into a long or infinite loop that will prevent other users from
verifying their data. In Kyvernos case, an attacker whose privileges
are limited to making requests to the cluster can make a request with
an image reference to their own registry, trigger the infinite loop
and deny other users from completing their admission requests.
Alternatively, the attacker can obtain control of the registry used by
an organization and return a high number of attestations instead the
expected number of attestations. The issue can be mitigated rather
simply by setting a limit to the limit of attestations that Cosign
will loop through. The limit does not need to be high to be within the
vast majority of use cases and still prevent the endless data attack.
This issue has been patched in version 2.2.1 and users are advised to
upgrade.

CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A security
vulnerability was found in CubeFS HandlerNode in versions prior to
3.3.1 that could allow authenticated users to send maliciously-crafted
requests that would crash the ObjectNode and deny other users from
using it. The root cause was improper handling of incoming HTTP
requests that could allow an attacker to control the ammount of memory
that the ObjectNode would allocate. A malicious request could make the
ObjectNode allocate more memory that the machine had available, and
the attacker could exhaust memory by way of a single malicious
request. An attacker would need to be authenticated in order to invoke
the vulnerable code with their malicious request and have permissions
to delete objects. In addition, the attacker would need to know the
names of existing buckets of the CubeFS deployment - otherwise the
request would be rejected before it reached the vulnerable code. As
such, the most likely attacker is an inside user or an attacker that
has breached the account of an existing user in the cluster. The issue
has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other mitigation besides
upgrading.

CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A
vulnerability was found during in the CubeFS master component in
versions prior to 3.3.1 that could allow an untrusted attacker to
steal user passwords by carrying out a timing attack. The root case of
the vulnerability was that CubeFS used raw string comparison of
passwords. The vulnerable part of CubeFS was the UserService of the
master component. The UserService gets instantiated when starting the
server of the master component. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1.
For impacted users, there is no other way to mitigate the issue
besides upgrading.

CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. Prior to
version 3.3.1, CubeFS used an insecure random string generator to
generate user-specific, sensitive keys used to authenticate users in a
CubeFS deployment. This could allow an attacker to predict and/or
guess the generated string and impersonate a user thereby obtaining
higher privileges. When CubeFS creates new users, it creates a piece
of sensitive information for the user called the &#8220;accessKey&#8221;. To
create the "accesKey", CubeFS uses an insecure string generator which
makes it easy to guess and thereby impersonate the created user. An
attacker could leverage the predictable random string generator and
guess a users access key and impersonate the user to obtain higher
privileges. The issue has been fixed in v3.3.1. There is no other
mitigation than to upgrade.

CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. A
vulnerability was found in CubeFS prior to version 3.3.1 that could
allow users to read sensitive data from the logs which could allow
them escalate privileges. CubeFS leaks configuration keys in plaintext
format in the logs. These keys could allow anyone to carry out
operations on blobs that they otherwise do not have permissions for.
For example, an attacker that has succesfully retrieved a secret key
from the logs can delete blogs from the blob store. The attacker can
either be an internal user with limited privileges to read the log, or
they can be an external user who has escalated privileges sufficiently
to access the logs. The vulnerability has been patched in v3.3.1.
There is no other mitigation than upgrading.

CubeFS is an open-source cloud-native file storage system. CubeFS
prior to version 3.3.1 was found to leak users secret keys and access
keys in the logs in multiple components. When CubeCS creates new
users, it leaks the users secret key. This could allow a lower-
privileged user with access to the logs to retrieve sensitive
information and impersonate other users with higher privileges than
themselves. The issue has been patched in v3.3.1. There is no other
mitigation than upgrading CubeFS.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/Squidex/squidex/security/advisories/GHSA-xfr4-qg2v-7v5m

Squidex is an open source headless CMS and content management hub. In
affected versions a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
enables privilege escalation of authenticated users. The SVG element
filtering mechanism intended to stop XSS attacks through uploaded SVG
images, is insufficient resulting to stored XSS attacks. Squidex
allows the CMS contributors to be granted the permission of uploading
an SVG asset. When the asset is uploaded, a filtering mechanism is
performed to validate that the SVG does not contain malicious code.
The validation logic consists of traversing the HTML nodes in the DOM.
In order for the validation to succeed, 2 conditions must be met: 1.
No HTML tags included in a "blacklist" called "InvalidSvgElements" are
present. This list only contains the element "script". and 2. No
attributes of HTML tags begin with "on" (i.e. onerror, onclick) (line
65). If either of the 2 conditions is not satisfied, validation fails
and the file/asset is not uploaded. However it is possible to bypass
the above filtering mechanism and execute arbitrary JavaScript code by
introducing other HTML elements such as an <iframe> element with a
"src" attribute containing a "javascript:" value. Authenticated
adversaries with the "assets.create" permission, can leverage this
vulnerability to upload a malicious SVG as an asset, targeting any
registered user that will attempt to open/view the asset through the
Squidex CMS.

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before 6.5.9, exploitable
by local users with userspace access to MMIO registers. Incorrect
access checking in the #VC handler and instruction emulation of the
SEV-ES emulation of MMIO accesses could lead to arbitrary write access
to kernel memory (and thus privilege escalation). This depends on a
race condition through which userspace can replace an instruction
before the #VC handler reads it.

The current setup of the quarantine page tables assumes that the
quarantine domain (dom_io) has been initialized with an address width
of DEFAULT_DOMAIN_ADDRESS_WIDTH (48) and hence 4 page table levels.
However dom_io being a PV domain gets the AMD-Vi IOMMU page tables
levels based on the maximum (hot pluggable) RAM address, and hence on
systems with no RAM above the 512GB mark only 3 page-table levels are
configured in the IOMMU. On systems without RAM above the 512GB
boundary amd_iommu_quarantine_init() will setup page tables for the
scratch page with 4 levels, while the IOMMU will be configured to use
3 levels only, resulting in the last page table directory (PDE)
effectively becoming a page table entry (PTE), and hence a device in
quarantine mode gaining write access to the page destined to be a PDE.
Due to this page table level mismatch, the sink page the device gets
read/write access to is no longer cleared between device assignment,
possibly leading to data leaks.

The fixes for XSA-422 (Branch Type Confusion) and XSA-434 (Speculative
Return Stack Overflow) are not IRQ-safe. It was believed that the
mitigations always operated in contexts with IRQs disabled. However,
the original XSA-254 fix for Meltdown (XPTI) deliberately left
interrupts enabled on two entry paths; one unconditionally, and one
conditionally on whether XPTI was active. As BTC/SRSO and Meltdown
affect different CPU vendors, the mitigations are not active together
by default. Therefore, there is a race condition whereby a malicious
PV guest can bypass BTC/SRSO protections and launch a BTC/SRSO attack
against Xen.

Arm provides multiple helpers to clean & invalidate the cache for a
given region. This is, for instance, used when allocating guest memory
to ensure any writes (such as the ones during scrubbing) have reached
memory before handing over the page to a guest. Unfortunately, the
arithmetics in the helpers can overflow and would then result to skip
the cache cleaning/invalidation. Therefore there is no guarantee when
all the writes will reach the memory. This undefined behavior was
meant to be addressed by XSA-437, but the approach was not sufficient.

Transmit requests in Xen's virtual network protocol can consist of
multiple parts. While not really useful, except for the initial part
any of them may be of zero length, i.e. carry no data at all. Besides
a certain initial portion of the to be transferred data, these parts
are directly translated into what Linux calls SKB fragments. Such
converted request parts can, when for a particular SKB they are all of
length zero, lead to a de-reference of NULL in core networking code.

PCI devices can make use of a functionality called phantom functions,
that when enabled allows the device to generate requests using the IDs
of functions that are otherwise unpopulated. This allows a device to
extend the number of outstanding requests. Such phantom functions need
an IOMMU context setup, but failure to setup the context is not fatal
when the device is assigned. Not failing device assignment when such
failure happens can lead to the primary device being assigned to a
guest, while some of the phantom functions are assigned to a different
domain.

Recent x86 CPUs offer functionality named Control-flow Enforcement
Technology (CET). A sub-feature of this are Shadow Stacks (CET-SS).
CET-SS is a hardware feature designed to protect against Return
Oriented Programming attacks. When enabled, traditional stacks holding
both data and return addresses are accompanied by so called "shadow
stacks", holding little more than return addresses. Shadow stacks
aren't writable by normal instructions, and upon function returns
their contents are used to check for possible manipulation of a return
address coming from the traditional stack. In particular certain
memory accesses need intercepting by Xen. In various cases the
necessary emulation involves kind of replaying of the instruction.
Such replaying typically involves filling and then invoking of a stub.
Such a replayed instruction may raise an exceptions, which is expected
and dealt with accordingly. Unfortunately the interaction of both of
the above wasn't right: Recovery involves removal of a call frame from
the (traditional) stack. The counterpart of this operation for the
shadow stack was missing.

Allura Discussion and Allura Forum importing does not restrict URL
values specified in attachments. Project administrators can run these
imports, which could cause Allura to read local files and expose them.
Exposing internal files then can lead to other exploits, like session
hijacking, or remote code execution. This issue affects Apache Allura
from 1.0.1 through 1.15.0. Users are recommended to upgrade to version
1.16.0, which fixes the issue. If you are unable to upgrade, set
"disable_entry_points.allura.importers = forge-tracker, forge-
discussion" in your .ini config file.

Meross MSH30Q 4.5.23 is vulnerable to Cleartext Transmission of
Sensitive Information. During the device setup phase, the MSH30Q
creates an unprotected Wi-Fi access point. In this phase, MSH30Q needs
to connect to the Internet through a Wi-Fi router. This is why MSH30Q
asks for the Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and the Wi-Fi network password.
When the user enters the password, the transmission of the Wi-Fi
password and name between the MSH30Q and mobile application is
observed in the Wi-Fi network. Although the Wi-Fi password is
encrypted, a part of the decryption algorithm is public so we
complemented the missing parts to decrypt it.

A vulnerability was found in Perl. This security issue occurs while
Perl for Windows relies on the system path environment variable to
find the shell (`cmd.exe`). When running an executable that uses the
Windows Perl interpreter, Perl attempts to find and execute `cmd.exe`
within the operating system. However, due to path search order issues,
Perl initially looks for cmd.exe in the current working directory.
This flaw allows an attacker with limited privileges to place`cmd.exe`
in locations with weak permissions, such as `C:\ProgramData`. By doing
so, arbitrary code can be executed when an administrator attempts to
use this executable from these compromised locations.

Traefik is an open source HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. When a
request is sent to Traefik with a URL fragment, Traefik automatically
URL encodes and forwards the fragment to the backend server. This
violates RFC 7230 because in the origin-form the URL should only
contain the absolute path and the query. When this is combined with
another frontend proxy like Nginx, it can be used to bypass frontend
proxy URI-based access control restrictions. This vulnerability has
been addressed in versions 2.10.6 and 3.0.0-beta5. Users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

OpenTelemetry-Go Contrib is a collection of third-party packages for
OpenTelemetry-Go. Prior to version 0.46.0, the grpc Unary Server
Interceptor out of the box adds labels `net.peer.sock.addr` and
`net.peer.sock.port` that have unbound cardinality. It leads to the
server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are
sent. An attacker can easily flood the peer address and port for
requests. Version 0.46.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a
workaround to stop being affected, a view removing the attributes can
be used. The other possibility is to disable grpc metrics
instrumentation by passing `otelgrpc.WithMeterProvider` option with
`noop.NewMeterProvider`.

ZITADEL provides identity infrastructure. ZITADEL provides
administrators the possibility to define a `Lockout Policy` with a
maximum amount of failed password check attempts. On every failed
password check, the amount of failed checks is compared against the
configured maximum. Exceeding the limit, will lock the user and
prevent further authentication. In the affected implementation it was
possible for an attacker to start multiple parallel password checks,
giving him the possibility to try out more combinations than
configured in the `Lockout Policy`. This vulnerability has been

Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the
fulfillment of data privacy requests in your runtime environment, and
the enforcement of privacy regulations in your code. The Fides web
application allows data subject users to request access to their
personal data. If the request is approved by the data controller user
operating the Fides web application, the data subject's personal data
can then retrieved from connected systems and data stores before being
bundled together as a data subject access request package for the data
subject to download. Supported data formats for the package include
json and csv, but the most commonly used format is a series of HTML
files compressed in a ZIP file. Once downloaded and unzipped, the data
subject user can browse the HTML files on their local machine. It was
identified that there was no validation of input coming from e.g. the
connected systems and data stores which is later reflected in the
downloaded data. This can result in an HTML injection that can be
abused e.g. for phishing attacks or malicious JavaScript code
execution, but only in the context of the data subject's browser
accessing a HTML page using the `file://` protocol. Exploitation is
limited to rogue Admin UI users, malicious connected system / data
store users, and the data subject user if tricked via social
engineering into submitting malicious data themselves. This
vulnerability has been patched in version 2.23.3.

Label Studio is an a popular open source data labeling tool. Versions
prior to 1.9.2 have a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that
could be exploited when an authenticated user uploads a crafted image
file for their avatar that gets rendered as a HTML file on the
website. Executing arbitrary JavaScript could result in an attacker
performing malicious actions on Label Studio users if they visit the
crafted avatar image. For an example, an attacker can craft a
JavaScript payload that adds a new Django Super Administrator user if
a Django administrator visits the image. The file `users/functions.py`
lines 18-49 show that the only verification check is that the file is
an image by extracting the dimensions from the file. Label Studio
serves avatar images using Django's built-in `serve` view, which is
not secure for production use according to Django's documentation. The
issue with the Django `serve` view is that it determines the `Content-
Type` of the response by the file extension in the URL path.
Therefore, an attacker can upload an image that contains malicious
HTML code and name the file with a `.html` extension to be rendered as
a HTML page. The only file extension validation is performed on the
client-side, which can be easily bypassed. Version 1.9.2 fixes this
issue. Other remediation strategies include validating the file
extension on the server side, not in client-side code; removing the
use of Django's `serve` view and implement a secure controller for
viewing uploaded avatar images; saving file content in the database
rather than on the filesystem to mitigate against other file related
vulnerabilities; and avoiding trusting user controlled inputs.

Label Studio is a popular open source data labeling tool. The
vulnerability affects all versions of Label Studio prior to 1.11.0 and
was tested on version 1.8.2. Label Studio's SSRF protections that can
be enabled by setting the `SSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED` environment
variable can be bypassed to access internal web servers. This is
because the current SSRF validation is done by executing a single DNS
lookup to verify that the IP address is not in an excluded subnet
range. This protection can be bypassed by either using HTTP
redirection or performing a DNS rebinding attack.

Label Studio is an open source data labeling tool. In all current
versions of Label Studio prior to 1.9.2post0, the application allows
users to insecurely set filters for filtering tasks. An attacker can
construct a filter chain to filter tasks based on sensitive fields for
all user accounts on the platform by exploiting Django's Object
Relational Mapper (ORM). Since the results of query can be manipulated
by the ORM filter, an attacker can leak these sensitive fields
character by character. In addition, Label Studio had a hard coded
secret key that an attacker can use to forge a session token of any
user by exploiting this ORM Leak vulnerability to leak account
password hashes. This vulnerability has been addressed in commit
`f931d9d129` which is included in the 1.9.2post0 release. Users are
advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

Piccolo is an object-relational mapping and query builder which
supports asyncio. Prior to version 1.1.1, the handling of named
transaction `savepoints` in all database implementations is vulnerable
to SQL Injection via f-strings. While the likelihood of an end
developer exposing a `savepoints` `name` parameter to a user is highly
unlikely, it would not be unheard of. If a malicious user was able to
abuse this functionality they would have essentially direct access to
the database and the ability to modify data to the level of
permissions associated with the database user. A non exhaustive list
of actions possible based on database permissions is: Read all data
stored in the database, including usernames and password hashes;
insert arbitrary data into the database, including modifying existing
records; and gain a shell on the underlying server. Version 1.1.1
fixes this issue.

Deserialization of untrusted data in IPC and Parquet readers in
PyArrow versions 0.14.0 to 14.0.0 allows arbitrary code execution. An
application is vulnerable if it reads Arrow IPC, Feather or Parquet
data from untrusted sources (for example user-supplied input files).
This vulnerability only affects PyArrow, not other Apache Arrow
implementations or bindings. It is recommended that users of PyArrow
upgrade to 14.0.1. Similarly, it is recommended that downstream
libraries upgrade their dependency requirements to PyArrow 14.0.1 or
later. PyPI packages are already available, and we hope that conda-
forge packages will be available soon. If it is not possible to
upgrade, we provide a separate package `pyarrow-hotfix` that disables
the vulnerability on older PyArrow versions. See
https://pypi.org/project/pyarrow-hotfix/ for instructions.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/21/2

Apache Airflow, versions 2.6.0 through 2.7.3 has a stored XSS
vulnerability that allows a DAG author to add an unbounded and not-
sanitized javascript in the parameter description field of the DAG.
This Javascript can be executed on the client side of any of the user
who looks at the tasks in the browser sandbox. While this issue does
not allow to exit the browser sandbox or manipulation of the server-
side data - more than the DAG author already has, it allows to modify
what the user looking at the DAG details sees in the browser - which
opens up all kinds of possibilities of misleading other users. Users
of Apache Airflow are recommended to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or newer
to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability

======================================================
Name: CVE-2023-47313
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://boltonshield.com/en/cve/cve-2023-47313/

Headwind MDM Web panel 5.22.1 is vulnerable to Directory Traversal.
The application uses an API call to move the uploaded temporary file
to the file directory during the file upload process. This API call
receives two input parameters, such as path and localPath. The first
one refers to the temporary file with an absolute path without
validating it. Attackers may modify this API call by referring to
arbitrary files. As a result, arbitrary files can be moved to the
files directory and so they can be downloaded.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2023-47314
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://boltonshield.com/en/cve/cve-2023-47314/

Headwind MDM Web panel 5.22.1 is vulnerable to cross-site scripting
(XSS). The file upload function allows APK and arbitrary files to be
uploaded. By exploiting this issue, attackers may upload HTML files
and share the download URL pointing to these files with the victims.
As the file download function returns the file in inline mode, the
victim&#8217;s browser will immediately render the content of the HTML file
as a web page. As a result, the uploaded client-side code will be
evaluated and executed in the victim&#8217;s browser, allowing attackers to
perform common XSS attacks.

Arbitrary File Overwrite in Eclipse JGit <= 6.6.0 In Eclipse JGit, all
versions <= 6.6.0.202305301015-r, a symbolic link present in a
specially crafted git repository can be used to write a file to
locations outside the working tree when this repository is cloned with
JGit to a case-insensitive filesystem, or when a checkout from a clone
of such a repository is performed on a case-insensitive filesystem.
This can happen on checkout (DirCacheCheckout), merge (ResolveMerger
via its WorkingTreeUpdater), pull (PullCommand using merge), and when
applying a patch (PatchApplier). This can be exploited for remote code
execution (RCE), for instance if the file written outside the working
tree is a git filter that gets executed on a subsequent git command.
The issue occurs only on case-insensitive filesystems, like the
default filesystems on Windows and macOS. The user performing the
clone or checkout must have the rights to create symbolic links for
the problem to occur, and symbolic links must be enabled in the git
configuration. Setting git configuration option core.symlinks = false
before checking out avoids the problem. The issue was fixed in Eclipse
JGit version 6.6.1.202309021850-r and 6.7.0.202309050840-r, available
via Maven Central https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/eclipse/jgit/ and
repo.eclipse.org https://repo.eclipse.org/content/repositories/jgit-
releases/ . A backport is available in 5.13.3 starting from
5.13.3.202401111512-r. The JGit maintainers would like to thank RyotaK
for finding and reporting this issue.

In Eclipse RAP versions from 3.0.0 up to and including 3.25.0, Remote
Code Execution is possible on Windows when using the FileUpload
component. The reason for this is a not completely secure extraction
of the file name in the FileUploadProcessor.stripFileName(String name)
method. As soon as this finds a / in the path, everything before it is
removed, but potentially \ (backslashes) coming further back are kept.
For example, a file name such as /..\..\webapps\shell.war can be used
to upload a file to a Tomcat server under Windows, which is then saved
as ..\..\webapps\shell.war in its webapps directory and can then be
executed.

DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. DataHub Frontend's
sessions are configured using Play Framework's default settings for
stateless session which do not set an expiration time for a cookie.
Due to this, if a session cookie were ever leaked, it would be valid
forever. DataHub uses a stateless session cookie that is not
invalidated on logout, it is just removed from the browser forcing the
user to login again. However, if an attacker extracted a cookie from
an authenticated user it would continue to be valid as there is no
validation on a time window the session token is valid for due to a
combination of the usage of LegacyCookiesModule from Play Framework
and using default settings which do not set an expiration time. All
DataHub instances prior to the patch that have removed the datahub
user, but not the default policies applying to that user are affected.
Users are advised to update to version 0.12.1 which addresses the
issue. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. An issue was found
in Kyverno that allowed an attacker to control the digest of images
used by Kyverno users. The issue would require the attacker to
compromise the registry that the Kyverno users fetch their images
from. The attacker could then return an vulnerable image to the the
user and leverage that to further escalate their position. As such,
the attacker would need to know which images the Kyverno user consumes
and know of one of multiple exploitable vulnerabilities in previous
digests of the images. Alternatively, if the attacker has compromised
the registry, they could craft a malicious image with a different
digest with intentionally placed vulnerabilities and deliver the image
to the user. Users pulling their images by digests and from trusted
registries are not impacted by this vulnerability. There is no
evidence of this being exploited in the wild. The issue has been
patched in 1.10.5. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this vulnerability.

vantage6 is a framework to manage and deploy privacy enhancing
technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation
(MPC). In affected versions a node does not check if an image is
allowed to run if a `parent_id` is set. A malicious party that
breaches the server may modify it to set a fake `parent_id` and send a
task of a non-whitelisted algorithm. The node will then execute it
because the `parent_id` that is set prevents checks from being run.
This impacts all servers that are breached by an expert user. This
vulnerability has been patched in version 4.1.2. All users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

The Pimcore Admin Classic Bundle provides a Backend UI for Pimcore.
Full Path Disclosure (FPD) vulnerabilities enable the attacker to see
the path to the webroot/file. e.g.: /home/omg/htdocs/file/. Certain
vulnerabilities, such as using the load_file() (within a SQL
Injection) query to view the page source, require the attacker to have
the full path to the file they wish to view. In the case of pimcore,
the fopen() function here doesn't have an error handle when the file
doesn't exist on the server so the server response raises the full
path "fopen(/var/www/html/var/tmp/export-{ uniqe id}.csv)". This issue
has been patched in commit `10d178ef771` which has been included in
release version 1.2.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Pimcore is an Open Source Data & Experience Management Platform. In
affected versions the `/admin/object/grid-proxy` endpoint calls
`getFilterCondition()` on fields of classes to be filtered for,
passing input from the request, and later executes the returned SQL.
One implementation of `getFilterCondition()` is in `Multiselect`,
which does not normalize/escape/validate the passed value. Any backend
user with very basic permissions can execute arbitrary SQL statements
and thus alter any data or escalate their privileges to at least admin
level. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 11.1.1. Users
are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/datahub-project/datahub/security/advisories/GHSA-fg9x-wvqw-6gmw

DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. The HMAC signature for
DataHub Frontend sessions was being signed using a SHA-1 HMAC with the
frontend secret key. SHA1 with a 10 byte key can be brute forced using
sufficient resources (i.e. state level actors with large computational
capabilities). DataHub Frontend was utilizing the Play
LegacyCookiesModule with default settings which utilizes a SHA1 HMAC
for signing. This is compounded by using a shorter key length than
recommended by default for the signing key for the randomized secret
value. An authenticated attacker (or attacker who has otherwise
obtained a session token) could crack the signing key for DataHub and
obtain escalated privileges by generating a privileged session cookie.
Due to key length being a part of the risk, deployments should update
to the latest helm chart and rotate their session signing secret. All
deployments using the default helm chart configurations for generating
the Play secret key used for signing are affected by this
vulnerability. Version 0.11.1 resolves this vulnerability. All users
are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio
and Python. Affected versions of aiohttp have a security vulnerability
regarding the inconsistent interpretation of the http protocol.
HTTP/1.1 is a persistent protocol, if both Content-Length(CL) and
Transfer-Encoding(TE) header values are present it can lead to
incorrect interpretation of two entities that parse the HTTP and we
can poison other sockets with this incorrect interpretation. A
possible Proof-of-Concept (POC) would be a configuration with a
reverse proxy(frontend) that accepts both CL and TE headers and
aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything with chunked, we can
pass a chunked123 as TE, the frontend entity will ignore this header
and will parse Content-Length. The impact of this vulnerability is
that it is possible to bypass any proxy rule, poisoning sockets to
other users like passing Authentication Headers, also if it is present
an Open Redirect an attacker could combine it to redirect random users
to another website and log the request. This vulnerability has been
addressed in release 3.8.0 of aiohttp. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. It was discovered by
the Zulip development team that active users who had previously been
subscribed to a stream incorrectly continued being able to use the
Zulip API to access metadata for that stream. As a result, users who
had been removed from a stream, but still had an account in the
organization, could still view metadata for that stream (including the
stream name, description, settings, and an email address used to send
emails into the stream via the incoming email integration). This
potentially allowed users to see changes to a stream&#8217;s metadata after
they had lost access to the stream. This vulnerability has been
addressed in version 7.5 and all users are advised to upgrade. There
are no known workarounds for this issue.

Issue summary: The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code)
implementation contains a bug that might corrupt the internal state of
applications on the Windows 64 platform when running on newer X86_64
processors supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. Impact summary: If
in an application that uses the OpenSSL library an attacker can
influence whether the POLY1305 MAC algorithm is used, the application
state might be corrupted with various application dependent
consequences. The POLY1305 MAC (message authentication code)
implementation in OpenSSL does not save the contents of non-volatile
XMM registers on Windows 64 platform when calculating the MAC of data
larger than 64 bytes. Before returning to the caller all the XMM
registers are set to zero rather than restoring their previous
content. The vulnerable code is used only on newer x86_64 processors
supporting the AVX512-IFMA instructions. The consequences of this kind
of internal application state corruption can be various - from no
consequences, if the calling application does not depend on the
contents of non-volatile XMM registers at all, to the worst
consequences, where the attacker could get complete control of the
application process. However given the contents of the registers are
just zeroized so the attacker cannot put arbitrary values inside, the
most likely consequence, if any, would be an incorrect result of some
application dependent calculations or a crash leading to a denial of
service. The POLY1305 MAC algorithm is most frequently used as part of
the CHACHA20-POLY1305 AEAD (authenticated encryption with associated
data) algorithm. The most common usage of this AEAD cipher is with TLS
protocol versions 1.2 and 1.3 and a malicious client can influence
whether this AEAD cipher is used by the server. This implies that
server applications using OpenSSL can be potentially impacted. However
we are currently not aware of any concrete application that would be
affected by this issue therefore we consider this a Low severity
security issue. As a workaround the AVX512-IFMA instructions support
can be disabled at runtime by setting the environment variable
OPENSSL_ia32cap: OPENSSL_ia32cap=:~0x200000 The FIPS provider is not
affected by this issue.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/08/6

In pf packet processing with a 'scrub fragment reassemble' rule, a
packet containing multiple IPv6 fragment headers would be reassembled,
and then immediately processed. That is, a packet with multiple
fragment extension headers would not be recognized as the correct
ultimate payload. Instead a packet with multiple IPv6 fragment headers
would unexpectedly be interpreted as a fragmented packet, rather than
as whatever the real payload is. As a result, IPv6 fragments may
bypass pf firewall rules written on the assumption all fragments have
been reassembled and, as a result, be forwarded or processed by the
host.

TinyMCE is an open source rich text editor. A mutation cross-site
scripting (mXSS) vulnerability was discovered in TinyMCE&#8217;s core
undo/redo functionality and other APIs and plugins. Text nodes within
specific parents are not escaped upon serialization according to the
HTML standard. If such text nodes contain a special character reserved
as an internal marker, they can be combined with other HTML patterns
to form malicious snippets. These snippets pass the initial
sanitisation layer when the content is parsed into the editor body,
but can trigger XSS when the special internal marker is removed from
the content and re-parsed. his vulnerability has been patched in
TinyMCE versions 6.7.3 and 5.10.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There
are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
The vulnerability impacts Grafana instances with several
organizations, and allows a user with Organization Admin permissions
in one organization to change the permissions associated with
Organization Viewer, Organization Editor and Organization Admin roles
in all organizations. It also allows an Organization Admin to assign
or revoke any permissions that they have to any user globally. This
means that any Organization Admin can elevate their own permissions in
any organization that they are already a member of, or elevate or
restrict the permissions of any other user. The vulnerability does not
allow a user to become a member of an organization that they are not
already a member of, or to add any other users to an organization that
the current user is not a member of.

Decidim is a participatory democracy framework. Starting in version
0.4.rc3 and prior to version 2.0.9 of the `devise_invitable` gem, the
invites feature allows users to accept the invitation for an unlimited
amount of time through the password reset functionality. This issue
creates vulnerable dependencies starting in version 0.0.1.alpha3 and
prior to versions 0.26.9, 0.27.5, and 0.28.0 of the `decidim,`
`decidim-admin`, and `decidim-system` gems. When using the password
reset functionality, the `devise_invitable` gem always accepts the
pending invitation if the user has been invited. The only check done
is if the user has been invited but the code does not ensure that the
pending invitation is still valid as defined by the `invite_for`
expiry period. Decidim sets this configuration to `2.weeks` so this
configuration should be respected. The bug is in the
`devise_invitable` gem and should be fixed there and the dependency
should be upgraded in Decidim once the fix becomes available.
`devise_invitable` to version `2.0.9` and above fix this issue.
Versions 0.26.9, 0.27.5, and 0.28.0 of the `decidim,` `decidim-admin`,
and `decidim-system` gems contain this fix. As a workaround,
invitations can be cancelled directly from the database.

fast-jwt provides fast JSON Web Token (JWT) implementation. Prior to
version 3.3.2, the fast-jwt library does not properly prevent JWT
algorithm confusion for all public key types. The
'publicKeyPemMatcher' in 'fast-jwt/src/crypto.js' does not properly
match all common PEM formats for public keys. To exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker needs to craft a malicious JWT token
containing the HS256 algorithm, signed with the public RSA key of the
victim application. This attack will only work if the victim
application utilizes a public key containing the `BEGIN RSA PUBLIC
KEY` header. Applications using the RS256 algorithm, a public key with
a `BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY` header, and calling the verify function
without explicitly providing an algorithm, are vulnerable to this
algorithm confusion attack which allows attackers to sign arbitrary
payloads which will be accepted by the verifier. Version 3.3.2
contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, change line 29 of
`blob/master/src/crypto.js` to include a regular expression.

Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the
fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the
enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides Privacy Center
allows data subject users to submit privacy and consent requests to
data controller users of the Fides web application. Privacy requests
allow data subjects to submit a request to access all person data held
by the data controller, or delete/erase it. Consent request allows
data subject users to modify their privacy preferences for how the
data controller uses their personal data e.g. data sales and sharing
consent opt-in/opt-out. If `subject_identity_verification_required` in
the `[execution]` section of `fides.toml` or the env var
`FIDES__EXECUTION__SUBJECT_IDENTITY_VERIFICATION_REQUIRED` is set to
`True` on the fides webserver backend, data subjects are sent a one-
time code to their email address or phone number, depending on
messaging configuration, and the one-time code must be entered in the
Privacy Center UI by the data subject before the privacy or consent
request is submitted. It was identified that the one-time code values
for these requests were generated by the python `random` module, a
cryptographically weak pseduo-random number generator (PNRG). If an
attacker generates several hundred consecutive one-time codes, this
vulnerability allows the attacker to predict all future one-time code
values during the lifetime of the backend python process. There is no
security impact on data access requests as the personal data download
package is not shared in the Privacy Center itself. However, this
vulnerability allows an attacker to (i) submit a verified data erasure
request, resulting in deletion of data for the targeted user and (ii)
submit a verified consent request, modifying a user's privacy
preferences. The vulnerability has been patched in Fides version
`2.24.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to this version or later to
secure their systems against this threat. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

Laf is a cloud development platform. Prior to version 1.0.0-beta.13,
the control of LAF app enV is not strict enough, and in certain
scenarios of privatization environment, it may lead to sensitive
information leakage in secret and configmap. In ES6 syntax, if an obj
directly references another obj, the name of the obj itself will be
used as the key, and the entire object structure will be integrated
intact. When constructing the deployment instance of the app, env was
found from the database and directly inserted into the template,
resulting in controllability here. Sensitive information in the secret
and configmap can be read through the k8s envFrom field. In a
privatization environment, when `namespaceConf. fixed` is marked, it
may lead to the leakage of sensitive information in the system. As of
time of publication, it is unclear whether any patches or workarounds
exist.

authentik is an open-source identity provider. When initialising a
oauth2 flow with a `code_challenge` and `code_method` (thus requesting
PKCE), the single sign-on provider (authentik) must check if there is
a matching and existing `code_verifier` during the token step. Prior
to versions 2023.10.4 and 2023.8.5, authentik checks if the contents
of `code_verifier` is matching only when it is provided. When it is
left out completely, authentik simply accepts the token request with
out it; even when the flow was started with a `code_challenge`.
authentik 2023.8.5 and 2023.10.4 fix this issue.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
Next-Generation IoT devices. An out-of-bounds write exists in the
driver for IEEE 802.15.4 radios on nRF platforms in the Contiki-NG
operating system. The problem is triggered when parsing radio frames
in the `read_frame` function in the `arch/cpu/nrf/net/nrf-ieee-driver-
arch.c` module. More specifically, the `read_frame` function performs
an incomplete validation of the payload length of the packet, which is
a value that can be set by an external party that sends radio packets
to a Contiki-NG system. Although the value is validated to be in the
range of the MTU length, it is not validated to fit into the given
buffer into which the packet will be copied. The problem has been
patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG and is expected to be
included in subsequent releases. Users are advised to update their
develop branch or to update to a subsequent release when available.
Users unable to upgrade should consider manually applying the changes
in PR #2741.

Cap'n Proto is a data interchange format and capability-based RPC
system. In versions 1.0 and 1.0.1, when using the KJ HTTP library with
WebSocket compression enabled, a buffer underrun can be caused by a
remote peer. The underrun always writes a constant value that is not
attacker-controlled, likely resulting in a crash, enabling a remote
denial-of-service attack. Most Cap'n Proto and KJ users are unlikely
to have this functionality enabled and so unlikely to be affected.
Maintainers suspect only the Cloudflare Workers Runtime is affected.
If KJ HTTP is used with WebSocket compression enabled, a malicious
peer may be able to cause a buffer underrun on a heap-allocated
buffer. KJ HTTP is an optional library bundled with Cap'n Proto, but
is not directly used by Cap'n Proto. WebSocket compression is disabled
by default. It must be enabled via a setting passed to the KJ HTTP
library via `HttpClientSettings` or `HttpServerSettings`. The bytes
written out-of-bounds are always a specific constant 4-byte string `{
0x00, 0x00, 0xFF, 0xFF }`. Because this string is not controlled by
the attacker, maintainers believe it is unlikely that remote code
execution is possible. However, it cannot be ruled out. This
functionality first appeared in Cap'n Proto 1.0. Previous versions are
not affected. This issue is fixed in Cap'n Proto 1.0.1.1.

joaquimserafim/json-web-token is a javascript library use to interact
with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) which are a compact URL-safe means of
representing claims to be transferred between two parties. Affected
versions of the json-web-token library are vulnerable to a JWT
algorithm confusion attack. On line 86 of the 'index.js' file, the
algorithm to use for verifying the signature of the JWT token is taken
from the JWT token, which at that point is still unverified and thus
shouldn't be trusted. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs
to craft a malicious JWT token containing the HS256 algorithm, signed
with the public RSA key of the victim application. This attack will
only work against this library is the RS256 algorithm is in use,
however it is a best practice to use that algorithm.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. The rendered diff in XWiki
embeds images to be able to compare the contents and not display a
difference for an actually unchanged image. For this, XWiki requests
all embedded images on the server side. These requests are also sent
for images from other domains and include all cookies that were sent
in the original request to ensure that images with restricted view
right can be compared. Starting in version 11.10.1 and prior to
versions 14.10.15, 15.5.1, and 15.6, this allows an attacker to steal
login and session cookies that allow impersonating the current user
who views the diff. The attack can be triggered with an image that
references the rendered diff, thus making it easy to trigger. Apart
from stealing login cookies, this also allows server-side request
forgery (the result of any successful request is returned in the
image's source) and viewing protected content as once a resource is
cached, it is returned for all users. As only successful requests are
cached, the cache will be filled by the first user who is allowed to
access the resource. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.15, 15.5.1
and 15.6. The rendered diff now only downloads images from trusted
domains. Further, cookies are only sent when the image's domain is the
same the requested domain. The cache has been changed to be specific
for each user. As a workaround, the image embedding feature can be
disabled by deleting `xwiki-platform-diff-xml-<version>.jar` in `WEB-
INF/lib/`.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform. Starting in version
6.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 14.10.15, 15.5.1, and 15.6RC1,
the Solr-based search suggestion provider that also duplicates as
generic JavaScript API for search results in XWiki exposes the content
of all documents of all wikis to anybody who has access to it, by
default it is public. This exposes all information stored in the wiki
(but not some protected information like password hashes). While there
is a right check normally, the right check can be circumvented by
explicitly requesting fields from Solr that don't include the data for
the right check. This has been fixed in XWiki 15.6RC1, 15.5.1 and
14.10.15 by not listing documents whose rights cannot be checked. No
known workarounds are available.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/21/1

Apache Airflow, in versions prior to 2.8.0, contains a security
vulnerability that allows an authenticated user with limited access to
some DAGs, to craft a request that could give the user write access to
various DAG resources for DAGs that the user had no access to, thus,
enabling the user to clear DAGs they shouldn't. This is a missing fix
for CVE-2023-42792 in Apache Airflow 2.7.2 Users of Apache Airflow are
strongly advised to upgrade to version 2.8.0 or newer to mitigate the
risk associated with this vulnerability.

Reference: URL:https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/ADMINTOOL-91

The XWiki Admin Tools Application provides tools to help the
administration of XWiki. Starting in version 4.4 and prior to version
4.5.1, a cross site request forgery vulnerability in the admin tool
for executing shell commands on the server allows an attacker to
execute arbitrary shell commands by tricking an admin into loading the
URL with the shell command. A very simple possibility for an attack
are comments. When the attacker can leave a comment on any page in the
wiki it is sufficient to include an image with an URL like
`/xwiki/bin/view/Admin/RunShellCommand?command=touch%20/tmp/attacked`
in the comment. When an admin views the comment, the file
`/tmp/attacked` will be created on the server. The output of the
command is also vulnerable to XWiki syntax injection which offers a
simple way to execute Groovy in the context of the XWiki installation
and thus an even easier way to compromise the integrity and
confidentiality of the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched
by adding a form token check in version 4.5.1 of the admin tools. Some
workarounds are available. The patch can be applied manually to the
affected wiki pages. Alternatively, the document
`Admin.RunShellCommand` can also be deleted if the possibility to run
shell commands isn't needed.

The XWiki Admin Tools Application provides tools to help the
administration of XWiki. Prior to version 4.5.1, a cross-site request
forgery vulnerability in the query on XWiki tool allows executing
arbitrary database queries on the database of the XWiki installation.
Among other things, this allows modifying and deleting all data of the
wiki. This could be both used to damage the wiki and to create an
account with elevated privileges for the attacker, thus impacting the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki
instance. A possible attack vector are comments on the wiki, by
embedding an image with wiki syntax like `[[image:path:/xwiki/bin/view
/Admin/QueryOnXWiki?query=DELETE%20FROM%20xwikidoc]]`, all documents
would be deleted from the database when an admin user views this
comment. This has been patched in Admin Tools Application 4.5.1 by
adding form token checks. Some workarounds are available. The patch
can also be applied manually to the affected pages. Alternatively, if
the query tool is not needed, by deleting the document
`Admin.SQLToolsGroovy`, all database query tools can be deactivated.

LibreNMS is an auto-discovering PHP/MySQL/SNMP based network
monitoring which includes support for a wide range of network hardware
and operating systems. In affected versions of LibreNMS when a user
accesses their device dashboard, one request is sent to `graph.php` to
access graphs generated on the particular Device. This request can be
accessed by a low privilege user and they can enumerate devices on
librenms with their id or hostname. Leveraging this vulnerability a
low privilege user can see all devices registered by admin users. This
vulnerability has been addressed in commit `489978a923` which has been
included in release version 23.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

TorchServe is a tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models in
production. Starting in version 0.1.0 and prior to version 0.9.0,
using the model/workflow management API, there is a chance of
uploading potentially harmful archives that contain files that are
extracted to any location on the filesystem that is within the process
permissions. Leveraging this issue could aid third-party actors in
hiding harmful code in open-source/public models, which can be
downloaded from the internet, and take advantage of machines running
Torchserve. The ZipSlip issue in TorchServe has been fixed by
validating the paths of files contained within a zip archive before
extracting them. TorchServe release 0.9.0 includes fixes to address
the ZipSlip vulnerability.

NextAuth.js provides authentication for Next.js. `next-auth`
applications prior to version 4.24.5 that rely on the default
Middleware authorization are affected by a vulnerability. A bad actor
could create an empty/mock user, by getting hold of a NextAuth.js-
issued JWT from an interrupted OAuth sign-in flow (state, PKCE or
nonce). Manually overriding the `next-auth.session-token` cookie value
with this non-related JWT would let the user simulate a logged in
user, albeit having no user information associated with it. (The only
property on this user is an opaque randomly generated string). This
vulnerability does not give access to other users' data, neither to
resources that require proper authorization via scopes or other means.
The created mock user has no information associated with it (ie. no
name, email, access_token, etc.) This vulnerability can be exploited
by bad actors to peek at logged in user states (e.g. dashboard
layout). `next-auth` `v4.24.5` contains a patch for the vulnerability.
As a workaround, using a custom authorization callback for Middleware,
developers can manually do a basic authentication.

TestingPlatform is a testing platform for Internet Security Standards.
Prior to version 2.1.1, user input is not filtered correctly. Nmap
options are accepted. In this particular case, the option to create
log files is accepted in addition to a host name (and even without). A
log file is created at the location specified. These files are created
as root. If the file exists, the existing file is being rendered
useless. This can result in denial of service. Additionally, input for
scanning can be any CIDR blocks passed to nmap. An attacker can scan
0.0.0.0/0 or even local networks. Version 2.1.1 contains a patch for
this issue.

capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for the capsule operator project.
Affected versions are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability
which is based on a missing check if the user is authenticated based
on the `TokenReview` result. All the clusters running with the
`anonymous-auth` Kubernetes API Server setting disable (set to
`false`) are affected since it would be possible to bypass the token
review mechanism, interacting with the upper Kubernetes API Server.
This privilege escalation cannot be exploited if you're relying only
on client certificates (SSL/TLS). This vulnerability has been
addressed in version 0.4.6. Users are advised to upgrade.
