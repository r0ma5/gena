Hirschmann OS2, RSP, and RSPE devices before HiOS 08.3.00 allow a
denial of service. An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can cause an
infinite loop on one of the HSR ring ports of the device. This
effectively breaks the redundancy of the HSR ring. If the attacker can
perform the same attack on a second device, the ring is broken into
two parts (thus disrupting communication between devices in the
different parts).

Name: CVE-2020-9309
Status: Candidate
Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2020-9309

Silverstripe CMS through 4.5 can be susceptible to script execution
from malicious upload contents under allowed file extensions (for
example HTML code in a TXT file). When these files are stored as
protected or draft files, the MIME detection can cause browsers to
execute the file contents. Uploads stored as protected or draft files
are allowed by default for authorised users only, but can also be
enabled through custom logic as well as modules such as
silverstripe/userforms. Sites using the previously optional
silverstripe/mimevalidator module can configure MIME whitelists rather
than extension whitelists, and hence prevent this issue. Sites on the
Common Web Platform (CWP) use this module by default, and are not
affected.

Certain Xerox WorkCentre printers before 073.xxx.000.02300 do not
require the user to reenter or validate LDAP bind credentials when
changing the LDAP connector IP address. A malicious actor who gains
access to affected devices (e.g., by using default credentials) can
change the LDAP connection IP address to a system owned by the actor
without knowledge of the LDAP bind credentials. After changing the
LDAP connection IP address, subsequent authentication attempts will
result in the printer sending plaintext LDAP (Active Directory)
credentials to the actor. Although the credentials may belong to a
non-privileged user, organizations frequently use privileged service
accounts to bind to Active Directory. The attacker gains a foothold on
the Active Directory domain at a minimum, and may use the credentials
to take over control of the Active Directory domain. This affects
3655*, 3655i*, 58XX*, 58XXi*, 59XX*, 59XXi*, 6655**, 6655i**, 72XX*,

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/02/25/6

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel 5.4 and 5.5 through 5.5.6
on the AArch64 architecture. It ignores the top byte in the address
passed to the brk system call, potentially moving the memory break
downwards when the application expects it to move upwards, aka CID-
dcde237319e6. This has been observed to cause heap corruption with the
GNU C Library malloc implementation.

An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510.
anti_ransomware_service.exe exposes a REST API that can be used by
everyone, even unprivileged users. This API is used to communicate

An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510.
anti_ransomware_service.exe keeps a log in a folder where unprivileged
users have write permissions. The logs are generated in a predictable
pattern, allowing an unprivileged user to create a hardlink from a
(not yet created) log file to anti_ransomware_service.exe. On reboot,
this forces the anti_ransomware_service to try to write its log into
its own process, crashing in a SHARING VIOLATION. This crash occurs on
every reboot.

An issue was discovered in Acronis True Image 2020 24.5.22510.
anti_ransomware_service.exe includes functionality to quarantine files
by copying a suspected ransomware file from one directory to another
using SYSTEM privileges. Because unprivileged users have write
permissions in the quarantine folder, it is possible to control this
privileged write with a hardlink. This means that an unprivileged user
can write/overwrite arbitrary files in arbitrary folders. Escalating
privileges to SYSTEM is trivial with arbitrary writes. While the
quarantine feature is not enabled by default, it can be forced to copy
the file to the quarantine by communicating with
anti_ransomware_service.exe through its REST API.

Reference: MISC:https://www.hooperlabs.xyz/disclosures/cve-2020-9470.php

An issue was discovered in Wing FTP Server 6.2.5 before February 2020.
Due to insecure permissions when handling session cookies, a local
user may view the contents of the session and session_admin
directories, which expose active session cookies within the Wing FTP
HTTP interface and administration panel. These cookies may be used to
hijack user and administrative sessions, including the ability to
execute Lua commands as root within the administration panel.

In Apache Spark 2.4.5 and earlier, a standalone resource manager's
master may be configured to require authentication
(spark.authenticate) via a shared secret. When enabled, however, a
specially-crafted RPC to the master can succeed in starting an
application's resources on the Spark cluster, even without the shared
key. This can be leveraged to execute shell commands on the host
machine. This does not affect Spark clusters using other resource
managers (YARN, Mesos, etc).

server is configured to use the PersistenceManager with a FileStore;
and c) the PersistenceManager is configured with
sessionAttributeValueClassNameFilter="null" (the default unless a
SecurityManager is used) or a sufficiently lax filter to allow the
attacker provided object to be deserialized; and d) the attacker knows
the relative file path from the storage location used by FileStore to
the file the attacker has control over; then, using a specifically
crafted request, the attacker will be able to trigger remote code
execution via deserialization of the file under their control. Note
that all of conditions a) to d) must be true for the attack to
succeed.

Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in Apache Log4j
SMTP appender. This could allow an SMTPS connection to be intercepted
by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log messages sent
through that appender. Fixed in Apache Log4j 2.12.3 and 2.13.1

Reference: URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r4cbc3f6981cd0a1a482531df9d44e4c42a7f63342a7ba78b7bff8a1b@%3Cnotifications.james.apache.org%3E

A carefully crafted or corrupt file may trigger a System.exit in
Tika's OneNote Parser. Crafted or corrupted files can also cause out
of memory errors and/or infinite loops in Tika's ICNSParser,
MP3Parser, MP4Parser, SAS7BDATParser, OneNoteParser and ImageParser.
Apache Tika users should upgrade to 1.24.1 or later. The
vulnerabilities in the MP4Parser were partially fixed by upgrading the
com.googlecode:isoparser:1.1.22 dependency to
org.tallison:isoparser:1.9.41.2. For unrelated security reasons, we
upgraded org.apache.cxf to 3.3.6 as part of the 1.24.1 release.

Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43. A specially crafted
value for the 'Cache-Digest' header in a HTTP/2 request would result
in a crash when the server actually tries to HTTP/2 PUSH a resource
afterwards. Configuring the HTTP/2 feature via "H2Push off" will
mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

In Apache NiFi 1.2.0 to 1.11.4, the NiFi UI and API were protected by
mandating TLS v1.2, as well as listening connections established by
processors like ListenHTTP, HandleHttpRequest, etc. However
intracluster communication such as cluster request replication, Site-
to-Site, and load balanced queues continued to support TLS v1.0 or
v1.1.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/19/1

Apache Archiva login service before 2.2.5 is vulnerable to LDAP
injection. A attacker is able to retrieve user attribute data from the
connected LDAP server by providing special values to the login form.
With certain characters it is possible to modify the LDAP filter used
to query the LDAP users. By measuring the response time for the login
request, arbitrary attribute data can be retrieved from LDAP user
objects.

A NULL Pointer Dereference vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS

An improper interpretation conflict of certain data between certain
software components within the Juniper Networks Junos OS devices does
not allow certain traffic to pass through the device upon receipt from
an ingress interface filtering certain specific types of traffic which
is then being redirected to an egress interface on a different VLAN.
This causes a Denial of Service (DoS) to those clients sending these
particular types of traffic. Such traffic being sent by a client may
appear genuine, but is non-standard in nature and should be considered
as potentially malicious, and can be targeted to the device, or
destined through it for the issue to occur. This issues affects IPv4
and IPv6 traffic. An indicator of compromise may be found by checking
log files. You may find that traffic on the input interface has 100%
of traffic flowing into the device, yet the egress interface shows 0
pps leaving the device. For example: [show interfaces "interface"
statistics detail] Output between two interfaces would reveal
something similar to: Ingress, first interface: --------------------
Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets (pps) et-0/0/0 Up
9999999999 (9999) 1 (0) -------------------- Egress, second interface:
-------------------- Interface Link Input packets (pps) Output packets
(pps) et-0/0/1 Up 0 (0) 9999999999 (0) -------------------- Dropped
packets will not show up in DDoS monitoring/protection counters as
issue is not caused by anti-DDoS protection mechanisms. This issue

A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an attacker to
cause a Denial of Service (DoS) to the device by sending certain
crafted protocol packets from an adjacent device with invalid payloads
to the device. These crafted packets, which should be discarded, are
instead replicated and sent to the RE. Over time, a Denial of Service
(DoS) occurs. Continued receipt of these crafted protocol packets will
cause an extended Denial of Service (DoS) condition, which may cause
wider traffic impact due to protocol flapping. An indication of
compromise is to check "monitor interface traffic" on the ingress and
egress port packet counts. For each ingress packet, two duplicate
packets are seen on egress. This issue can be triggered by IPv4 and
IPv6 packets. This issue affects all traffic through the device. This

An uncontrolled resource consumption vulnerability in Message Queue
Telemetry Transport (MQTT) server of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows
an attacker to cause MQTT server to crash and restart leading to a

A buffer size validation vulnerability in the overlayd service of
Juniper Networks Junos OS may allow an unauthenticated remote attacker
to send specially crafted packets to the device, triggering a partial
Denial of Service (DoS) condition, or leading to remote code execution
(RCE). Continued receipt and processing of these packets will sustain
the partial DoS. The overlayd daemon handles Overlay OAM packets, such
as ping and traceroute, sent to the overlay. The service runs as root
by default and listens for UDP connections on port 4789. This issue
results from improper buffer size validation, which can lead to a
buffer overflow. Unauthenticated attackers can send specially crafted
packets to trigger this vulnerability, resulting in possible remote
code execution. overlayd runs by default in MX Series, ACX Series, and
QFX Series platforms. The SRX Series does not support VXLAN and is
therefore not vulnerable to this issue. Other platforms are also
vulnerable if a Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN) overlay network is

Due to a vulnerability in DDoS protection in Juniper Networks Junos OS
and Junos OS Evolved on QFX5K Series switches in a VXLAN
configuration, instability might be experienced in the underlay
network as a consequence of exceeding the default ddos-protection
aggregate threshold. If an attacker on a client device on the overlay
network sends a high volume of specific, legitimate traffic in the
overlay network, due to an improperly detected DDoS violation, the
leaf might not process certain L2 traffic, sent by spines in the
underlay network. Continued receipt and processing of the high volume
traffic will sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue

A Data Processing vulnerability in the Multi-Service process (multi-
svcs) on the FPC of Juniper Networks Junos OS on the PTX Series
routers may lead to the process becoming unresponsive, ultimately
affecting traffic forwarding, allowing an attacker to cause a Denial
of Service (DoS) condition . The Multi-Service Process running on the
FPC is responsible for handling sampling-related operations when a
J-Flow configuration is activated. This can occur during periods of
heavy route churn, causing the Multi-Service Process to stop
processing updates, without consuming any further updates from kernel.
This back pressure towards the kernel affects further dynamic updates
from other processes in the system, including RPD, causing a KRT-STUCK

Due to an Improper Initialization vulnerability in Juniper Networks
Junos OS on PTX platforms and QFX10K Series with Paradise (PE)
chipset-based line cards, ddos-protection configuration changes made
from the CLI will not take effect as expected beyond the default DDoS

When user-defined ARP Policer is configured and applied on one or more
Aggregated Ethernet (AE) interface units, a Time-of-check Time-of-use
(TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability between the Device Control
Daemon (DCD) and firewall process (dfwd) daemons of Juniper Networks
Junos OS allows an attacker to bypass the user-defined ARP Policer. In
this particular case the User ARP policer is replaced with default ARP
policer. To review the desired ARP Policers and actual state one can
run the command "show interfaces <> extensive" and review the output.
See further details below. An example output is: show interfaces
extensive | match policer Policer: Input: __default_arp_policer__ <<<
incorrect if user ARP Policer was applied on an AE interface and the
default ARP Policer is displayed Policer: Input: jtac-arp-

An Exposure of System Data vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS
and Junos OS Evolved, where a sensitive system-level resource is not
being sufficiently protected, allows a network-based unauthenticated
attacker to send specific traffic which partially reaches this
resource. A high rate of specific traffic may lead to a partial Denial
of Service (DoS) as the CPU utilization of the RE is significantly
increased. The SNMP Agent Extensibility (agentx) process should only
be listening to TCP port 705 on the internal routing instance.
External connections destined to port 705 should not be allowed. This

A vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS caused by Missing Release
of Memory after Effective Lifetime leads to a memory leak each time
the CLI command 'show system connections extensive' is executed. The
amount of memory leaked on each execution depends on the number of TCP
connections from and to the system. Repeated execution will cause more
memory to leak and eventually daemons that need to allocate
additionally memory and ultimately the kernel to crash, which will
result in traffic loss. Continued execution of this command will cause
a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An administrator can
use the following CLI command to monitor for increase in memory
consumption of the netstat process, if it exists: user@junos> show
system processes extensive | match "username|netstat" PID USERNAME PRI

A vulnerability in the Distance Vector Multicast Routing Protocol
(DVMRP) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on the QFX10K Series switches
allows an attacker to trigger a packet forwarding loop, leading to a
partial Denial of Service (DoS). The issue is caused by DVMRP packets
looping on a multi-homed Ethernet Segment Identifier (ESI) when VXLAN
is configured. DVMRP packets received on a multi-homed ESI are sent to
the peer, and then incorrectly forwarded out the same ESI, violating
the split horizon rule. This issue only affects QFX10K Series
switches, including the QFX10002, QFX10008, and QFX10016. Other
products and platforms are unaffected by this vulnerability. This

The path in this case is a little bit convoluted. The end result is
that via an ioctl an untrusted app can control the ui32PageIndex
offset in the expression:sPA.uiAddr =
page_to_phys(psOSPageArrayData->pagearray[ui32PageIndex]);With the
current PoC this crashes as an OOB read. However, given that the OOB
read value is ending up as the address field of a struct I think i
seems plausible that this could lead to an OOB write if the attacker
is able to cause the OOB read to pull an interesting kernel address.
Regardless if this is a read or write, it is a High severity issue in
the kernel.Product: AndroidVersions: Android SoCAndroid ID:

Reference: CISCO:20210224 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Unidirectional Link Detection Denial of Service and Arbitrary Code Execution Vulnerability
Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-udld-rce-xetH6w35

A vulnerability in the Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD) feature of
Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an
unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with
administrative privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition
on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input
validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending
crafted Cisco UDLD protocol packets to a directly connected, affected
device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary code with administrative privileges or cause the Cisco UDLD
process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected
device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition. Note: The UDLD
feature is disabled by default, and the conditions to exploit this
vulnerability are strict. The attacker needs full control of a
directly connected device. That device must be connected over a port
channel that has UDLD enabled. To trigger arbitrary code execution,
both the UDLD-enabled port channel and specific system conditions must
exist. In the absence of either the UDLD-enabled port channel or the
system conditions, attempts to exploit this vulnerability will result
in a DoS condition. It is possible, but highly unlikely, that an
attacker could control the necessary conditions for exploitation. The
CVSS score reflects this possibility. However, given the complexity of
exploitation, Cisco has assigned a Medium Security Impact Rating (SIR)
to this vulnerability.

Reference: URL:https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-n9kaci-queue-wedge-cLDDEfKF

A vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in
Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) Mode could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a queue wedge on a leaf
switch, which could result in critical control plane traffic to the
device being dropped. This could result in one or more leaf switches
being removed from the fabric. This vulnerability is due to
mishandling of ingress TCP traffic to a specific port. An attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by sending a stream of TCP packets to
a specific port on a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) configured on
the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a
specific packet queue to queue network buffers but never process them,
leading to an eventual queue wedge. This could cause control plane
traffic to be dropped, resulting in a denial of service (DoS)
condition where the leaf switches are unavailable. Note: This
vulnerability requires a manual intervention to power-cycle the device
to recover.
