Prior to versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the webpack-dev-middleware
development middleware for devpack does not validate the supplied URL
address sufficiently before returning the local file. It is possible
to access any file on the developer's machine. The middleware can
either work with the physical filesystem when reading the files or it
can use a virtualized in-memory `memfs` filesystem. If `writeToDisk`
configuration option is set to `true`, the physical filesystem is
used. The `getFilenameFromUrl` method is used to parse URL and build
the local file path. The public path prefix is stripped from the URL,
and the `unsecaped` path suffix is appended to the `outputPath`. As
the URL is not unescaped and normalized automatically before calling
the midlleware, it is possible to use `%2e` and `%2f` sequences to
perform path traversal attack. Developers using `webpack-dev-server`
or `webpack-dev-middleware` are affected by the issue. When the
project is started, an attacker might access any file on the
developer's machine and exfiltrate the content. If the development
server is listening on a public IP address (or `0.0.0.0`), an attacker
on the local network can access the local files without any
interaction from the victim (direct connection to the port). If the
server allows access from third-party domains, an attacker can send a
malicious link to the victim. When visited, the client side script can
connect to the local server and exfiltrate the local files. Starting
with fixed versions 7.1.0, 6.1.2, and 5.3.4, the URL is unescaped and
normalized before any further processing.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/freescout-helpdesk/freescout/security/advisories/GHSA-fffc-phh8-5h4v

FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. A Stored
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within
the Signature Input Field of the FreeScout Application prior to
version 1.8.128. Stored XSS occurs when user input is not properly
sanitized and is stored on the server, allowing an attacker to inject
malicious scripts that will be executed when other users access the
affected page. In this case, the Support Agent User can inject
malicious scripts into their signature, which will then be executed
when viewed by the Administrator. The application protects users
against XSS attacks by enforcing a CSP policy, the CSP Policy is:
`script-src 'self' 'nonce-abcd' `. The CSP policy only allows the
inclusion of JS files that are present on the application server and
doesn't allow any inline script or script other than nonce-abcd. The
CSP policy was bypassed by uploading a JS file to the server by a POST
request to /conversation/upload endpoint. After this, a working XSS
payload was crafted by including the uploaded JS file link as the src
of the script. This bypassed the CSP policy and XSS attacks became
possible. The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it allows an
attacker to compromise the FreeScout Application. By exploiting this
vulnerability, the attacker can perform various malicious actions such
as forcing the Administrator to execute actions without their
knowledge or consent. For instance, the attacker can force the
Administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker,
thereby giving the attacker full control over the application.
Alternatively, the attacker can elevate the privileges of a low-
privileged user to Administrator, further compromising the security of
the application. Attackers can steal sensitive information such as
login credentials, session tokens, personal identifiable information
(PII), and financial data. The vulnerability can also lead to
defacement of the Application. Version 1.8.128 contains a patch for
this issue.

FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions
prior to 1.8.128 are vulnerable to OS Command Injection in the
/public/tools.php source file. The value of the php_path parameter is
being executed as an OS command by the shell_exec function, without
validating it. This allows an adversary to execute malicious OS
commands on the server. A practical demonstration of the successful
command injection attack extracted the /etc/passwd file of the server.
This represented the complete compromise of the server hosting the
FreeScout application. This attack requires an attacker to know the
`App_Key` of the application. This limitation makes the Attack
Complexity to be High. If an attacker gets hold of the `App_Key`, the
attacker can compromise the Complete server on which the application
is deployed. Version 1.8.128 contains a patch for this issue.

Bref is an open-source project that helps users go serverless on
Amazon Web Services with PHP. When Bref prior to version 2.1.17 is
used with the Event-Driven Function runtime and the handler is a
`RequestHandlerInterface`, then the Lambda event is converted to a
PSR7 object. During the conversion process, if the request is a
MultiPart, each part is parsed. In the parsing process, the `Content-
Type` header of each part is read using the `Riverline/multipart-
parser` library. The library, in the
`StreamedPart::parseHeaderContent` function, performs slow multi-byte
string operations on the header value. Precisely, the
`mb_convert_encoding` function is used with the first (`$string`) and
third (`$from_encoding`) parameters read from the header value. An
attacker could send specifically crafted requests which would force
the server into performing long operations with a consequent long
billed duration. The attack has the following requirements and
limitations: The Lambda should use the Event-Driven Function runtime
and the `RequestHandlerInterface` handler and should implement at
least an endpoint accepting POST requests; the attacker can send
requests up to 6MB long (this is enough to cause a billed duration
between 400ms and 500ms with the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image of
Bref); and if the Lambda uses a PHP runtime <= php-82, the impact is
higher as the billed duration in the default 1024MB RAM Lambda image
of Bref could be brought to more than 900ms for each request. Notice
that the vulnerability applies only to headers read from the request
body as the request header has a limitation which allows a total
maximum size of ~10KB. Version 2.1.17 contains a fix for this issue.

WiX toolset lets developers create installers for Windows Installer,
the Windows installation engine. When a bundle runs as SYSTEM user,
Burn uses GetTempPathW which points to an insecure directory
C:\Windows\Temp to drop and load multiple binaries. Standard users can
hijack the binary before it's loaded in the application resulting in
elevation of privileges. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.14.1 and
4.0.5.

WiX toolset lets developers create installers for Windows Installer,
the Windows installation engine. The custom action behind WiX's
`RemoveFolderEx` functionality could allow a standard user to delete
protected directories. `RemoveFolderEx` deletes an entire directory
tree during installation or uninstallation. It does so by recursing
every subdirectory starting at a specified directory and adding each
subdirectory to the list of directories Windows Installer should
delete. If the setup author instructed `RemoveFolderEx` to delete a
per-user folder from a per-machine installer, an attacker could create
a directory junction in that per-user folder pointing to a per-
machine, protected directory. Windows Installer, when executing the
per-machine installer after approval by an administrator, would delete
the target of the directory junction. This vulnerability is fixed in
3.14.1 and 4.0.5.

Mobile Security Framework (MobSF) is a pen-testing, malware analysis
and security assessment framework capable of performing static and
dynamic analysis. In version 3.9.5 Beta and prior, MobSF does not
perform any input validation when extracting the hostnames in
`android:host`, so requests can also be sent to local hostnames. This
can lead to server-side request forgery. An attacker can cause the
server to make a connection to internal-only services within the
organization's infrastructure. Commit
5a8eeee73c5f504a6c3abdf2a139a13804efdb77 has a hotfix for this issue.

OneUptime is a solution for monitoring and managing online services.
The vulnerability lies in the improper validation of client-side
stored data within the web application. Specifically, the
is_master_admin key, stored in the local storage of the browser, can
be manipulated by an attacker. By changing this key from false to
true, the application grants administrative privileges to the user,
without proper server-side validation. This has been patched in
7.0.1815.

The azure-c-shared-utility is a C library for AMQP/MQTT communication
to Azure Cloud Services. This library may be used by the Azure IoT C
SDK for communication between IoT Hub and IoT Hub devices. An attacker
can cause an integer wraparound or under-allocation or heap buffer
overflow due to vulnerabilities in parameter checking mechanism, by
exploiting the buffer length parameter in Azure C SDK, which may lead
to remote code execution. Requirements for RCE are 1. Compromised
Azure account allowing malformed payloads to be sent to the device via
IoT Hub service, 2. By passing IoT hub service max message payload
limit of 128KB, and 3. Ability to overwrite code space with remote
