This disclosure regards a vulnerability related to UAA refresh tokens
and external identity providers.Assuming that an external identity
provider is linked to the UAA, a refresh token is issued to a client
on behalf of a user from that identity provider, the administrator of
the UAA deactivates the identity provider from the UAA. It is expected
that the UAA would reject a refresh token during a refresh token
grant, but it does not (hence the vulnerability). It will continue to
issue access tokens to request presenting such refresh tokens, as if
the identity provider was still active. As a result, clients with
refresh tokens issued through the deactivated identity provider would
still have access to Cloud Foundry resources until their refresh token
expires (which defaults to 30 days).

Code Dx versions prior to 2023.4.2 are vulnerable to user
impersonation attack where a malicious actor is able to gain access to
another user's account by crafting a custom "Remember Me" token. This
is possible due to the use of a hard-coded cipher which was used when
generating the token. A malicious actor who creates this token can
supply it to a separate Code Dx system, provided they know the
username they want to impersonate, and impersonate the user. Score 6.7

A vulnerability in class-of-service (CoS) queue management in Juniper
Networks Junos OS on the ACX2K Series devices allows an
unauthenticated network-based attacker to cause a Denial of Service
(DoS). Specific packets are being incorrectly routed to a queue used
for other high-priority traffic such as BGP, PIM, ICMP, ICMPV6 ND and
ISAKMP. Due to this misclassification of traffic, receipt of a high
rate of these specific packets will cause delays in the processing of
other traffic, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt
of this amount of traffic will create a sustained Denial of Service
(DoS) condition. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on ACX2K
Series: All versions prior to 19.4R3-S9; All 20.2 versions; 20.3
versions prior to 20.3R3-S6 on ACX2K Series; 20.4 versions prior to

An Uncontrolled Resource Consumption vulnerability in TCP processing
on the Routing Engine (RE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an
unauthenticated network-based attacker to send crafted TCP packets
destined to the device, resulting in an MBUF leak that ultimately
leads to a Denial of Service (DoS). The system does not recover

An Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling weakness in
the memory management of the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) on Juniper
Networks Junos OS Evolved PTX10003 Series devices allows an adjacently
located attacker who has established certain preconditions and
knowledge of the environment to send certain specific genuine packets
to begin a Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition attack
which will cause a memory leak to begin. Once this condition begins,
and as long as the attacker is able to sustain the offending traffic,
a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) event occurs. As a DDoS event,
the offending packets sent by the attacker will continue to flow from
one device to another as long as they are received and processed by
any devices, ultimately causing a cascading outage to any vulnerable
devices. Devices not vulnerable to the memory leak will process and
forward the offending packet(s) to neighboring devices. Due to
internal anti-flood security controls and mechanisms reaching their
maximum limit of response in the worst-case scenario, all affected
Junos OS Evolved devices will reboot in as little as 1.5 days. Reboots
to restore services cannot be avoided once the memory leak begins. The
device will self-recover after crashing and rebooting. Operator
intervention isn't required to restart the device. This issue affects:

An Improper Validation of Array Index vulnerability in the SIP ALG of
Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX 5000 Series allows a network-based,
unauthenticated attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When an
attacker sends an SIP packets with a malformed SDP field then the SIP
ALG can not process it which will lead to an FPC crash and restart.
Continued receipt of these specific packets will lead to a sustained
Denial of Service. This issue can only occur when both below mentioned
conditions are fulfilled: 1. Call distribution needs to be enabled:
[security alg sip enable-call-distribution] 2. The SIP ALG needs to be
enabled, either implicitly / by default or by way of configuration. To
confirm whether SIP ALG is enabled on SRX, and MX with SPC3 use the
following command: user@host> show security alg status | match sip SIP

An Unchecked Input for Loop Condition vulnerability in a NAT library
of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a local authenticated attacker
with low privileges to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When an
inconsistent "deterministic NAT" configuration is present on an SRX,
or MX with SPC3 and then a specific CLI command is issued the SPC will
crash and restart. Repeated execution of this command will lead to a
sustained DoS. Such a configuration is characterized by the total
number of port blocks being greater than the total number of hosts. An
example for such configuration is: [ services nat source pool TEST-
POOL address x.x.x.0/32 to x.x.x.15/32 ] [ services nat source pool
TEST-POOL port deterministic block-size 1008 ] [ services nat source
pool TEST-POOL port deterministic host address y.y.y.0/24] [ services
nat source pool TEST-POOL port deterministic include-boundary-
addresses] where according to the following calculation:
65536-1024=64512 (number of usable ports per IP address, implicit)
64512/1008=64 (number of port blocks per Nat IP) x.x.x.0/32 to
x.x.x.15/32 = 16 (NAT IP addresses available in NAT pool) total port
blocks in NAT Pool = 64 blocks per IP * 16 IPs = 1024 Port blocks host
address y.y.y.0/24 = 256 hosts (with include-boundary-addresses) If
the port block size is configured to be 4032, then the total port
blocks are (64512/4032) * 16 = 256 which is equivalent to the total
host addresses of 256, and the issue will not be seen. This issue

A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in
the Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series platforms with MPC10/MPC11
line cards, allows an unauthenticated adjacent attacker to cause a
Denial of Service (DoS). Devices are only vulnerable when the
Suspicious Control Flow Detection (scfd) feature is enabled. Upon
enabling this specific feature, an attacker sending specific traffic
is causing memory to be allocated dynamically and it is not freed.
Memory is not freed even after deactivating this feature. Sustained
processing of such traffic will eventually lead to an out of memory
condition that prevents all services from continuing to function, and
requires a manual restart to recover. The FPC memory usage can be
monitored using the CLI command "show chassis fpc". On running the
above command, the memory of AftDdosScfdFlow can be observed to detect
the memory leak. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX
Series: All versions prior to 20.2R3-S5; 20.3 version 20.3R1 and later

Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system. In version 11.6
and prior, when users register new accounts and/or change passwords,
there is no validation in place which would prevent them from picking
an easy to guess password. This issue is resolved by providing
defaults for the `AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS` configuration setting. As
of version 11.7, the password can&#8217;t be too similar to other personal
information, must contain at least 10 characters, can&#8217;t be a commonly
used password, and can&#8217;t be entirely numeric. As a workaround, an
administrator may reset all passwords in Kiwi TCMS if they think a
weak password may have been chosen.

kenny2automate is a Discord bot. In the web interface for server
settings, form elements were generated with Discord channel IDs as
part of input names. Prior to commit a947d7c, no validation was
performed to ensure that the channel IDs submitted actually belonged
to the server being configured. Thus anyone who has access to the
channel ID they wish to change settings for and the server settings
panel for any server could change settings for the requested channel
no matter which server it belonged to. Commit a947d7c resolves the
issue and has been deployed to the official instance of the bot. The
only workaround that exists is to disable the web config entirely by
changing it to run on localhost. Note that a workaround is only
necessary for those who run their own instance of the bot.

ViewVC, a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control
repositories, as a cross-site scripting vulnerability that affects
versions prior to 1.2.2 and 1.1.29. The impact of this vulnerability
is mitigated by the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to
a Subversion repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC
instance. The attack vector involves files with unsafe names (names
that, when embedded into an HTML stream, would cause the browser to
run unwanted code), which themselves can be challenging to create.
Users should update to at least version 1.2.2 (if they are using a
1.2.x version of ViewVC) or 1.1.29 (if they are using a 1.1.x
version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no longer supported, so users of that
release lineage should implement a workaround. Users can edit their
ViewVC EZT view templates to manually HTML-escape changed paths during
rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file
references to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format
"html"]` and `[end]`. For most users, that means that references to
`[changes.path]` will become `[format "html"][changes.path][end]`.
(This workaround should be reverted after upgrading to a patched
version of ViewVC, else changed path names will be doubly escaped.)

CKEditor Integration UI adds support for editing wiki pages using
CKEditor. Prior to versions 1.64.3,t he `CKEditor.HTMLConverter`
document lacked a protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery
(CSRF), allowing to execute macros with the rights of the current
user. If a privileged user with programming rights was tricked into
executing a GET request to this document with certain parameters
(e.g., via an image with a corresponding URL embedded in a comment or
via a redirect), this would allow arbitrary remote code execution and
the attacker could gain rights, access private information or impact
the availability of the wiki. The issue has been patched in the
CKEditor Integration version 1.64.3. This has also been patched in the
version of the CKEditor integration that is bundled starting with
XWiki 14.6 RC1. There are no known workarounds for this other than
upgrading the CKEditor integration to a fixed version.

go-ipld-prime is an implementation of the InterPlanetary Linked Data
(IPLD) spec interfaces, a batteries-included codec implementations of
IPLD for CBOR and JSON, and tooling for basic operations on IPLD
objects. Encoding data which contains a Bytes kind Node will pass a
Bytes token to the JSON encoder which will panic as it doesn't expect
to receive Bytes tokens. Such an encode should be treated as an error,
as plain JSON should not be able to encode Bytes. This only impacts
uses of the `json` codec. `dag-json` is not impacted. Use of `json` as
a decoder is not impacted. This issue is fixed in v0.19.0. As a
workaround, one may prefer the `dag-json` codec, which has the ability
to encode bytes.

The `sanitize-svg` package, a small SVG sanitizer to prevent cross-
site scripting attacks, uses a deny-list-pattern to sanitize SVGs to
prevent XSS. In doing so, literal `<script>`-tags and on-event
handlers were detected in versions prior to 0.4.0. As a result,
downstream software that relies on `sanitize-svg` and expects
resulting SVGs to be safe, may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting.
This vulnerability was addressed in v0.4.0. There are no known
workarounds

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
On 2023-01-01 during an internal audit of Grafana, a member of the
security team found a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core
plugin "Text". The stored XSS vulnerability requires several user
interactions in order to be fully exploited. The vulnerability was
possible due to React's render cycle that will pass though the
unsanitized HTML code, but in the next cycle the HTML is cleaned up
and saved in Grafana's database. An attacker needs to have the Editor
role in order to change a Text panel to include JavaScript. Another
user needs to edit the same Text panel, and click on "Markdown" or
"HTML" for the code to be executed. This means that vertical privilege
escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a
known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin
role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. This issue has
been patched in versions 9.2.10 and 9.3.4.

KubePi is a k8s panel. The jwt authentication function of KubePi
through version 1.6.2 uses hard-coded Jwtsigkeys, resulting in the
same Jwtsigkeys for all online projects. This means that an attacker
can forge any jwt token to take over the administrator account of any
online project. Furthermore, they may use the administrator to take
over the k8s cluster of the target enterprise. `session.go`, the use
of hard-coded JwtSigKey, allows an attacker to use this value to forge
jwt tokens arbitrarily. The JwtSigKey is confidential and should not
be hard-coded in the code. The vulnerability has been fixed in 1.6.3.
In the patch, JWT key is specified in app.yml. If the user leaves it
blank, a random key will be used. There are no workarounds aside from
upgrading.

ViewVC is a browser interface for CVS and Subversion version control
repositories. Versions prior to 1.2.3 and 1.1.30 are vulnerable to
cross-site scripting. The impact of this vulnerability is mitigated by
the need for an attacker to have commit privileges to a Subversion
repository exposed by an otherwise trusted ViewVC instance. The attack
vector involves files with unsafe names (names that, when embedded
into an HTML stream, would cause the browser to run unwanted code),
which themselves can be challenging to create. Users should update to
at least version 1.2.3 (if they are using a 1.2.x version of ViewVC)
or 1.1.30 (if they are using a 1.1.x version). ViewVC 1.0.x is no
longer supported, so users of that release lineage should implement
one of the following workarounds. Users can edit their ViewVC EZT view
templates to manually HTML-escape changed path "copyfrom paths" during
rendering. Locate in your template set's `revision.ezt` file
references to those changed paths, and wrap them with `[format
"html"]` and `[end]`. For most users, that means that references to
`[changes.copy_path]` will become `[format
"html"][changes.copy_path][end]`. (This workaround should be reverted
after upgrading to a patched version of ViewVC, else "copyfrom path"
names will be doubly escaped.)

Tokio is a runtime for writing applications with Rust. Starting with
version 1.7.0 and prior to versions 1.18.4, 1.20.3, and 1.23.1, when
configuring a Windows named pipe server, setting `pipe_mode` will
reset `reject_remote_clients` to `false`. If the application has
previously configured `reject_remote_clients` to `true`, this
effectively undoes the configuration. Remote clients may only access
the named pipe if the named pipe's associated path is accessible via a
publicly shared folder (SMB). Versions 1.23.1, 1.20.3, and 1.18.4 have
been patched. The fix will also be present in all releases starting
from version 1.24.0. Named pipes were introduced to Tokio in version
1.7.0, so releases older than 1.7.0 are not affected. As a workaround,
ensure that `pipe_mode` is set first after initializing a
`ServerOptions`.

Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any
infrastructure that can run Node.js. Parse Server uses the request
header `x-forwarded-for` to determine the client IP address. If Parse
Server doesn't run behind a proxy server, then a client can set this
header and Parse Server will trust the value of the header. The
incorrect client IP address will be used by various features in Parse
Server. This allows to circumvent the security mechanism of the Parse
Server option `masterKeyIps` by setting an allowed IP address as the
`x-forwarded-for` header value. This issue has been patched in version
5.4.1. The mechanism to determine the client IP address has been
rewritten. The correct IP address determination now requires to set
the Parse Server option `trustProxy`.

Canarytokens is an open source tool which helps track activity and
actions on your network. A Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability was
identified in the history page of triggered Canarytokens prior to sha-
fb61290. An attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken (a URL)
can use this to execute Javascript in the Canarytoken's trigger
history page (domain: canarytokens.org) when the history page is later
visited by the Canarytoken's creator. This vulnerability could be used
to disable or delete the affected Canarytoken, or view its activation
history. It might also be used as a stepping stone towards revealing
more information about the Canarytoken's creator to the attacker. For
example, an attacker could recover the email address tied to the
Canarytoken, or place Javascript on the history page that redirect the
creator towards an attacker-controlled Canarytoken to show the
creator's network location. This vulnerability is similar to
CVE-2022-31113, but affected parameters reported differently from the
Canarytoken trigger request. An attacker could only act on the
discovered Canarytoken. This issue did not expose other Canarytokens
or other Canarytoken creators. Canarytokens Docker images sha-fb61290
and later contain a patch for this issue.

FreshRSS is a self-hosted RSS feed aggregator. When using the greader
API, the provided password is logged in clear in `users/_/log_api.txt`
in the case where the authentication fails. The issues occurs in
`authorizationToUser()` in `greader.php`. If there is an issue with
the request or the credentials, `unauthorized()` or `badRequest()` is
called. Both these functions are printing the return of `debugInfo()`
in the logs. `debugInfo()` will return the content of the request. By
default, this will be saved in `users/_/log_api.txt` and if the const
`COPY_LOG_TO_SYSLOG` is true, in syslogs as well. Exploiting this
issue requires having access to logs produced by FreshRSS. Using the
information from the logs, a malicious individual could get users' API
keys (would be displayed if the users fills in a bad username) or
passwords.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. Versions of Argo CD starting with v1.8.2 and prior to
2.3.13, 2.4.19, 2.5.6, and 2.6.0-rc-3 are vulnerable to an improper
authorization bug causing the API to accept certain invalid tokens.
OIDC providers include an `aud` (audience) claim in signed tokens. The
value of that claim specifies the intended audience(s) of the token
(i.e. the service or services which are meant to accept the token).
Argo CD _does_ validate that the token was signed by Argo CD's
configured OIDC provider. But Argo CD _does not_ validate the audience
claim, so it will accept tokens that are not intended for Argo CD. If
Argo CD's configured OIDC provider also serves other audiences (for
example, a file storage service), then Argo CD will accept a token
intended for one of those other audiences. Argo CD will grant the user
privileges based on the token's `groups` claim, even though those
groups were not intended to be used by Argo CD. This bug also
increases the impact of a stolen token. If an attacker steals a valid
token for a different audience, they can use it to access Argo CD. A
patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.6.0-rc3,
2.5.6, 2.4.19, and 2.3.13. There are no workarounds.

Flarum is a forum software for building communities. Using the
mentions feature provided by the flarum/mentions extension, users can
mention any post ID on the forum with the special
`@"<username>"#p<id>` syntax. The following behavior never changes no
matter if the actor should be able to read the mentioned post or not:
A URL to the mentioned post is inserted into the actor post HTML,
leaking its discussion ID and post number. The `mentionsPosts`
relationship included in the `POST /api/posts` and `PATCH
/api/posts/<id>` JSON responses leaks the full JSON:API payload of all
mentioned posts without any access control. This includes the content,
date, number and attributes added by other extensions. An attacker
only needs the ability to create new posts on the forum to exploit the
vulnerability. This works even if new posts require approval. If they
have the ability to edit posts, the attack can be performed even more
discreetly by using a single post to scan any size of database and
hiding the attack post content afterward. The attack allows the
leaking of all posts in the forum database, including posts awaiting
approval, posts in tags the user has no access to, and private
discussions created by other extensions like FriendsOfFlarum Byobu.
This also includes non-comment posts like tag changes or renaming
events. The discussion payload is not leaked but using the mention
HTML payload it's possible to extract the discussion ID of all posts
and combine all posts back together into their original discussions
even if the discussion title remains unknown. All Flarum versions
prior to 1.6.3 are affected. The vulnerability has been fixed and
published as flarum/core v1.6.3. As a workaround, user can disable the
mentions extension.

Flarum is a forum software for building communities. Using the
notifications feature, one can read restricted/private content and
bypass access checks that would be in place for such content. The
notification-sending component does not check that the subject of the
notification can be seen by the receiver, and proceeds to send
notifications through their different channels. The alerts do not leak
data despite this as they are listed based on a visibility check,
however, emails are still sent out. This means that, for extensions
which restrict access to posts, any actor can bypass the restriction
by subscribing to the discussion if the Subscriptions extension is
enabled. The attack allows the leaking of some posts in the forum
database, including posts awaiting approval, posts in tags the user
has no access to if they could subscribe to a discussion before it
becomes private, and posts restricted by third-party extensions. All
Flarum versions prior to v1.6.3 are affected. The vulnerability has
been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.6.3. All communities
running Flarum should upgrade as soon as possible to v1.6.3. As a
workaround, disable the Flarum Subscriptions extension or disable
email notifications altogether. There are no other supported
workarounds for this issue for Flarum versions below 1.6.3.

Flarum is a discussion platform for websites. If the first post of a
discussion is permanently deleted but the discussion stays visible,
any actor who can view the discussion is able to create a new reply
via the REST API, no matter the reply permission or lock status. This
includes users that don't have a validated email. Guests cannot
successfully create a reply because the API will fail with a 500 error
when the user ID 0 is inserted into the database. This happens because
when the first post of a discussion is permanently deleted, the
`first_post_id` attribute of the discussion becomes `null` which
causes access control to be skipped for all new replies. Flarum
automatically makes discussions with zero comments invisible so an
additional condition for this vulnerability is that the discussion
must have at least one approved reply so that
`discussions.comment_count` is still above zero after the post
deletion. This can open the discussion to uncontrolled spam or just
unintentional replies if users still had their tab open before the
vulnerable discussion was locked and then post a reply when they
shouldn't be able to. In combination with the email notification
settings, this could also be used as a way to send unsolicited emails.
Versions between `v1.3.0` and `v1.6.3` are impacted. The vulnerability
has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.6.3. All communities
running Flarum should upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known
workarounds.

The wpForo Forum plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File
Include, Server-Side Request Forgery, and PHAR Deserialization in
versions up to, and including, 2.1.7. This is due to the insecure use
of file_get_contents without appropriate verification of the data
being supplied to the function. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as a
subscriber, to retrieve the contents of files like wp-config.php
hosted on the system, perform a deserialization attack and possibly
achieve remote code execution, and make requests to internal services.

Git is a revision control system. Using a specially-crafted
repository, Git prior to versions 2.39.2, 2.38.4, 2.37.6, 2.36.5,
2.35.7, 2.34.7, 2.33.7, 2.32.6, 2.31.7, and 2.30.8 can be tricked into
using its local clone optimization even when using a non-local
transport. Though Git will abort local clones whose source
`$GIT_DIR/objects` directory contains symbolic links, the `objects`
directory itself may still be a symbolic link. These two may be
combined to include arbitrary files based on known paths on the
victim's filesystem within the malicious repository's working copy,
allowing for data exfiltration in a similar manner as CVE-2022-39253.
A fix has been prepared and will appear in v2.39.2 v2.38.4 v2.37.6
v2.36.5 v2.35.7 v2.34.7 v2.33.7 v2.32.6, v2.31.7 and v2.30.8. If
upgrading is impractical, two short-term workarounds are available.
Avoid cloning repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-
submodules`. Instead, consider cloning repositories without
recursively cloning their submodules, and instead run `git submodule
update` at each layer. Before doing so, inspect each new `.gitmodules`
file to ensure that it does not contain suspicious module URLs.

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps
developers build websites and apps. The gatsby-transformer-remark
plugin prior to versions 5.25.1 and 6.3.2 passes input through to the
`gray-matter` npm package, which is vulnerable to JavaScript injection
in its default configuration, unless input is sanitized. The
vulnerability is present in gatsby-transformer-remark when passing
input in data mode (querying MarkdownRemark nodes via GraphQL).
Injected JavaScript executes in the context of the build server. To
exploit this vulnerability untrusted/unsanitized input would need to
be sourced by or added into a file processed by gatsby-transformer-
remark. A patch has been introduced in `gatsby-transformer-
remark@5.25.1` and `gatsby-transformer-remark@6.3.2` which mitigates
the issue by disabling the `gray-matter` JavaScript Frontmatter
engine. As a workaround, if an older version of `gatsby-transformer-
remark` must be used, input passed into the plugin should be sanitized
ahead of processing. It is encouraged for projects to upgrade to the
latest major release branch for all Gatsby plugins to ensure the
latest security updates and bug fixes are received in a timely manner.

ZITADEL is a combination of Auth0 and Keycloak. RefreshTokens is an
OAuth 2.0 feature that allows applications to retrieve new access
tokens and refresh the user's session without the need for interacting
with a UI. RefreshTokens were not invalidated when a user was locked
or deactivated. The deactivated or locked user was able to obtain a
valid access token only through a refresh token grant. When the locked
or deactivated user&#8217;s session was already terminated (&#8220;logged out&#8221;)
then it was not possible to create a new session. Renewal of access
token through a refresh token grant is limited to the configured
amount of time (RefreshTokenExpiration). As a workaround, ensure the
RefreshTokenExpiration in the OIDC settings of your instance is set

Netdata is an open source option for real-time infrastructure
monitoring and troubleshooting. An attacker with the ability to
establish a streaming connection can execute arbitrary commands on the
targeted Netdata agent. When an alert is triggered, the function
`health_alarm_execute` is called. This function performs different
checks and then enqueues a command by calling `spawn_enq_cmd`. This
command is populated with several arguments that are not sanitized.
One of them is the `registry_hostname` of the node for which the alert
is raised. By providing a specially crafted `registry_hostname` as
part of the health data that is streamed to a Netdata (parent) agent,
an attacker can execute arbitrary commands at the remote host as a
side-effect of the raised alert. Note that the commands are executed
as the user running the Netdata Agent. This user is usually named
`netdata`. The ability to run arbitrary commands may allow an attacker
to escalate privileges by escalating other vulnerabilities in the
system, as that user. The problem has been fixed in: Netdata agent
v1.37 (stable) and Netdata agent v1.36.0-409 (nightly). As a
workaround, streaming is not enabled by default. If you have
previously enabled this, it can be disabled. Limiting access to the
port on the recipient Agent to trusted child connections may mitigate
the impact of this vulnerability.

Netdata is an open source option for real-time infrastructure
monitoring and troubleshooting. Each Netdata Agent has an
automatically generated MACHINE GUID. It is generated when the agent
first starts and it is saved to disk, so that it will persist across
restarts and reboots. Anyone who has access to a Netdata Agent has
access to its MACHINE_GUID. Streaming is a feature that allows a
Netdata Agent to act as parent for other Netdata Agents (children),
offloading children from various functions (increased data retention,
ML, health monitoring, etc) that can now be handled by the parent
Agent. Configuration is done via `stream.conf`. On the parent side,
users configure in `stream.conf` an API key (any random UUID can do)
to provide common configuration for all children using this API key
and per MACHINE GUID configuration to customize the configuration for
each child. The way this was implemented, allowed an attacker to use a
valid MACHINE_GUID as an API key. This affects all users who expose
their Netdata Agents (children) to non-trusted users and they also
expose to the same users Netdata Agent parents that aggregate data
from all these children. The problem has been fixed in: Netdata agent
v1.37 (stable) and Netdata agent v1.36.0-409 (nightly). As a
workaround, do not enable streaming by default. If you have previously
enabled this, it can be disabled. Limiting access to the port on the

Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses V8 and is
built in Rust. Multi-threaded programs were able to spoof interactive
permission prompt by rewriting the prompt to suggest that program is
waiting on user confirmation to unrelated action. A malicious program
could clear the terminal screen after permission prompt was shown and
write a generic message. This situation impacts users who use Web
Worker API and relied on interactive permission prompt. The
reproduction is very timing sensitive and can&#8217;t be reliably reproduced
on every try. This problem can not be exploited on systems that do not
attach an interactive prompt (for example headless servers). The
problem has been fixed in Deno v1.29.3; it is recommended all users
update to this version. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
upgrade may run with --no-prompt flag to disable interactive
permission prompts.

A flaw was found in the Open Cluster Management (OCM) when a user have
access to the worker nodes which has the cluster-manager-registration-
controller or cluster-manager deployments. A malicious user can take
advantage of this and bind the cluster-admin to any service account or
using the service account to list all secrets for all kubernetes
namespaces, leading into a cluster-level privilege escalation.

GLPI is a Free Asset and IT Management Software package. Versions
10.0.0 and above, prior to 10.0.6 are vulnerable to Incorrect
Authorization. This vulnerability allow unauthorized access to
inventory files. Thus, if anonymous access to FAQ is allowed,
inventory files are accessbile by unauthenticated users. This issue is
patched in version 10.0.6. As a workaround, disable native inventory
and delete inventory files from server (default location is
`files/_inventory`).

An authentication vulnerability was discovered in Jira Service
Management Server and Data Center which allows an attacker to
impersonate another user and gain access to a Jira Service Management
instance under certain circumstances_._ With write access to a User
Directory and outgoing email enabled on a Jira Service Management
instance, an attacker could gain access to signup tokens sent to users
with accounts that have never been logged into. Access to these tokens
can be obtained in two cases: * If the attacker is included on Jira
issues or requests with these users, or * If the attacker is forwarded
or otherwise gains access to emails containing a &#8220;View Request&#8221; link
from these users. Bot accounts are particularly susceptible to this
scenario. On instances with single sign-on, external customer accounts
can be affected in projects where anyone can create their own account.

Improper access control in editor components of The Document
Foundation LibreOffice allowed an attacker to craft a document that
would cause external links to be loaded without prompt. In the
affected versions of LibreOffice documents that used "floating frames"
linked to external files, would load the contents of those frames
without prompting the user for permission to do so. This was
inconsistent with the treatment of other linked content in
LibreOffice. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice
7.4 versions prior to 7.4.7; 7.5 versions prior to 7.5.3.

A Improper Privilege Management vulnerability in SUSE Rancher causes
permission changes in Azure AD not to be reflected to users while they
are logged in the Rancher UI. This would cause the users to retain
their previous permissions in Rancher, even if they change groups on

from a group, thus retaining their access to Rancher instead of losing
it. This issue affects Rancher: from >= 2.6.7 before < 2.6.13, from >=

act is a project which allows for local running of github actions. The
artifact server that stores artifacts from Github Action runs does not
sanitize path inputs. This allows an attacker to download and
overwrite arbitrary files on the host from a Github Action. This issue
may lead to privilege escalation. The /upload endpoint is vulnerable
to path traversal as filepath is user controlled, and ultimately flows
into os.Mkdir and os.Open. The /artifact endpoint is vulnerable to
path traversal as the path is variable is user controlled, and the
specified file is ultimately returned by the server. This has been
addressed in version 0.2.40. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
unable to upgrade may, during implementation of Open and OpenAtEnd for
FS, ensure to use ValidPath() to check against path traversal or clean
the user-provided paths manually.

Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. In versions of zulip
prior to commit `2f6c5a8` but after commit `04cf68b` users could
upload files with arbitrary `Content-Type` which would be served from
the Zulip hostname with `Content-Disposition: inline` and no `Content-
Security-Policy` header, allowing them to trick other users into
executing arbitrary Javascript in the context of the Zulip
application. Among other things, this enables session theft. Only
deployments which use the S3 storage (not the local-disk storage) are
affected, and only deployments which deployed commit
04cf68b45ebb5c03247a0d6453e35ffc175d55da, which has only been in
`main`, not any numbered release. Users affected should upgrade from
main again to deploy this fix. Switching from S3 storage to the local-
disk storage would nominally mitigate this, but is likely more
involved than upgrading to the latest `main` which addresses the
issue.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. Versions starting with 2.5.0-rc1 and above, prior to
2.5.8, and version 2.6.0-rc4, are vulnerable to an authorization
bypass bug which allows a malicious Argo CD user to deploy
Applications outside the configured allowed namespaces. Reconciled
Application namespaces are specified as a comma-delimited list of glob
patterns. When sharding is enabled on the Application controller, it
does not enforce that list of patterns when reconciling Applications.
For example, if Application namespaces are configured to be argocd-*,
the Application controller may reconcile an Application installed in a
namespace called other, even though it does not start with argocd-.
Reconciliation of the out-of-bounds Application is only triggered when
the Application is updated, so the attacker must be able to cause an
update operation on the Application resource. This bug only applies to
users who have explicitly enabled the "apps-in-any-namespace" feature
by setting `application.namespaces` in the argocd-cmd-params-cm
ConfigMap or otherwise setting the `--application-namespaces` flags on
the Application controller and API server components. The apps-in-any-
namespace feature is in beta as of this Security Advisory's publish
date. The bug is also limited to Argo CD instances where sharding is
enabled by increasing the `replicas` count for the Application
controller. Finally, the AppProjects' `sourceNamespaces` field acts as
a secondary check against this exploit. To cause reconciliation of an
Application in an out-of-bounds namespace, an AppProject must be
available which permits Applications in the out-of-bounds namespace. A
patch for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.5.8 and
2.6.0-rc5. As a workaround, running only one replica of the
Application controller will prevent exploitation of this bug. Making
sure all AppProjects' sourceNamespaces are restricted within the
confines of the configured Application namespaces will also prevent
exploitation of this bug.

Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant with the
IETF RFC3261 specification. In affected versions Sofia-SIP **lacks
both message length and attributes length checks** when it handles
STUN packets, leading to controllable heap-over-flow. For example, in
stun_parse_attribute(), after we get the attribute's type and length
value, the length will be used directly to copy from the heap,
regardless of the message's left size. Since network users control the
overflowed length, and the data is written to heap chunks later,
attackers may achieve remote code execution by heap grooming or other
exploitation methods. The bug was introduced 16 years ago in sofia-sip
1.12.4 (plus some patches through 12/21/2006) to in tree libs with
git-svn-id: http://svn.freeswitch.org/svn/freeswitch/trunk@3774
d0543943-73ff-0310-b7d9-9358b9ac24b2. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/06/5

libgit2 is a cross-platform, linkable library implementation of Git.
When using an SSH remote with the optional libssh2 backend, libgit2
does not perform certificate checking by default. Prior versions of
libgit2 require the caller to set the `certificate_check` field of
libgit2's `git_remote_callbacks` structure - if a certificate check
callback is not set, libgit2 does not perform any certificate
checking. This means that by default - without configuring a
certificate check callback, clients will not perform validation on the
server SSH keys and may be subject to a man-in-the-middle attack.
Users are encouraged to upgrade to v1.4.5 or v1.5.1. Users unable to
upgrade should ensure that all relevant certificates are manually
checked.

Git for Windows is the Windows port of the revision control system
Git. Prior to Git for Windows version 2.39.2, by carefully crafting
DLL and putting into a subdirectory of a specific name living next to
the Git for Windows installer, Windows can be tricked into side-
loading said DLL. This potentially allows users with local write
access to place malicious payloads in a location where automated
upgrades might run the Git for Windows installer with elevation.
Version 2.39.2 contains a patch for this issue. Some workarounds are
available. Never leave untrusted files in the Downloads folder or its
sub-folders before executing the Git for Windows installer, or move
the installer into a different directory before executing it.

tpm2-tss is an open source software implementation of the Trusted
Computing Group (TCG) Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2 Software Stack
(TSS2). In affected versions `Tss2_RC_SetHandler` and `Tss2_RC_Decode`
both index into `layer_handler` with an 8 bit layer number, but the
array only has `TPM2_ERROR_TSS2_RC_LAYER_COUNT` entries, so trying to
add a handler for higher-numbered layers or decode a response code
with such a layer number reads/writes past the end of the buffer. This
Buffer overrun, could result in arbitrary code execution. An example
attack would be a MiTM bus attack that returns 0xFFFFFFFF for the RC.
Given the common use case of TPM modules an attacker must have local
access to the target machine with local system privileges which allows
access to the TPM system. Usually TPM access requires administrative
privilege.

CKAN is an open-source DMS (data management system) for powering data
hubs and data portals. When creating a new container based on one of
the Docker images listed below, the same secret key was being used by
default. If the users didn't set a custom value via environment
variables in the `.env` file, that key was shared across different
CKAN instances, making it easy to forge authentication requests. Users
overriding the default secret key in their own `.env` file are not
affected by this issue. Note that the legacy images (ckan/ckan)
located in the main CKAN repo are not affected by this issue. The
affected images are ckan/ckan-docker, (ckan/ckan-base images),
okfn/docker-ckan (openknowledge/ckan-base and openknowledge/ckan-dev
images) keitaroinc/docker-ckan (keitaro/ckan images).

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/01/19/1

In Sudo before 1.9.12p2, the sudoedit (aka -e) feature mishandles
extra arguments passed in the user-provided environment variables
(SUDO_EDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR), allowing a local attacker to append
arbitrary entries to the list of files to process. This can lead to
privilege escalation. Affected versions are 1.8.0 through 1.9.12.p1.
The problem exists because a user-specified editor may contain a "--"
argument that defeats a protection mechanism, e.g., an EDITOR='vim --
/path/to/extra/file' value.

A vulnerability was found in libssh, where the authentication check of
the connecting client can be bypassed in
the`pki_verify_data_signature` function in memory allocation problems.
This issue may happen if there is insufficient memory or the memory
usage is limited. The problem is caused by the return value `rc,`
which is initialized to SSH_ERROR and later rewritten to save the
return value of the function call `pki_key_check_hash_compatible.` The
value of the variable is not changed between this point and the
cryptographic verification. Therefore any error between them calls
`goto error` returning SSH_OK.

Strapi through 4.5.5 does not verify the access or ID tokens issued
during the OAuth flow when the AWS Cognito login provider is used for
authentication. A remote attacker could forge an ID token that is
signed using the 'None' type algorithm to bypass authentication and
impersonate any user that use AWS Cognito for authentication.

Strapi through 4.5.5 allows attackers (with access to the admin panel)
to discover sensitive user details by exploiting the query filter. The
attacker can filter users by columns that contain sensitive
information and infer a value from API responses. If the attacker has
super admin access, then this can be exploited to discover the
password hash and password reset token of all users. If the attacker
has admin panel access to an account with permission to access the
username and email of API users with a lower privileged role (e.g.,
Editor or Author), then this can be exploited to discover sensitive
information for all API users but not other admin accounts.
