The Signal app before 5.34 for iOS allows URI spoofing via RTLO
injection. It incorrectly renders RTLO encoded URLs beginning with a
non-breaking space, when there is a hash character in the URL. This
technique allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to send legitimate
looking links, appearing to be any website URL, by abusing the non-
http/non-https automatic rendering of URLs. An attacker can spoof, for
example, example.com, and masquerade any URL with a malicious
destination. An attacker requires a subdomain such as gepj, txt, fdp,
or xcod, which would appear backwards as jpeg, txt, pdf, and docx
respectively.

An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31.
Due to the use of an insecure encryption AES mode (Electronic
Codebook, aka ECB), an attacker may be able to extract information
even from encrypted data, for example by observing repeating byte
patterns. The firmware of the USB-to-SATA bridge controller
INIC-3637EN uses AES-256 with the ECB mode. This operation mode of
block ciphers (e.g., AES) always encrypts identical plaintext data, in
this case blocks of 16 bytes, to identical ciphertext data. For some
data, for instance bitmap images, the lack of the cryptographic
property called diffusion, within ECB, can leak sensitive information
even in encrypted data. Thus, the use of the ECB operation mode can
put the confidentiality of specific information at risk, even in an
encrypted form. This affects Keypad Secure USB 3.2 Gen 1 Drive Part

An issue was discovered in certain Verbatim drives through 2022-03-31.
Due to missing integrity checks, an attacker can manipulate the
content of the emulated CD-ROM drive (containing the Windows and macOS
client software). The content of this emulated CD-ROM drive is stored
as an ISO-9660 image in the hidden sectors of the USB drive, that can
only be accessed using special IOCTL commands, or when installing the
drive in an external disk enclosure. By manipulating this ISO-9660
image or replacing it with another one, an attacker is able to store
malicious software on the emulated CD-ROM drive. This software may get
executed by an unsuspecting victim when using the device. For example,
an attacker with temporary physical access during the supply chain
could program a modified ISO-9660 image on a device that always
accepts an attacker-controlled password for unlocking the device. If
the attacker later on gains access to the used USB drive, he can
simply decrypt all contained user data. Storing arbitrary other
malicious software is also possible. This affects Executive

sanitizes the query parameters in the forwarded query when the
outbound request's Form field is set after the ReverseProxy. Director

parameters. Proxies which do not parse query parameters continue to
forward the original query parameters unchanged.

Reference: MISC:https://www.zenity.io/blog/zapescape-organization-wide-control-over-code-by-zapier/
Reference: MISC:https://www.zenity.io/blog/zapescape-vulnerability-disclosure/

Code by Zapier before 2022-08-17 allowed intra-account privilege
escalation that included execution of Python or JavaScript code. In
other words, Code by Zapier was providing a customer-controlled
general-purpose virtual machine that unintentionally granted full
access to all users of a company's account, but was supposed to
enforce role-based access control within that company's account.
Before 2022-08-17, a customer could have resolved this by (in effect)
using a separate virtual machine for an application that held
credentials - or other secrets - that weren't supposed to be shared
among all of its employees. (Multiple accounts would have been needed
to operate these independent virtual machines.)

FjGabiFlashCoreAbstractionSmm driver registers a Software System
Management Interrupt (SWSMI) handler that is not sufficiently
validated to ensure that the CommBuffer (or any other communication
buffer's nested contents) are not pointing to SMRAM contents. A
potential attacker can therefore write fixed data to SMRAM, which
could lead to data corruption inside this memory (e.g., change the SMI
handler's code or modify SMRAM map structures to break input pointer
validation for other SMI handlers). Thus, the attacker could elevate
privileges from ring 0 to ring -2 and execute arbitrary code in SMM.

An issue was discovered in rsync before 3.2.5 that allows malicious
remote servers to write arbitrary files inside the directories of
connecting peers. The server chooses which files/directories are sent
to the client. However, the rsync client performs insufficient
validation of file names. A malicious rsync server (or Man-in-The-

target directory and subdirectories (for example, overwrite the
.ssh/authorized_keys file).

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. The XWiki Crypto API will
generate X509 certificates signed by default using SHA1 with RSA,
which is not considered safe anymore for use in certificate
signatures, due to the risk of collisions with SHA1. The problem has
been patched in XWiki version 13.10.6, 14.3.1 and 14.4-rc-1. Since
then, the Crypto API will generate X509 certificates signed by default
using SHA256 with RSA. Administrators are advised to upgrade their
XWiki installation to one of the patched versions. If the upgrade is
not possible, it is possible to patch the module xwiki-platform-crypto
in a local installation by applying the change exposed in 26728f3 and
re-compiling the module.

runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux
according to the OCI specification. A bug was found in runc prior to
version 1.1.2 where `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty
inheritable Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux
environment and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities
to elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during execve(2).
This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the
inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included
in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in runc
1.1.2. This fix changes `runc exec --cap` behavior such that the
additional capabilities granted to the process being executed (as
specified via `--cap` arguments) do not include inheritable
capabilities. In addition, `runc spec` is changed to not set any
inheritable capabilities in the created example OCI spec
(`config.json`) file.

Argo Workflows is an open source container-native workflow engine for
orchestrating parallel jobs on Kubernetes. In affected versions an
attacker can create a workflow which produces a HTML artifact
containing an HTML file that contains a script which uses XHR calls to
interact with the Argo Server API. The attacker emails the deep-link
to the artifact to their victim. The victim opens the link, the script
starts running. As the script has access to the Argo Server API (as
the victim), so may read information about the victim&#8217;s workflows, or
create and delete workflows. Note the attacker must be an insider:
they must have access to the same cluster as the victim and must
already be able to run their own workflows. The attacker must have an
understanding of the victim&#8217;s system. We have seen no evidence of this
in the wild. We urge all users to upgrade to the fixed versions.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. A critical vulnerability has been discovered in Argo CD
starting with version 1.4.0 and prior to versions 2.1.15, 2.2.9, and
2.3.4 which would allow unauthenticated users to impersonate as any
Argo CD user or role, including the `admin` user, by sending a
specifically crafted JSON Web Token (JWT) along with the request. In
order for this vulnerability to be exploited, anonymous access to the
Argo CD instance must have been enabled. In a default Argo CD
installation, anonymous access is disabled. The vulnerability can be
exploited to impersonate as any user or role, including the built-in
`admin` account regardless of whether it is enabled or disabled. Also,
the attacker does not need an account on the Argo CD instance in order
to exploit this. If anonymous access to the instance is enabled, an
attacker can escalate their privileges, effectively allowing them to
gain the same privileges on the cluster as the Argo CD instance, which
is cluster admin in a default installation. This will allow the
attacker to create, manipulate and delete any resource on the cluster.
They may also exfiltrate data by deploying malicious workloads with
elevated privileges, thus bypassing any redaction of sensitive data
otherwise enforced by the Argo CD API. A patch for this vulnerability
has been released in Argo CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. As a
workaround, one may disable anonymous access, but upgrading to a
patched version is preferable.

Hawk is an HTTP authentication scheme providing mechanisms for making
authenticated HTTP requests with partial cryptographic verification of
the request and response, covering the HTTP method, request URI, host,
and optionally the request payload. Hawk used a regular expression to
parse `Host` HTTP header (`Hawk.utils.parseHost()`), which was subject
to regular expression DoS attack - meaning each added character in the
attacker's input increases the computation time exponentially.
`parseHost()` was patched in `9.0.1` to use built-in `URL` class to
parse hostname instead. `Hawk.authenticate()` accepts `options`
argument. If that contains `host` and `port`, those would be used
instead of a call to `utils.parseHost()`.

Wire is a secure messaging application. Wire is vulnerable to

BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions
starting with 2.2 and prior to 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and 2.5.0-beta.2 are
vulnerable to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. By
using specific a RegularExpression, an attacker can cause denial of
service for the bbb-html5 service. The useragent library performs
checking of device by parsing the input of User-Agent header and lets
it go through lookupUserAgent() (alias of useragent.lookup() ). This
function handles input by regexing and attackers can abuse that by
providing some ReDos payload using `SmartWatch`. The maintainers
removed `htmlclient/useragent` from versions 2.3.19, 2.4.7, and
2.5.0-beta.2. As a workaround, disable NginX forwarding the requests
to the handler according to the directions in the GitHub Security
Advisory.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
In Grafana Enterprise, the Request security feature allows list allows
to configure Grafana in a way so that the instance doesn&#8217;t call or
only calls specific hosts. The vulnerability present starting with
version 7.4.0-beta1 and prior to versions 7.5.16 and 8.5.3 allows
someone to bypass these security configurations if a malicious
datasource (running on an allowed host) returns an HTTP redirect to a
forbidden host. The vulnerability only impacts Grafana Enterprise when
the Request security allow list is used and there is a possibility to
add a custom datasource to Grafana which returns HTTP redirects. In
this scenario, Grafana would blindly follow the redirects and
potentially give secure information to the clients. Grafana Cloud is
not impacted by this vulnerability. Versions 7.5.16 and 8.5.3 contain
a patch for this issue. There are currently no known workarounds.

Sourcegraph is a fast and featureful code search and navigation
engine. Versions before 3.38.0 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
in the gitserver service. The Gitolite code host integration with
Phabricator allows Sourcegraph site admins to specify a
`callsignCommand`, which is used to obtain the Phabricator metadata
for a Gitolite repository. An administrator who is able to edit or add
a Gitolite code host and has administrative access to Sourcegraph&#8217;s
bundled Grafana instance can change this command arbitrarily and run
it remotely. This grants direct access to the infrastructure
underlying the Sourcegraph installation. The attack requires: site-
admin privileges on the instance of Sourcegraph, Administrative
privileges on the bundled Grafana monitoring instance, Knowledge of
the gitserver IP address or DNS name (if running in Kubernetes). This
can be found through Grafana. The issue is patched in version 3.38.0.
You may disable Gitolite code hosts. We still highly encourage
upgrading regardless of workarounds.

Auth0 is an authentication broker that supports both social and
enterprise identity providers, including Active Directory, LDAP,
Google Apps, and Salesforce. In versions before `11.33.0`, when the
&#8220;additional signup fields&#8221; feature [is
configured](https://github.com/auth0/lock#additional-sign-up-fields),
a malicious actor can inject invalidated HTML code into these
additional fields, which is then stored in the service `user_metdata`
payload (using the `name` property). Verification emails, when
applicable, are generated using this metadata. It is therefor possible
for an actor to craft a malicious link by injecting HTML, which is
then rendered as the recipient's name within the delivered email
template. You are impacted by this vulnerability if you are using
`auth0-lock` version `11.32.2` or lower and are using the &#8220;additional
signup fields&#8221; feature in your application. Upgrade to version
`11.33.0`.

go-tuf is a Go implementation of The Update Framework (TUF). go-tuf
does not correctly implement the client workflow for updating the
metadata files for roles other than the root role. Specifically,
checks for rollback attacks are not implemented correctly meaning an
attacker can cause clients to install software that is older than the
software which the client previously knew to be available, and may
include software with known vulnerabilities. In more detail, the
client code of go-tuf has several issues in regards to preventing
rollback attacks: 1. It does not take into account the content of any
previously trusted metadata, if available, before proceeding with
updating roles other than the root role (i.e., steps 5.4.3.1 and 5.5.5
of the detailed client workflow). This means that any form of version
verification done on the newly-downloaded metadata is made using the
default value of zero, which always passes. 2. For both timestamp and
snapshot roles, go-tuf saves these metadata files as trusted before
verifying if the version of the metafiles they refer to is correct
(i.e., steps 5.5.4 and 5.6.4 of the detailed client workflow). A fix
is available in version 0.3.0 or newer. No workarounds are known for
this issue apart from upgrading.

Rubygems is a package registry used to supply software for the Ruby
language ecosystem. Due to a bug in the yank action, it was possible
for any RubyGems.org user to remove and replace certain gems even if
that user was not authorized to do so. To be vulnerable, a gem needed:
one or more dashes in its name creation within 30 days OR no updates
for over 100 days At present, we believe this vulnerability has not
been exploited. RubyGems.org sends an email to all gem owners when a
gem version is published or yanked. We have not received any support
emails from gem owners indicating that their gem has been yanked
without authorization. An audit of gem changes for the last 18 months
did not find any examples of this vulnerability being used in a
malicious way. A deeper audit for any possible use of this exploit is
ongoing, and we will update this advisory once it is complete. Using
Bundler in --frozen or --deployment mode in CI and during deploys, as
the Bundler team has always recommended, will guarantee that your
application does not silently switch to versions created using this
exploit. To audit your application history for possible past exploits,
review your Gemfile.lock and look for gems whose platform changed when
the version number did not change. For example, gemname-3.1.2 updating
to gemname-3.1.2-java could indicate a possible abuse of this
vulnerability. RubyGems.org has been patched and is no longer
vulnerable to this issue as of the 5th of May 2022.

Rundeck is an open source automation service with a web console,
command line tools and a WebAPI. Rundeck community and rundeck-
enterprise docker images contained a pre-generated SSH keypair. If the
id_rsa.pub public key of the keypair was copied to authorized_keys
files on remote host, those hosts would allow access to anyone with
the exposed private credentials. This misconfiguration only impacts
Rundeck Docker instances of PagerDuty Process Automation On Prem
(formerly Rundeck) version 4.0 and earlier, not Debian, RPM or .WAR.
Additionally, the id_rsa.pub file would have to be copied from the
Docker image filesystem contents without overwriting it and used to
configure SSH access on a host. A patch on Rundeck's `main` branch has
removed the pre-generated SSH key pair, but it does not remove exposed
keys that have been configured. To patch, users must run a script on
hosts in their environment to search for exposed keys and rotate them.
Two workarounds are available: Do not use any pre-existing public key
file from the rundeck docker images to allow SSH access by adding it
to authorized_keys files and, if you have copied the public key file
included in the docker image, remove it from any authorized_keys

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20220713 Git v2.37.1 and friends for CVE-2022-29187
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/14/1

Git is a distributed revision control system. Git prior to versions
2.37.1, 2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and 2.30.5, is
vulnerable to privilege escalation in all platforms. An unsuspecting
user could still be affected by the issue reported in CVE-2022-24765,
for example when navigating as root into a shared tmp directory that
is owned by them, but where an attacker could create a git repository.
Versions 2.37.1, 2.36.2, 2.35.4, 2.34.4, 2.33.4, 2.32.3, 2.31.4, and
2.30.5 contain a patch for this issue. The simplest way to avoid being
affected by the exploit described in the example is to avoid running
git as root (or an Administrator in Windows), and if needed to reduce
its use to a minimum. While a generic workaround is not possible, a
system could be hardened from the exploit described in the example by
removing any such repository if it exists already and creating one as
root to block any future attacks.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/stripe/smokescreen/commit/dea7b3c89df000f4072ff9866d61d78e30df6a36

Smokescreen is an HTTP proxy. The primary use case for Smokescreen is
to prevent server-side request forgery (SSRF) attacks in which
external attackers leverage the behavior of applications to connect to
or scan internal infrastructure. Smokescreen also offers an option to
deny access to additional (e.g., external) URLs by way of a deny list.
There was an issue in Smokescreen that made it possible to bypass the
deny list feature by surrounding the hostname with square brackets
(e.g. `[example.com]`). This only impacted the HTTP proxy
functionality of Smokescreen. HTTPS requests were not impacted.
Smokescreen version 0.0.4 contains a patch for this issue.

Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security.
Prior to version 2.1.4, a buffer that was used for inbound network
traffic had no upper limit. Pion DTLS would buffer all network traffic
from the remote user until the handshake completes or timed out. An
attacker could exploit this to cause excessive memory usage. Version
2.1.4 contains a patch for this issue. There are currently no known
workarounds available.

input arguments. This results in a `CHECK`-failure which can be used
to trigger a denial of service attack. The code assumes `dense_shape`
is a vector and `indices` is a matrix (as part of requirements for
sparse tensors) but there is no validation for this. Versions 2.9.0,
2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, there is a potential for
segfault / denial of service in TensorFlow by calling `tf.compat.v1.*`
ops which don't yet have support for quantized types, which was added
after migration to TensorFlow 2.x. In these scenarios, since the
kernel is missing, a `nullptr` value is passed to
`ParseDimensionValue` for the `py_value` argument. Then, this is
dereferenced, resulting in segfault. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and
2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.

In multiple places throughout the code, one may compute an index for a
write operation. However, the existing validation only checks against
the upper bound of the array. Hence, it is possible to write before
the array by massaging the input to generate negative values for
`loc`. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch for

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the macros that TensorFlow
uses for writing assertions (e.g., `CHECK_LT`, `CHECK_GT`, etc.) have
an incorrect logic when comparing `size_t` and `int` values. Due to
type conversion rules, several of the macros would trigger
incorrectly. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a patch
for this issue.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In version
2.8.0, the `TensorKey` hash function used total estimated
`AllocatedBytes()`, which (a) is an estimate per tensor, and (b) is a
very poor hash function for constants (e.g. `int32_t`). It also tried
to access individual tensor bytes through `tensor.data()` of size
`AllocatedBytes()`. This led to ASAN failures because the
`AllocatedBytes()` is an estimate of total bytes allocated by a
tensor, including any pointed-to constructs (e.g. strings), and does
not refer to contiguous bytes in the `.data()` buffer. The discoverers
could not use this byte vector anyway because types such as `tstring`
include pointers, whereas they needed to hash the string values
themselves. This issue is patched in Tensorflow versions 2.9.0 and
2.8.1.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, the implementation of
`tf.histogram_fixed_width` is vulnerable to a crash when the values
array contain `Not a Number` (`NaN`) elements. The implementation
assumes that all floating point operations are defined and then
converts a floating point result to an integer index. If `values`
contains `NaN` then the result of the division is still `NaN` and the
cast to `int32` would result in a crash. This only occurs on the CPU
implementation. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4 contain a
patch for this issue.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, certain TFLite models that
were created using TFLite model converter would crash when loaded in
the TFLite interpreter. The culprit is that during quantization the
scale of values could be greater than 1 but code was always assuming
sub-unit scaling. Thus, since code was calling
`QuantizeMultiplierSmallerThanOneExp`, the `TFLITE_CHECK_LT` assertion
would trigger and abort the process. Versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and
2.6.4 contain a patch for this issue.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. Prior to
versions 2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4, TensorFlow's
`saved_model_cli` tool is vulnerable to a code injection. This can be
used to open a reverse shell. This code path was maintained for
compatibility reasons as the maintainers had several test cases where
numpy expressions were used as arguments. However, given that the tool
is always run manually, the impact of this is still not severe. The
maintainers have now removed the `safe=False` argument, so all parsing
is done without calling `eval`. The patch is available in versions
2.9.0, 2.8.1, 2.7.2, and 2.6.4.

PyJWT is a Python implementation of RFC 7519. PyJWT supports multiple
different JWT signing algorithms. With JWT, an attacker submitting the
JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm. The PyJWT library
requires that the application chooses what algorithms are supported.
The application can specify `jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()`
to get support for all algorithms, or specify a single algorithm. The
issue is not that big as
`algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()` has to be used.
Users should upgrade to v2.4.0 to receive a patch for this issue. As a
workaround, always be explicit with the algorithms that are accepted
and expected when decoding.

uploads allowed some gems (with platforms ending in numbers, like
`arm64-darwin-21`) to be temporarily replaced in the CDN cache by a
malicious package. The bug has been patched, and is believed to have
never been exploited, based on an extensive review of logs and
existing gems by rubygems. The easiest way to ensure that an
application has not been exploited by this vulnerability is to verify
all downloaded .gems checksums match the checksum recorded in the
RubyGems.org database. RubyGems.org has been patched and is no longer

Lodestar is a TypeScript implementation of the Ethereum Consensus
specification. Prior to version 0.36.0, there is a possible consensus
split given maliciously-crafted `AttesterSlashing` or
`ProposerSlashing` being included on-chain. Because the developers
represent `uint64` values as native javascript `number`s, there is an
issue when those variables with large (greater than 2^53) `uint64`
values are included on chain. In those cases, Lodestar may view
valid_`AttesterSlashing` or `ProposerSlashing` as invalid, due to
rounding errors in large `number` values. This causes a consensus
split, where Lodestar nodes are forked away from the main network.
Similarly, Lodestar may consider invalid `ProposerSlashing` as valid,
thus including in proposed blocks that will be considered invalid by
the network. Version 0.36.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a
workaround, use `BigInt` to represent `Slot` and `Epoch` values in
`AttesterSlashing` and `ProposerSlashing` objects. `BigInt` is too
slow to be used in all `Slot` and `Epoch` cases, so one may carefully
use `BigInt` just where necessary for consensus.

github-action-merge-dependabot is an action that automatically
approves and merges dependabot pull requests (PRs). Prior to version
3.2.0, github-action-merge-dependabot does not check if a commit
created by dependabot is verified with the proper GPG key. There is
just a check if the actor is set to `dependabot[bot]` to determine if
the PR is a legit PR. Theoretically, an owner of a seemingly valid and
legit action in the pipeline can check if the PR is created by
dependabot and if their own action has enough permissions to modify
the PR in the pipeline. If so, they can modify the PR by adding a
second seemingly valid and legit commit to the PR, as they can set
arbitrarily the username and email in for commits in git. Because the
bot only checks if the actor is valid, it would pass the malicious
changes through and merge the PR automatically, without getting
noticed by project maintainers. It would probably not be possible to
determine where the malicious commit came from, as it would only say
`dependabot[bot]` and the corresponding email-address. Version 3.2.0
contains a patch for this issue.

Smarty is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of
presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. Prior to versions
3.1.45 and 4.1.1, template authors could inject php code by choosing a
malicious {block} name or {include} file name. Sites that cannot fully
trust template authors should upgrade to versions 3.1.45 or 4.1.1 to
receive a patch for this issue. There are currently no known
workarounds.

Pion DTLS is a Go implementation of Datagram Transport Layer Security.
Prior to version 2.1.5, a DTLS Client could provide a Certificate that
it doesn't posses the private key for and Pion DTLS wouldn't reject
it. This issue affects users that are using Client certificates only.
The connection itself is still secure. The Certificate provided by
clients can't be trusted when using a Pion DTLS server prior to
version 2.1.5. Users should upgrade to version 2.1.5 to receive a
patch. There are currently no known workarounds.

Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded
stack. In versions prior to 6.1.10, an attacker can cause a buffer
overflow by providing the Azure RTOS USBX host stack a HUB descriptor
with `bNbPorts` set to a value greater than `UX_MAX_TT` which defaults
to 8. For a `bNbPorts` value of 255, the implementation of
`ux_host_class_hub_descriptor_get` function will modify the contents
of `hub` -> `ux_host_class_hub_device` -> `ux_device_hub_tt` array
violating the end boundary by 255 - `UX_MAX_TT` items. The USB host
stack needs to validate the number of ports reported by the hub, and
if the value is larger than UX_MAX_TT, USB stack needs to reject the
request. This fix has been included in USBX release 6.1.10.

Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. Versions of envoy
prior to 1.22.1 are subject to a segmentation fault in the
GrpcHealthCheckerImpl. Envoy can perform various types of upstream
health checking. One of them uses gRPC. Envoy also has a feature which
can &#8220;hold&#8221; (prevent removal) upstream hosts obtained via service
discovery until configured active health checking fails. If an
attacker controls an upstream host and also controls service discovery
of that host (via DNS, the EDS API, etc.), an attacker can crash Envoy
by forcing removal of the host from service discovery, and then
failing the gRPC health check request. This will crash Envoy via a
null pointer dereference. Users are advised to upgrade to resolve this
vulnerability. Users unable to upgrade may disable gRPC health
checking and/or replace it with a different health checking type as a
mitigation.

Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to
1.22.1 secompressors accumulate decompressed data into an intermediate
buffer before overwriting the body in the decode/encodeBody. This may
allow an attacker to zip bomb the decompressor by sending a small
highly compressed payload. Maliciously constructed zip files may
exhaust system memory and cause a denial of service. Users are advised
to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may consider disabling

Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance proxy. In versions prior to
1.22.1 the OAuth filter implementation does not include a mechanism
for validating access tokens, so by design when the HMAC signed cookie
is missing a full authentication flow should be triggered. However,
the current implementation assumes that access tokens are always
validated thus allowing access in the presence of any access token
attached to the request. Users are advised to upgrade. There is no

Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In
versions prior to 1.22.1 if Envoy attempts to send an internal
redirect of an HTTP request consisting of more than HTTP headers,
there&#8217;s a lifetime bug which can be triggered. If while replaying the
request Envoy sends a local reply when the redirect headers are
processed, the downstream state indicates that the downstream stream
is not complete. On sending the local reply, Envoy will attempt to
reset the upstream stream, but as it is actually complete, and
deleted, this result in a use-after-free. Users are advised to

CaSS is a Competency and Skills System. CaSS Library,
(npm:cassproject) has a missing cryptographic step when storing
cryptographic keys that can allow a server administrator access to an
account&#8217;s cryptographic keys. This affects CaSS servers using
standalone username/password authentication, which uses a method that
expects e2e cryptographic security of authorization credentials. The
issue has been patched in 1.5.8, however, the vulnerable accounts are
only resecured when the user next logs in using standalone
authentication, as the data required to resecure the account is not
available to the server. The issue may be mitigated by using SSO or
client side certificates to log in. Please note that SSO and client
side certificate authentication does not have this expectation of no-
knowledge credential access, and cryptographic keys are available to
the server administrator.

Jupyter Notebook is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
computing. Prior to version 6.4.12, authenticated requests to the
notebook server with `ContentsManager.allow_hidden = False` only
prevented listing the contents of hidden directories, not accessing
individual hidden files or files in hidden directories (i.e. hidden
files were 'hidden' but not 'inaccessible'). This could lead to
notebook configurations allowing authenticated access to files that
may reasonably be expected to be disallowed. Because fully
authenticated requests are required, this is of relatively low impact.
But if a server's root directory contains sensitive files whose only
protection from the server is being hidden (e.g. `~/.ssh` while
serving $HOME), then any authenticated requests could access files if
their names are guessable. Such contexts also necessarily have full
access to the server and therefore execution permissions, which also
generally grants access to all the same files. So this does not
generally result in any privilege escalation or increase in
information access, only an additional, unintended means by which the
files could be accessed. Version 6.4.12 contains a patch for this
issue. There are currently no known workarounds.

Scylla is a real-time big data database that is API-compatible with
Apache Cassandra and Amazon DynamoDB. When decompressing CQL frame
received from user, Scylla assumes that user-provided uncompressed
length is correct. If user provides fake length, that is greater than
the real one, part of decompression buffer won't be overwritten, and
will be left uninitialized. This can be exploited in several ways,
depending on the privileges of the user. 1. The main exploit is that
an attacker with access to CQL port, but no user account, can bypass
authentication, but only if there are other legitimate clients making
connections to the cluster, and they use LZ4. 2. Attacker that already
has a user account on the cluster can read parts of uninitialized
memory, which can contain things like passwords of other users or
fragments of other queries / results, which leads to authorization
bypass and sensitive information disclosure. The bug has been patched
in the following versions: Scylla Enterprise: 2020.1.14, 2021.1.12,
2022.1.0. Scylla Open Source: 4.6.7, 5.0.3. Users unable to upgrade
should make sure none of their drivers connect to cluster using LZ4
compression, and that Scylla CQL port is behind firewall. Additionally
make sure no untrusted client can connect to Scylla, by setting up
authentication and applying workarounds from previous point (firewall,
no lz4 compression).

`root_dir` that contains the starting user's home directory, then the
underlying REST API can be used to leak the access token assigned at
start time by guessing/brute forcing the PID of the jupyter server.
While this requires an authenticated user session, this URL can be
used from a cross-site scripting payload or from a hooked or otherwise
compromised browser to leak this access token to a malicious third
party. This token can be used along with the REST API to interact with
Jupyter services/notebooks such as modifying or overwriting critical
files, such as .bashrc or .ssh/authorized_keys, allowing a malicious
user to read potentially sensitive data and possibly gain control of
the impacted system. This issue is patched in version 1.17.1.

SSH.NET is a Secure Shell (SSH) library for .NET. In versions 2020.0.0
and 2020.0.1, during an `X25519` key exchange, the client&#8217;s private
key is generated with `System.Random`. `System.Random` is not a
cryptographically secure random number generator, it must therefore
not be used for cryptographic purposes. When establishing an SSH
connection to a remote host, during the X25519 key exchange, the
private key is generated with a weak random number generator whose
seed can be brute forced. This allows an attacker who is able to
eavesdrop on the communications to decrypt them. Version 2020.0.2
contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may disable
support for `curve25519-sha256` and `curve25519-sha256@libssh.org` key

Azure RTOS USBX is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded
stack. Prior to version 6.1.11, he USBX DFU UPLOAD functionality may
be utilized to introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of
memory contents. In particular cases this may allow an attacker to
bypass security features or execute arbitrary code. The implementation
of `ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function does not assure that
a buffer overflow will not occur during handling of the DFU UPLOAD
command. When an attacker issues the
`UX_SLAVE_CLASS_DFU_COMMAND_UPLOAD` control transfer request with
`wLenght` larger than the buffer size
(`UX_SLAVE_REQUEST_CONTROL_MAX_LENGTH`, 256 bytes), depending on the
actual implementation of `dfu -> ux_slave_class_dfu_read`, a buffer
overflow may occur. In example `ux_slave_class_dfu_read` may read 4096
bytes (or more up to 65k) to a 256 byte buffer ultimately resulting in
an overflow. Furthermore in case an attacker has some control over the
read flash memory, this may result in execution of arbitrary code and
platform compromise. A fix for this issue has been included in USBX
release 6.1.11. As a workaround, align request and buffer size to
assure that buffer boundaries are respected.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/electron/electron/security/advisories/GHSA-mq8j-3h7h-p8g7

Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop
applications using JavaScript (JS), HTML, and CSS. A vulnerability in
versions prior to 18.0.0-beta.6, 17.2.0, 16.2.6, and 15.5.5 allows a
renderer with JS execution to obtain access to a new renderer process
with `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` enabled which in turn allows
effective access to `ipcRenderer`. The `nodeIntegrationInSubFrames`
option does not implicitly grant Node.js access. Rather, it depends on
the existing sandbox setting. If an application is sandboxed, then
`nodeIntegrationInSubFrames` just gives access to the sandboxed
renderer APIs, which include `ipcRenderer`. If the application then
additionally exposes IPC messages without IPC `senderFrame` validation
that perform privileged actions or return confidential data this
access to `ipcRenderer` can in turn compromise your application / user
even with the sandbox enabled. Electron versions 18.0.0-beta.6,
17.2.0, 16.2.6, and 15.5.5 contain a fix for this issue. As a
workaround, ensure that all IPC message handlers appropriately
validate `senderFrame`.

Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client. Guzzle prior to versions 6.5.6 and 7.4.3
contains a vulnerability with the cookie middleware. The vulnerability
is that it is not checked if the cookie domain equals the domain of
the server which sets the cookie via the Set-Cookie header, allowing a
malicious server to set cookies for unrelated domains. The cookie
middleware is disabled by default, so most library consumers will not
be affected by this issue. Only those who manually add the cookie
middleware to the handler stack or construct the client with
['cookies' => true] are affected. Moreover, those who do not use the
same Guzzle client to call multiple domains and have disabled redirect
forwarding are not affected by this vulnerability. Guzzle versions
6.5.6 and 7.4.3 contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, turn
off the cookie middleware.

silverstripe-omnipay is a SilverStripe integration with Omnipay PHP
payments library. For a subset of Omnipay gateways (those that use
intermediary states like `isNotification()` or `isRedirect()`), if the
payment identifier or success URL is exposed it is possible for
payments to be prematurely marked as completed without payment being
taken. This is mitigated by the fact that most payment gateways hide
this information from users, however some issuing banks offer flawed
3DSecure implementations that may inadvertently expose this data. The
following versions have been patched to fix this issue: `2.5.2`,
`3.0.2`, `3.1.4`, and `3.2.1`. There are no known workarounds for this

In ISC DHCP 4.4.0 -> 4.4.3, ISC DHCP 4.1-ESV-R1 -> 4.1-ESV-R16-P1,
when the function option_code_hash_lookup() is called from
add_option(), it increases the option's refcount field. However, there
is not a corresponding call to option_dereference() to decrement the
refcount field. The function add_option() is only used in server
responses to lease query packets. Each lease query response calls this
function for several options, so eventually, the reference counters
could overflow and cause the server to abort.

The Image Hover Effects Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
Stored Cross-Site Scripting via the Title & Description values that
can be added to an Image Hover in versions up to, and including, 9.7.3
due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes
it possible for authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web
scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an
injected page. By default, the plugin only allows administrators
access to edit Image Hovers, however, if a site admin makes the
plugin's features available to lower privileged users through the 'Who
Can Edit?' setting then this can be exploited by those users.

The WP Cerber Security plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to security
protection bypass in versions up to, and including 9.0, that makes
user enumeration possible. This is due to improper validation on the
value supplied through the 'author' parameter found in the ~/cerber-
load.php file. In vulnerable versions, the plugin only blocks requests
if the value supplied is numeric, making it possible for attackers to
supply additional non-numeric characters to bypass the protection. The
non-numeric characters are stripped and the user requested is
displayed. This can be used by unauthenticated attackers to gather
information about users that can targeted in further attacks.

This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
administrative privileges, to inject JavaScript code into the setting
that will execute whenever a user accesses the injected page. This
only affects multi-site installations and installations where
unfiltered_html has been disabled.

permission checks (e.g., to help ensure that a program was installed
by root) and without integrity checks (e.g., a checksum comparison
against known legitimate programs). Also, the vendor recommendation is
to install this agent software with root privileges. Thus, privilege
escalation is possible on systems where any of these pathnames is
controlled by a non-root user. An example is /opt/firebird/bin/isql,
where the /opt/firebird directory is often owned by the firebird user.

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in Qualys Cloud Agent 4.8.0-49.
It writes "ps auxwwe" output to the /var/log/qualys/qualys-cloud-
agent-scan.log file. This may, for example, unexpectedly write
credentials (from environment variables) to disk in cleartext. NOTE:
there are no common circumstances in which qualys-cloud-agent-scan.log
can be read by a user other than root; however, the file contents
could be exposed through site-specific operational practices. The
vendor does NOT characterize this as a vulnerability because the ps
data collection is intentional, and would only capture credentials on
a machine that was already affected by the CWE-214 weakness.

Due to an insecure design, the Lepin EP-KP001 flash drive through
KP001_V19 is vulnerable to an authentication bypass attack that
enables an attacker to gain access to the stored encrypted data.
Normally, the encrypted disk partition with this data is unlocked by
entering the correct passcode (6 to 14 digits) via the keypad and
pressing the Unlock button. This authentication is performed by an
unknown microcontroller. By replacing this microcontroller on a target
device with one from an attacker-controlled Lepin EP-KP001 whose
passcode is known, it is possible to successfully unlock the target
device and read the stored data in cleartext.

JTEKT TOYOPUC PLCs through 2022-04-29 do not ensure data integrity.
They utilize the unauthenticated CMPLink/TCP protocol for engineering

Control logic is downloaded to the PLC on a block-by-block basis with
a given memory address and a blob of machine code. The logic that is
downloaded to the PLC is not cryptographically authenticated, allowing
an attacker to execute arbitrary machine code on the PLC's CPU module

privileges, even administrative privileges. The application (even if
it implements a CSRF token for the random GET request) does not ever

(such as sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may trick the
users of a web application into executing actions of the attacker's

In UsbCoreDxe, tampering with the contents of the USB working buffer
using DMA while certain USB transactions are in process leads to a
TOCTOU problem that could be used by an attacker to cause SMRAM
corruption and escalation of privileges The UsbCoreDxe module creates
a working buffer for USB transactions outside of SMRAM. The code which
uses can be inside of SMM, making the working buffer untrusted input.
The buffer can be corrupted by DMA transfers. The SMM code code
attempts to sanitize pointers to ensure all pointers refer to the
working buffer, but when a pointer is not found in the list of
pointers to sanitize, the current action is not aborted, leading to
undefined behavior. This issue was discovered by Insyde engineering
based on the general description provided by Intel's iSTARE group.

The Trend Controls IC protocol through 2022-05-06 allows Cleartext
Transmission of Sensitive Information. According to FSCT-2022-0050,
there is a Trend Controls Inter-Controller (IC) protocol cleartext
transmission of credentials issue. The affected components are
characterized as: Inter-Controller (IC) protocol (57612/UDP). The
potential impact is: Compromise of credentials. Several Trend Controls
building automation controllers utilize the Inter-Controller (IC)
protocol in for information exchange and automation purposes. This
protocol offers authentication in the form of a 4-digit PIN in order
to protect access to sensitive operations like strategy uploads and
downloads as well as optional 0-30 character username and password
protection for web page access protection. Both the PIN and usernames
and passwords are transmitted in cleartext, allowing an attacker with
passive interception capabilities to obtain these credentials.
Credentials are transmitted in cleartext. An attacker who obtains
Trend IC credentials can carry out sensitive engineering actions such
as manipulating controller strategy or configuration settings. If the
credentials in question are (re)used for other applications, their
compromise could potentially facilitate lateral movement.

Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager through 2022-05-06 has Missing
Authentication for a Critical Function. According to FSCT-2022-0051,
there is a Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager multiple proprietary
protocols with unauthenticated functionality issue. The affected
components are characterized as: Honeywell Experion TCP (51000/TCP),
Safety Builder (51010/TCP). The potential impact is: Manipulate
controller state, Manipulate controller configuration, Manipulate
controller logic, Manipulate controller files, Manipulate IO. The
Honeywell Experion PKS Distributed Control System (DCS) Safety Manager
utilizes several proprietary protocols for a wide variety of
functionality, including process data acquisition, controller steering
and configuration management. These protocols include: Experion TCP
(51000/TCP) and Safety Builder (51010/TCP). None of these protocols
have any authentication features, allowing any attacker capable of
communicating with the ports in question to invoke (a subset of)
desired functionality. There is no authentication functionality on the
protocols in question. An attacker capable of invoking the protocols'
functionalities could achieve a wide range of adverse impacts,
including (but not limited to), the following: for Experion TCP
(51000/TCP): Issue IO manipulation commands, Issue file read/write
commands; and for Safety Builder (51010/TCP): Issue controller
start/stop commands, Issue logic download/upload commands, Issue file

with regards to some, but not all, of the above functionality is that
these require the Safety Manager physical keyswitch to be in the right

Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager 5.02 uses Hard-coded
Credentials. According to FSCT-2022-0052, there is a Honeywell
Experion PKS Safety Manager hardcoded credentials issue. The affected
components are characterized as: POLO bootloader. The potential impact
is: Manipulate firmware. The Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager
utilizes the DCOM-232/485 serial interface for firmware management
purposes. When booting, the Safety Manager exposes the Enea POLO
bootloader via this interface. Access to the boot configuration is
controlled by means of credentials hardcoded in the Safety Manager
firmware. The credentials for the bootloader are hardcoded in the
firmware. An attacker with access to the serial interface (either
through physical access, a compromised EWS or an exposed serial-to-
ethernet gateway) can utilize these credentials to control the boot
process and manipulate the unauthenticated firmware image (see
FSCT-2022-0054).

Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager (SM and FSC) through 2022-05-06
has Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity. According to
FSCT-2022-0053, there is a Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager
insufficient logic security controls issue. The affected components
are characterized as: Honeywell FSC runtime (FSC-CPU, QPP), Honeywell
Safety Builder. The potential impact is: Remote Code Execution, Denial
of Service. The Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager family of safety
controllers utilize the unauthenticated Safety Builder protocol
(FSCT-2022-0051) for engineering purposes, including downloading
projects and control logic to the controller. Control logic is
downloaded to the controller on a block-by-block basis. The logic that
is downloaded consists of FLD code compiled to native machine code for
the CPU module (which applies to both the Safety Manager and FSC
families). Since this logic does not seem to be cryptographically
authenticated, it allows an attacker capable of triggering a logic
download to execute arbitrary machine code on the controller's CPU
module in the context of the runtime. While the researchers could not
verify this in detail, the researchers believe that the microprocessor
underpinning the FSC and Safety Manager CPU modules is incapable of
offering memory protection or privilege separation capabilities which
would give an attacker full control of the CPU module. There is no
authentication on control logic downloaded to the controller. Memory
protection and privilege separation capabilities for the runtime are
possibly lacking. The researchers confirmed the issues in question on
Safety Manager R145.1 and R152.2 but suspect the issue affects all FSC
and SM controllers and associated Safety Builder versions regardless
of software or firmware revision. An attacker who can communicate with
a Safety Manager controller via the Safety Builder protocol can
execute arbitrary code without restrictions on the CPU module,
allowing for covert manipulation of control operations and implanting
capabilities similar to the TRITON malware (MITRE ATT&CK software ID
S1009). A mitigating factor with regards to some, but not all, of the
above functionality is that these require the Safety Manager physical
keyswitch to be in the right position.

Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager 5.02 has Insufficient
Verification of Data Authenticity. According to FSCT-2022-0054, there
is a Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager unauthenticated firmware
update issue. The affected components are characterized as: Firmware
update functionality. The potential impact is: Firmware manipulation.
The Honeywell Experion PKS Safety Manager utilizes the DCOM-232/485
communication FTA serial interface and Enea POLO bootloader for
firmware management purposes. An engineering workstation running the
Safety Builder software communicates via serial or serial-over-
ethernet link with the DCOM-232/485 interface. Firmware images were
found to have no authentication (in the form of firmware signing) and
only relied on insecure checksums for regular integrity checks.
Firmware images are unsigned. An attacker with access to the serial
interface (either through physical access, a compromised EWS or an
exposed serial-to-ethernet gateway) can utilize hardcoded credentials
(see FSCT-2022-0052) for the POLO bootloader to control the boot
process and push malicious firmware images to the controller allowing
for firmware manipulation, remote code execution and denial of service
impacts. A mitigating factor is that in order for a firmware update to
be initiated, the Safety Manager has to be rebooted which is typically
done by means of physical controls on the Safety Manager itself. As
such, an attacker would have to either lay dormant until a legitimate
reboot occurs or possibly attempt to force a reboot through a
secondary vulnerability.

to this service is permitted and credentials for the root user are
hardcoded without automatically changing them upon first
commissioning. The credentials for the SSH service are hardcoded in

Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 allows

Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus authentication bypass issue. The
affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP)
authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The
Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol
(5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to
configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive
engineering functionality. Authentication functions on the basis of a
MAC/IP whitelist with inactivity timeout to which an authenticated
client's MAC/IP is stored. UDP traffic can be spoofed to bypass the
whitelist-based access control. Since UDP is stateless, an attacker
capable of passively observing traffic can spoof arbitrary messages
using the MAC/IP of an authenticated client. This allows the attacker
access to sensitive engineering functionality such as
uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller
configuration.

Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD through 2022-05-06 uses a Broken or
Risky Cryptographic Algorithm. According to FSCT-2022-0063, there is a
Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD S-Bus weak credential hashing scheme
issue. The affected components are characterized as: S-Bus (5050/UDP)
authentication. The potential impact is: Authentication bypass. The
Saia Burgess Controls (SBC) PCD controllers utilize the S-Bus protocol
(5050/UDP) for a variety of engineering purposes. It is possible to
configure a password in order to restrict access to sensitive
engineering functionality. Authentication is done by using the S-Bus
'write byte' message to a specific address and supplying a hashed
version of the password. The hashing algorithm used is based on CRC-16
and as such not cryptographically secure. An insecure hashing
algorithm is used. An attacker capable of passively observing traffic
can intercept the hashed credentials and trivially find collisions
allowing for authentication without having to bruteforce a keyspace
defined by the actual strength of the password. This allows the
attacker access to sensitive engineering functionality such as
uploading/downloading control logic and manipulating controller
configuration.

If a Thunderbird user replied to a crafted HTML email containing a
<code>meta</code> tag, with the <code>meta</code> tag having the
<code>http-equiv="refresh"</code> attribute, and the content attribute
specifying an URL, then Thunderbird started a network request to that
URL, regardless of the configuration to block remote content. In
combination with certain other HTML elements and attributes in the
email, it was possible to execute JavaScript code included in the
message in the context of the message compose document. The JavaScript
code was able to perform actions including, but probably not limited
to, read and modify the contents of the message compose document,
including the quoted original message, which could potentially contain
the decrypted plaintext of encrypted data in the crafted email. The
contents could then be transmitted to the network, either to the URL
specified in the META refresh tag, or to a different URL, as the
JavaScript code could modify the URL specified in the document. This
bug doesn't affect users who have changed the default Message Body
display setting to 'simple html' or 'plain text'. This vulnerability
affects Thunderbird < 102.2.1 and Thunderbird < 91.13.1.

An issue was discovered in the auth component in Dovecot 2.2 and 2.3
before 2.3.20. When two passdb configuration entries exist with the
same driver and args settings, incorrect username_filter and mechanism
settings can be applied to passdb definitions. These incorrectly
applied settings can lead to an unintended security configuration and
can permit privilege escalation in certain configurations. The
documentation does not advise against the use of passdb definitions
that have the same driver and args settings. One such configuration
would be where an administrator wishes to use the same PAM
configuration or passwd file for both normal and master users but use
the username_filter setting to restrict which of the users is able to
be a master user.

for other admin panel users that have a relationship (e.g., created
by, updated by) with content accessible to the authenticated user. For
example, a low-privileged &#8220;author&#8221; role account can view these details
in the JSON response for an &#8220;editor&#8221; or &#8220;super admin&#8221; that has updated

NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.16.1 is vulnerable
to a novel type of the "ghost domain names" attack. The vulnerability
works by targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a
subdomain of a rogue domain name. The rogue nameserver returns
delegation information for the subdomain that updates Unbound's
delegation cache. This action can be repeated before expiry of the
delegation information by querying Unbound for a second level
subdomain which the rogue nameserver provides new delegation
information. Since Unbound is a child-centric resolver, the ever-
updating child delegation information can keep a rogue domain name
resolvable long after revocation. From version 1.16.2 on, Unbound
checks the validity of parent delegation records before using cached
delegation information.

NLnet Labs Unbound, up to and including version 1.16.1, is vulnerable
to a novel type of the "ghost domain names" attack. The vulnerability
works by targeting an Unbound instance. Unbound is queried for a rogue
domain name when the cached delegation information is about to expire.
The rogue nameserver delays the response so that the cached delegation
information is expired. Upon receiving the delayed answer containing
the delegation information, Unbound overwrites the now expired
entries. This action can be repeated when the delegation information
is about to expire making the rogue delegation information ever-
updating. From version 1.16.2 on, Unbound stores the start time for a
query and uses that to decide if the cached delegation information can
be overwritten.

Violation of secure design principles exists in the communication of
CAMS for HIS. Affected products and versions are CENTUM series where
LHS4800 is installed (CENTUM CS 3000 and CENTUM CS 3000 Small R3.08.10
to R3.09.00), CENTUM series where CAMS function is used (CENTUM VP,
CENTUM VP Small, and CENTUM VP Basic R4.01.00 to R4.03.00), CENTUM
series regardless of the use of CAMS function (CENTUM VP, CENTUM VP
Small, and CENTUM VP Basic R5.01.00 to R5.04.20 and R6.01.00 to
R6.09.00), Exaopc R3.72.00 to R3.80.00 (only if NTPF100-S6 'For CENTUM
VP Support CAMS for HIS' is installed), B/M9000 CS R5.04.01 to
R5.05.01, and B/M9000 VP R6.01.01 to R8.03.01). If an adjacent
attacker successfully compromises a computer using CAMS for HIS
software, they can use credentials from the compromised machine to
access data from another machine using CAMS for HIS software. This can
lead to a disabling of CAMS for HIS software functions on any affected
machines, or information disclosure/alteration.

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:CVE-2022-3094
Reference: URL:https://kb.isc.org/docs/cve-2022-3094

Sending a flood of dynamic DNS updates may cause `named` to allocate
large amounts of memory. This, in turn, may cause `named` to exit due
to a lack of free memory. We are not aware of any cases where this has
been exploited. Memory is allocated prior to the checking of access
permissions (ACLs) and is retained during the processing of a dynamic
update from a client whose access credentials are accepted. Memory
allocated to clients that are not permitted to send updates is
released immediately upon rejection. The scope of this vulnerability
is limited therefore to trusted clients who are permitted to make
dynamic zone changes. If a dynamic update is REFUSED, memory will be
released again very quickly. Therefore it is only likely to be
possible to degrade or stop `named` by sending a flood of unaccepted
dynamic updates comparable in magnitude to a query flood intended to
achieve the same detrimental outcome. BIND 9.11 and earlier branches
are also affected, but through exhaustion of internal resources rather
than memory constraints. This may reduce performance but should not be
a significant problem for most servers. Therefore we don't intend to
address this for BIND versions prior to BIND 9.16. This issue affects
BIND 9 versions 9.16.0 through 9.16.36, 9.18.0 through 9.18.10, 9.19.0
through 9.19.8, and 9.16.8-S1 through 9.16.36-S1.

The implementation of backslash parsing in the Dart URI class for
versions prior to 2.18 and Flutter versions prior to 3.30 differs from
the WhatWG URL standards. Dart uses the RFC 3986 syntax, which creates

auth bypass in webapps interpreting URIs. We recommend updating Dart

FriendsofFlarum (FoF) Upload is an extension that handles file uploads
intelligently for your forum. If FoF Upload prior to version 1.2.3 is
configured to allow the uploading of SVG files ('image/svg+xml'),
navigating directly to an SVG file URI could execute arbitrary
Javascript code decided by an attacker. This Javascript code could
include the execution of HTTP web requests to Flarum, or any other web
service. This could allow data to be leaked by an authenticated Flarum
user, or, possibly, for data to be modified maliciously. This issue
has been patched with v1.2.3, which now sanitizes uploaded SVG files.
As a workaround, remove the ability for users to upload SVG files
through FoF Upload.

Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-
Agent library. Prior to version 1.13.8, an attacker can send a message
with evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, which may cause a crash. This type of
crash may be caused by a URL ending with `%`. Version 1.13.8 contains
a patch for this issue.

Sofia-SIP is an open-source Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) User-
Agent library. Prior to version 1.13.8, when parsing each line of a
sdp message, `rest = record + 2` will access the memory behind `\0`
and cause an out-of-bounds write. An attacker can send a message with
evil sdp to FreeSWITCH, causing a crash or more serious consequence,
such as remote code execution. Version 1.13.8 contains a patch for
this issue.

CVEProject/cve-services is an open source project used to operate the
CVE services API. A conditional in 'data.js' has potential for
production secrets to be written to disk. The affected method writes
the generated randomKey to disk if the environment is not development.
If this method were called in production, it is possible that it would
write the plaintext key to disk. A patch is not available as of time
of publication but is anticipated as a "hot fix" for version 1.1.1 and
for the 2.x branch.

indy-node is the server portion of Hyperledger Indy, a distributed
ledger purpose-built for decentralized identity. In vulnerable
versions of indy-node, an attacker can max out the number of client
connections allowed by the ledger, leaving the ledger unable to be
used for its intended purpose. However, the ledger content will not be
impacted and the ledger will resume functioning after the attack. This
attack exploits the trade-off between resilience and availability. Any
protection against abusive client connections will also prevent the
network being accessed by certain legitimate users. As a result,
validator nodes must tune their firewall rules to ensure the right
trade-off for their network's expected users. The guidance to network
operators for the use of firewall rules in the deployment of Indy
networks has been modified to better protect against denial of service
attacks by increasing the cost and complexity in mounting such
attacks. The mitigation for this vulnerability is not in the
Hyperledger Indy code per se, but rather in the individual deployments
of Indy. The mitigations should be applied to all deployments of Indy,
and are not related to a particular release.

eLabFTW is an electronic lab notebook manager for research teams.
Prior to version 4.3.0, a vulnerability allows an authenticated user
with an administrator role in a team to assign itself system
administrator privileges within the application, or create a new
system administrator account. The issue has been corrected in eLabFTW
version 4.3.0. In the context of eLabFTW, an administrator is a user
account with certain privileges to manage users and content in their
assigned team/teams. A system administrator account can manage all
accounts, teams and edit system-wide settings within the application.
The impact is not deemed as high, as it requires the attacker to have
access to an administrator account. Regular user accounts cannot
exploit this to gain admin rights. A workaround for one if the issues
is removing the ability of administrators to create accounts.

RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging and streaming broker. In
affected versions the shovel and federation plugins perform URI
obfuscation in their worker (link) state. The encryption key used to
encrypt the URI was seeded with a predictable secret. This means that
in case of certain exceptions related to Shovel and Federation
plugins, reasonably easily deobfuscatable data could appear in the
node log. Patched versions correctly use a cluster-wide secret for
that purpose. This issue has been addressed and Patched versions:
`3.10.2`, `3.9.18`, `3.8.32` are available. Users unable to upgrade
should disable the Shovel and Federation plugins.

wire-ios is an iOS client for the Wire secure messaging application.
Invalid accent colors of Wire communication partners may render the
iOS Wire Client partially unusable by causing it to crash multiple
times on launch. These invalid accent colors can be used by and sent
between Wire users. The root cause was an unnecessary assert statement
when converting an integer value into the corresponding enum value,
causing an exception instead of a fallback to a default value. This
issue is fixed in [wire-ios](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-
ios/commit/caa0e27dbe51f9edfda8c7a9f017d93b8cfddefb) and in Wire for
iOS 3.100. There is no workaround available, but users may use other
Wire clients (such as the [web app](https://app.wire.com)) to continue
using Wire, or upgrade their client.

Nextcloud server is an open source personal cloud server. Affected
versions were found to be vulnerable to SMTP command injection. The
impact varies based on which commands are supported by the backend
SMTP server. However, the main risk here is that the attacker can then
hijack an already-authenticated SMTP session and run arbitrary SMTP
commands as the email user, such as sending emails to other users,
changing the FROM user, and so on. As before, this depends on the
configuration of the server itself, but newlines should be sanitized
to mitigate such arbitrary SMTP command injection. It is recommended
that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 22.2.8 , 23.0.5 or 24.0.1.
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3.
Waitress versions 2.1.0 and 2.1.1 may terminate early due to a thread
closing a socket while the main thread is about to call select(). This
will lead to the main thread raising an exception that is not handled
and then causing the entire application to be killed. This issue has
been fixed in Waitress 2.1.2 by no longer allowing the WSGI thread to
close the socket. Instead, that is always delegated to the main
thread. There is no work-around for this issue. However, users using
waitress behind a reverse proxy server are less likely to have issues
if the reverse proxy always reads the full response.

Play Framework is a web framework for Java and Scala. A denial of
service vulnerability has been discovered in verions 2.8.3 through
2.8.15 of Play's forms library, in both the Scala and Java APIs. This
can occur when using either the `Form#bindFromRequest` method on a
JSON request body or the `Form#bind` method directly on a JSON value.
If the JSON data being bound to the form contains a deeply-nested JSON
object or array, the form binding implementation may consume all
available heap space and cause an `OutOfMemoryError`. If executing on
the default dispatcher and `akka.jvm-exit-on-fatal-error` is
enabled&#8212;as it is by default&#8212;then this can crash the application
process. `Form.bindFromRequest` is vulnerable when using any body
parser that produces a type of `AnyContent` or `JsValue` in Scala, or
one that can produce a `JsonNode` in Java. This includes Play's
default body parser. This vulnerability been patched in version
2.8.16. There is now a global limit on the depth of a JSON object that
can be parsed, which can be configured by the user if necessary. As a
workaround, applications that do not need to parse a request body of
type `application/json` can switch from the default body parser to
another body parser that supports only the specific type of body they
expect.
