Name: CVE-2022-25332
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:TETRA:BURST
Reference: URL:https://tetraburst.com/

The AES implementation in the Texas Instruments OMAP L138 (secure
variants), present in mask ROM, suffers from a timing side channel
which can be exploited by an adversary with non-secure supervisor
privileges by managing cache contents and collecting timing
information for different ciphertext inputs. Using this side channel,
the SK_LOAD secure kernel routine can be used to recover the Customer
Encryption Key (CEK).

======================================================
Name: CVE-2022-25333
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:TETRA:BURST
Reference: URL:https://tetraburst.com/

The Texas Instruments OMAP L138 (secure variants) trusted execution
environment (TEE) performs an RSA check implemented in mask ROM when
loading a module through the SK_LOAD routine. However, only the module
header authenticity is validated. An adversary can re-use any
correctly signed header and append a forged payload, to be encrypted
using the CEK (obtainable through CVE-2022-25332) in order to obtain
arbitrary code execution in secure context. This constitutes a full
break of the TEE security architecture.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2022-25334
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:TETRA:BURST
Reference: URL:https://tetraburst.com/

The Texas Instruments OMAP L138 (secure variants) trusted execution
environment (TEE) lacks a bounds check on the signature size field in
the SK_LOAD module loading routine, present in mask ROM. A module with
a sufficiently large signature field causes a stack overflow,
affecting secure kernel data pages. This can be leveraged to obtain
arbitrary code execution in secure supervisor context by overwriting a
SHA256 function pointer in the secure kernel data area when loading a
forged, unsigned SK_LOAD module encrypted with the CEK (obtainable
through CVE-2022-25332). This constitutes a full break of the TEE
security architecture.

The Transposh WordPress Translation plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
to unauthorized setting changes by unauthenticated users in versions
up to, and including, 1.0.8.1. This is due to insufficient validation
of settings on the 'tp_translation' AJAX action which makes it
possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass any restrictions and
influence the data shown on the site. Please note this is a separate
issue from CVE-2022-2461. Notes from the researcher: When installed
Transposh comes with a set of pre-configured options, one of these is
the "Who can translate" setting under the "Settings" tab. However,
this option is largely ignored, if Transposh has enabled its
"autotranslate" feature (it's enabled by default) and the HTTP POST
parameter "sr0" is larger than 0. This is caused by a faulty
validation in "wp/transposh_db.php."

A heap out-of-bounds memory write exists in FFMPEG since version 5.1.
The size calculation in `build_open_gop_key_points()` goes through all

`sc->sample_offsets_count`. This can lead to an integer overflow
resulting in a small allocation with `av_calloc()`. An attacker can

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20220328 CVE-2022-25757: Apache APISIX: the body_schema check in request-validation plugin can be bypassed
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/03/28/2

In Apache APISIX before 2.13.0, when decoding JSON with duplicate
keys, lua-cjson will choose the last occurred value as the result. By
passing a JSON with a duplicate key, the attacker can bypass the
body_schema validation in the request-validation plugin. For example,
`{"string_payload":"bad","string_payload":"good"}` can be used to hide
the "bad" input. Systems satisfy three conditions below are affected
by this attack: 1. use body_schema validation in the request-
validation plugin 2. upstream application uses a special JSON library
that chooses the first occurred value, like jsoniter or gojay 3.
upstream application does not validate the input anymore. The fix in
APISIX is to re-encode the validated JSON input back into the request
body at the side of APISIX. Improper Input Validation vulnerability in
__COMPONENT__ of Apache APISIX allows an attacker to __IMPACT__. This
issue affects Apache APISIX Apache APISIX version 2.12.1 and prior
versions.

This affects the package com.diffplug.gradle:goomph before 3.37.2. It
allows a malicious zip file to potentially break out of the expected
destination directory, writing contents into arbitrary locations on
the file system. Overwriting certain files/directories could allow an
attacker to achieve remote code execution on a target system by
exploiting this vulnerability. **Note:** This could have allowed a
malicious zip file to extract itself into an arbitrary directory. The
only file that Goomph extracts is the p2 bootstrapper and eclipse
metadata files hosted at eclipse.org, which are not malicious, so the
only way this vulnerability could have affected you is if you had set
a custom bootstrap zip, and that zip was malicious.

A vulnerability was found in PostgreSQL. This attack requires
permission to create non-temporary objects in at least one schema, the
ability to lure or wait for an administrator to create or update an
affected extension in that schema, and the ability to lure or wait for
a victim to use the object targeted in CREATE OR REPLACE or CREATE IF
NOT EXISTS. Given all three prerequisites, this flaw allows an
attacker to run arbitrary code as the victim role, which may be a
superuser.

An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice
existed where determining if a macro was signed by a trusted author
was done by only matching the serial number and issuer string of the
used certificate with that of a trusted certificate. This is not
sufficient to verify that the macro was actually signed with the
certificate. An adversary could therefore create an arbitrary
certificate with a serial number and an issuer string identical to a
trusted certificate which LibreOffice would present as belonging to
the trusted author, potentially leading to the user to execute
arbitrary code contained in macros improperly trusted. This issue
affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2 versions prior to
7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.1.

LibreOffice supports the storage of passwords for web connections in
the user&#8217;s configuration database. The stored passwords are encrypted
with a single master key provided by the user. A flaw in LibreOffice
existed where master key was poorly encoded resulting in weakening its
entropy from 128 to 43 bits making the stored passwords vulerable to a
brute force attack if an attacker has access to the users stored
config. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7.2
versions prior to 7.2.7; 7.3 versions prior to 7.3.3.

A shortcoming in the HMEF package of poi-scratchpad (Apache POI)
allows an attacker to cause an Out of Memory exception. This package
is used to read TNEF files (Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Exchange
Server). If an application uses poi-scratchpad to parse TNEF files and
the application allows untrusted users to supply them, then a
carefully crafted file can cause an Out of Memory exception. This
issue affects poi-scratchpad version 5.2.0 and prior versions. Users
are recommended to upgrade to poi-scratchpad 5.2.1.

Racy interactions between dirty vram tracking and paging log dirty
hypercalls Activation of log dirty mode done by
XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram (was named HVMOP_track_dirty_vram before Xen
4.9) is racy with ongoing log dirty hypercalls. A suitably timed call
to XEN_DMOP_track_dirty_vram can enable log dirty while another CPU is
still in the process of tearing down the structures related to a
previously enabled log dirty mode (XEN_DOMCTL_SHADOW_OP_OFF). This is
due to lack of mutually exclusive locking between both operations and
can lead to entries being added in already freed slots, resulting in a
memory leak.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/04/05/3

IOMMU: RMRR (VT-d) and unity map (AMD-Vi) handling issues T[his CNA
information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text explains which
aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.] Certain PCI devices
in a system might be assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified via
Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR") for Intel VT-d or Unity
Mapping ranges for AMD-Vi. These are typically used for platform tasks
such as legacy USB emulation. Since the precise purpose of these
regions is unknown, once a device associated with such a region is
active, the mappings of these regions need to remain continuouly
accessible by the device. This requirement has been violated.
Subsequent DMA or interrupts from the device may have unpredictable
behaviour, ranging from IOMMU faults to memory corruption.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/06/09/3

x86 pv: Race condition in typeref acquisition Xen maintains a type
reference count for pages, in addition to a regular reference count.
This scheme is used to maintain invariants required for Xen's safety,
e.g. PV guests may not have direct writeable access to pagetables;
updates need auditing by Xen. Unfortunately, the logic for acquiring a
type reference has a race condition, whereby a safely TLB flush is
issued too early and creates a window where the guest can re-establish
the read/write mapping before writeability is prohibited.

The Security Team noticed that the termination condition of the for
loop in the readExternal method is a controllable variable, which, if
tampered with, may lead to CPU exhaustion. As a fix, we added an upper
bound and termination condition in the read and write logic. We
classify it as a "low-priority but useful improvement". SystemDS is a
distributed system and needs to serialize/deserialize data but in many
code paths (e.g., on Spark broadcast/shuffle or writing to sequence
files) the byte stream is anyway protected by additional CRC
fingerprints. In this particular case though, the number of decoders
is upper-bounded by twice the number of columns, which means an
attacker would need to modify two entries in the byte stream in a
consistent manner. By adding these checks robustness was strictly
improved with almost zero overhead. These code changes are available
in versions higher than 2.2.1.

In Python before 3.10.3 on Windows, local users can gain privileges
because the search path is inadequately secured. The installer may
allow a local attacker to add user-writable directories to the system
search path. To exploit, an administrator must have installed Python
for all users and enabled PATH entries. A non-administrative user can
trigger a repair that incorrectly adds user-writable paths into PATH,
enabling search-path hijacking of other users and system services.
This affects Python (CPython) through 3.7.12, 3.8.x through 3.8.12,
3.9.x through 3.9.10, and 3.10.x through 3.10.2.

An issue was discovered in Pidgin before 2.14.9. A remote attacker who
can spoof DNS responses can redirect a client connection to a
malicious server. The client will perform TLS certificate verification
of the malicious domain name instead of the original XMPP service
domain, allowing the attacker to take over control over the XMPP
connection and to obtain user credentials and all communication
content. This is similar to CVE-2022-24968.

Xecurify's miniOrange Premium, Standard, and Enterprise Drupal SAML SP
modules possess an authentication and authorization bypass
vulnerability. An attacker with access to a HTTP-request intercepting
method is able to bypass authentication and authorization by removing
the SAML Assertion Signature - impersonating existing users and
existing roles, including administrative users/roles. This
vulnerability is not mitigated by configuring the module to enforce
signatures or certificate checks. Xecurify recommends updating
miniOrange modules to their most recent versions. This vulnerability
is present in paid versions of the miniOrange Drupal SAML SP product
affecting Drupal 7, 8, and 9.

In Apache Hadoop, The unTar function uses unTarUsingJava function on
Windows and the built-in tar utility on Unix and other OSes. As a
result, a TAR entry may create a symlink under the expected extraction
directory which points to an external directory. A subsequent TAR
entry may extract an arbitrary file into the external directory using
the symlink name. This however would be caught by the same
targetDirPath check on Unix because of the getCanonicalPath call.
However on Windows, getCanonicalPath doesn't resolve symbolic links,
which bypasses the check. unpackEntries during TAR extraction follows
symbolic links which allows writing outside expected base directory on
Windows. This was addressed in Apache Hadoop 3.2.3

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20220315 CVE-2022-26779: Apache Cloudstack insecure random number generation affects project email invitation
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/03/15/1

Apache CloudStack prior to 4.16.1.0 used insecure random number
generation for project invitation tokens. If a project invite is
created based only on an email address, a random token is generated.
An attacker with knowledge of the project ID and the fact that the
invite is sent, could generate time deterministic tokens and brute
force attempt to use them prior to the legitimate receiver accepting
the invite. This feature is not enabled by default, the attacker is
required to know or guess the project ID for the invite in addition to
the invitation token, and the attacker would need to be an existing
authorized user of CloudStack.

Remote Desktop Protocol Client Information Disclosure Vulnerability

======================================================
Name: CVE-2022-26941
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:TETRA:BURST
Reference: URL:https://tetraburst.com/

A format string vulnerability exists in Motorola MTM5000 series
firmware AT command handler for the AT+CTGL command. An attacker-
controllable string is improperly handled, allowing for a write-
anything-anywhere scenario. This can be leveraged to obtain arbitrary
code execution inside the teds_app binary, which runs with root
privileges.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2022-26942
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:TETRA:BURST
Reference: URL:https://tetraburst.com/

The Motorola MTM5000 series firmwares lack pointer validation on
arguments passed to trusted execution environment (TEE) modules. Two
modules are used, one responsible for KVL key management and the other
for TETRA cryptographic functionality. In both modules, an adversary
with non-secure supervisor level code execution can exploit the issue
in order to gain secure supervisor code execution within the TEE. This
constitutes a full break of the TEE module, exposing the device key as
well as any TETRA cryptographic keys and the confidential TETRA
cryptographic primitives.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2022-26943
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:TETRA:BURST
Reference: URL:https://tetraburst.com/

The Motorola MTM5000 series firmwares generate TETRA authentication
challenges using a PRNG using a tick count register as its sole
entropy source. Low boottime entropy and limited re-seeding of the
pool renders the authentication challenge vulnerable to two attacks.
First, due to the limited boottime pool entropy, an adversary can
derive the contents of the entropy pool by an exhaustive search of
possible values, based on an observed authentication challenge.
Second, an adversary can use knowledge of the entropy pool to predict
authentication challenges. As such, the unit is vulnerable to
CVE-2022-24400.

Reference: MISC:https://security.gradle.com/advisory/2022-03

Gradle Enterprise before 2021.4.3 relies on cleartext data
transmission in some situations. It uses Keycloak for identity
management services. During the sign-in process, Keycloak sets browser
cookies that effectively provide remember-me functionality. For
backwards compatibility with older Safari versions, Keycloak sets a
duplicate of the cookie without the Secure attribute, which allows the
cookie to be sent when accessing the location that cookie is set for
via HTTP. This creates the potential for an attacker (with the ability
to impersonate the Gradle Enterprise host) to capture the login
session of a user by having them click an http:// link to the server,
despite the real server requiring HTTPS.

A CSRF issue in /api/crontab on iRZ Mobile Routers through 2022-03-16
allows a threat actor to create a crontab entry in the router
administration panel. The cronjob will consequently execute the entry
on the threat actor's defined interval, leading to remote code
execution, allowing the threat actor to gain filesystem access. In
addition, if the router's default credentials aren't rotated or a
threat actor discovers valid credentials, remote code execution can be
achieved without user interaction.

receive and send cookies. curl's "cookie engine" can bebuilt with or

PSL support not provided, a more rudimentary check exists to atleast
prevent cookies from being set on TLDs. This check was broken if
thehost name in the URL uses a trailing dot.This can allow arbitrary

left unconfigured by the firmwares, an adversary with control over
either core can trivially gain code execution on the other, by
overwriting code located in shared RAM or DDR2 memory regions.
