Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent 1.0.34 listens on port 9000 for
incoming commands over HTTPS from Manage Engine Server. The HTTPS
certificates are not verified which allows any arbitrary user on the
network to send commands over port 9000. While these commands may not
be executed (due to authtoken validation), the Asset Explorer agent
will reach out to the manage engine server for an HTTP request. During
this process, AEAgent.cpp allocates 0x66 bytes using "malloc". This
memory is never free-ed in the program, causing a memory leak.
Additionally, the instruction sent to aeagent (ie: NEWSCAN, DELTASCAN,
etc) is converted to a unicode string, but is never freed. These
memory leaks allow a remote attacker to exploit a Denial of Service
scenario through repetitively sending these commands to an agent and
eventually crashing it the agent due to an out-of-memory condition.

Due to the Asset Explorer agent not validating HTTPS certificates, an
attacker on the network can statically configure their IP address to
match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This will allow an
attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent on the network
as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying its authtoken.
In AEAgent.cpp, the agent responding back over HTTP is vulnerable to a
Heap Overflow if the POST payload response is too large. The POST
payload response is converted to Unicode using vswprintf. This is
written to a buffer only 0x2000 bytes big. If POST payload is larger,
then heap overflow will occur.

Due to Manage Engine Asset Explorer Agent 1.0.34 not validating HTTPS
certificates, an attacker on the network can statically configure
their IP address to match the Asset Explorer's Server IP address. This
will allow an attacker to send a NEWSCAN request to a listening agent
on the network as well as receive the agent's HTTP request verifying
its authtoken. In httphandler.cpp, the agent reaching out over HTTP is
vulnerable to an Integer Overflow, which can be turned into a Heap
Overflow allowing for remote code execution as NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM on
the agent machine. The Integer Overflow occurs when receiving POST
response from the Manage Engine server, and the agent calling
"HttpQueryInfoW" in order to get the "Content-Length" size from the
incoming POST request. This size is taken, but multiplied to a larger
amount. If an attacker specifies a Content-Length size of 1073741823
or larger, this integer arithmetic will wrap the value back around to
smaller integer, then calls "calloc" with this size to allocate
memory. The following API "InternetReadFile" will copy the POST data
into this buffer, which will be too small for the contents, and cause
heap overflow.

in the menu rendering code performs a length calculation on the
assumption that expressing a quoted single quote will require 3
characters, while it actually requires 4 characters which allows an
attacker to corrupt memory by one byte for each quote in the input.
The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality
and integrity as well as system availability.

It was found in OpenShift Container Platform 4 that ignition config,
served by the Machine Config Server, can be accessed externally from
clusters without authentication. The MCS endpoint (port 22623)
provides ignition configuration used for bootstrapping Nodes and can
include some sensitive data, e.g. registry pull secrets. There are two
scenarios where this data can be accessed. The first is on Baremetal,
OpenStack, Ovirt, Vsphere and KubeVirt deployments which do not have a
separate internal API endpoint and allow access from outside the
cluster to port 22623 from the standard OpenShift API Virtual IP
address. The second is on cloud deployments when using unsupported
network plugins, which do not create iptables rules that prevent to
port 22623. In this scenario, the ignition config is exposed to all
pods within the cluster and cannot be accessed externally.

An authentication flaw was found in ceph in versions before 14.2.20.
When the monitor handles CEPHX_GET_AUTH_SESSION_KEY requests, it
doesn't sanitize other_keys, allowing key reuse. An attacker who can
request a global_id can exploit the ability of any user to request a
global_id previously associated with another user, as ceph does not
force the reuse of old keys to generate new ones. The highest threat

A deadlock vulnerability was found in 'github.com/containers/storage'
in versions before 1.28.1. When a container image is processed, each
layer is unpacked using `tar`. If one of those layers is not a valid
`tar` archive this causes an error leading to an unexpected situation
where the code indefinitely waits for the tar unpacked stream, which
never finishes. An attacker could use this vulnerability to craft a
malicious image, which when downloaded and stored by an application
using containers/storage, would then cause a deadlock leading to a
Denial of Service (DoS).

Missing fixes for CVE-2021-40438 and CVE-2021-26691 in the versions of
httpd, as shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.5.0, causes a security
regression compared to the versions shipped in Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 8.4. A user who installs or updates to Red Hat Enterprise Linux
8.5.0 would be vulnerable to the mentioned CVEs, even if they were
properly fixed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.4. CVE-2021-20325 was
assigned to that Red Hat specific security regression and it does not
affect the upstream versions of httpd.

Specific versions of the MongoDB C# Driver may erroneously publish
events containing authentication-related data to a command listener
configured by an application. The published events may contain
security-sensitive data when commands such as "saslStart",
"saslContinue", "isMaster", "createUser", and "updateUser" are
executed. Without due care, an application may inadvertently expose
this authenticated-related information, e.g., by writing it to a log
file. This issue only arises if an application enables the command
listener feature (this is not enabled by default). This issue affects
the MongoDB C# Driver v2.12 versions prior to and including 2.12.1.

Vulnerability in the Oracle Outside In Technology product of Oracle
Fusion Middleware (component: Outside In Filters). Supported versions
that are affected are 8.5.4 and 8.5.5. Easily exploitable
vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via
HTTP to compromise Oracle Outside In Technology. Successful attacks of
this vulnerability can result in unauthorized creation, deletion or
modification access to critical data or all Oracle Outside In
Technology accessible data as well as unauthorized read access to a
subset of Oracle Outside In Technology accessible data and
unauthorized ability to cause a partial denial of service (partial
DOS) of Oracle Outside In Technology. Note: Outside In Technology is a
suite of software development kits (SDKs). The protocol and CVSS score
depend on the software that uses the Outside In Technology code. The
CVSS score assumes that the software passes data received over a
network directly to Outside In Technology code, but if data is not
received over a network the CVSS score may be lower. CVSS 3.1 Base
Score 8.6 (Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability impacts). CVSS

spring-boot-actuator-logview in a library that adds a simple logfile
viewer as spring boot actuator endpoint. It is maven package
"eu.hinsch:spring-boot-actuator-logview". In spring-boot-actuator-
logview before version 0.2.13 there is a directory traversal
vulnerability. The nature of this library is to expose a log file
directory via admin (spring boot actuator) HTTP endpoints. Both the
filename to view and a base folder (relative to the logging folder
root) can be specified via request parameters. While the filename
parameter was checked to prevent directory traversal exploits (so that
`filename=../somefile` would not work), the base folder parameter was
not sufficiently checked, so that `filename=somefile&base=../` could
access a file outside the logging base directory). The vulnerability
has been patched in release 0.2.13. Any users of 0.2.12 should be able
to update without any issues as there are no other changes in that
release. There is no workaround to fix the vulnerability other than
updating or removing the dependency. However, removing read access of
the user the application is run with to any directory not required for
running the application can limit the impact. Additionally, access to
the logview endpoint can be limited by deploying the application
behind a reverse proxy.

kamadak-exif is an exif parsing library written in pure Rust. In
kamadak-exif version 0.5.2, there is an infinite loop in parsing
crafted PNG files. Specifically, reader::read_from_container can cause
an infinite loop when a crafted PNG file is given. This is fixed in
version 0.5.3. No workaround is available. Applications that do not
pass files with the PNG signature to Reader::read_from_container are
not affected.

CairoSVG is a Python (pypi) package. CairoSVG is an SVG converter
based on Cairo. In CairoSVG before version 2.5.1, there is a regular
expression denial of service (REDoS) vulnerability. When processing
SVG files, the python package CairoSVG uses two regular expressions
which are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (REDoS).
If an attacker provides a malicious SVG, it can make cairosvg get
stuck processing the file for a very long time. This is fixed in
version 2.5.1. See Referenced GitHub advisory for more information.

Git LFS is a command line extension for managing large files with Git.
On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a
git.bat or git.exe file in the current directory, that program would
be executed, permitting the attacker to execute arbitrary code. This
does not affect Unix systems. This is the result of an incomplete fix
for CVE-2020-27955. This issue occurs because on Windows, Go includes
(and prefers) the current directory when the name of a command run
does not contain a directory separator. Other than avoiding untrusted
repositories or using a different operating system, there is no
workaround. This is fixed in v2.13.2.

PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard.
PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic
signature vulnerability. All users of pysaml2 that need to validate
signed SAML documents are impacted. The vulnerability is a variant of
XML Signature wrapping because it did not validate the SAML document
against an XML schema. This allowed invalid XML documents to be

PySAML2 is a pure python implementation of SAML Version 2 Standard.
PySAML2 before 6.5.0 has an improper verification of cryptographic
signature vulnerability. Users of pysaml2 that use the default
CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend and need to verify signed SAML documents
are impacted. PySAML2 does not ensure that a signed SAML document is
correctly signed. The default CryptoBackendXmlSec1 backend is using
the xmlsec1 binary to verify the signature of signed SAML documents,
but by default xmlsec1 accepts any type of key found within the given
document. xmlsec1 needs to be configured explicitly to only use only
_x509 certificates_ for the verification process of the SAML document
signature. This is fixed in PySAML2 6.5.0.

The Python "Flask-Security-Too" package is used for adding security

maintained version of Flask-Security based on the 3.0.0 version of
Flask-Security. In Flask-Security-Too from version 3.3.0 and before
version 3.4.5, the /login and /change endpoints can return the
authenticated user's authentication token in response to a GET
request. Since GET requests aren't protected with a CSRF token, this
could lead to a malicious 3rd party site acquiring the authentication
token. Version 3.4.5 and version 4.0.0 are patched. As a workaround,
if you aren't using authentication tokens - you can set the
SECURITY_TOKEN_MAX_AGE to "0" (seconds) which should make the token
unusable.

OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version
4.0.3, AttachmentUploadServlet also saves user controlled data
(`request.getInputStream()`) to a user specified location
(`request.getHeader("File-Name")`). This issue may lead to arbitrary
file upload which can be used to upload a WebShell to OneDev server.
This issue is addressed in 4.0.3 by only allowing uploaded file to be
in attachments folder. The webshell issue is not possible as OneDev
never executes files in attachments folder.

OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version
4.0.3, the REST UserResource endpoint performs a security check to
make sure that only administrators can list user details. However for
the `/users/{id}` endpoint there are no security checks enforced so it
is possible to retrieve arbitrary user details including their Access
Tokens! These access tokens can be used to access the API or clone
code in the build spec via the HTTP(S) protocol. It has permissions to
all projects accessible by the user account. This issue may lead to
`Sensitive data leak` and leak the Access Token which can be used to
impersonate the administrator or any other users. This issue was
addressed in 4.0.3 by removing user info from restful api.

OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version
4.0.3, the application's BasePage registers an AJAX event listener
(`AbstractPostAjaxBehavior`) in all pages other than the login page.
This listener decodes and deserializes the `data` query parameter. We
can access this listener by submitting a POST request to any page.
This issue may lead to `post-auth RCE` This endpoint is subject to
authentication and, therefore, requires a valid user to carry on the
attack. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by encrypting serialization
payload with secrets only known to server.

OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version
4.0.3, there is a critical vulnerability involving the build endpoint
parameters. InputSpec is used to define parameters of a Build spec. It
does so by using dynamically generated Groovy classes. A user able to
control job parameters can run arbitrary code on OneDev's server by
injecting arbitrary Groovy code. The ultimate result is in the
injection of a static constructor that will run arbitrary code. For a
full example refer to the referenced GHSA. This issue was addressed in

OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version
4.0.3, there is an issue involving YAML parsing which can lead to
post-auth remote code execution. In order to parse and process YAML
files, OneDev uses SnakeYaml which by default (when not using
`SafeConstructor`) allows the instantiation of arbitrary classes. We
can leverage that to run arbitrary code by instantiating classes such
as `javax.script.ScriptEngineManager` and using `URLClassLoader` to
load the script engine provider, resulting in the instantiation of a
user controlled class. For a full example refer to the referenced
GHSA. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3 by only allowing certain known

OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version
4.0.3, there is a critical vulnerability which may lead to arbitrary
file read. When BuildSpec is provided in XML format, the spec is
processed by XmlBuildSpecMigrator.migrate(buildSpecString); which
processes the XML document without preventing the expansion of
external entities. These entities can be configured to read arbitrary
files from the file system and dump their contents in the final XML
document to be migrated. If the files are dumped in properties
included in the YAML file, it will be possible for an attacker to read
them. If not, it is possible for an attacker to exfiltrate the
contents of these files Out Of Band. This issue was addressed in 4.0.3

OneDev is an all-in-one devops platform. In OneDev before version
4.0.3 there is a critical "zip slip" vulnerability. This issue may
lead to arbitrary file write. The KubernetesResource REST endpoint
untars user controlled data from the request body using TarUtils.
TarUtils is a custom library method leveraging Apache Commons
Compress. During the untar process, there are no checks in place to
prevent an untarred file from traversing the file system and
overriding an existing file. For a successful exploitation, the
attacker requires a valid __JobToken__ which may not be possible to
get without using any of the other reported vulnerabilities. But this
should be considered a vulnerability in
`io.onedev.commons.utils.TarUtils` since it lives in a different
artifact and can affect other projects using it. This issue was
addressed in 4.0.3 by validating paths in tar archive to only allow
them to be in specified folder when extracted.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
internet of things devices. The RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite
implementations in the Contiki-NG operating system versions prior to
4.6 do not validate the address pointer in the RPL source routing
header This makes it possible for an attacker to cause out-of-bounds
writes with packets injected into the network stack. Specifically, the
problem lies in the rpl_ext_header_srh_update function in the two rpl-
ext-header.c modules for RPL-Classic and RPL-Lite respectively. The
addr_ptr variable is calculated using an unvalidated CMPR field value
from the source routing header. An out-of-bounds write can be

Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed
desktop applications on Linux. A bug was discovered in the `flatpak-
portal` service that can allow sandboxed applications to execute
arbitrary code on the host system (a sandbox escape). This sandbox-
escape bug is present in versions from 0.11.4 and before fixed
versions 1.8.5 and 1.10.0. The Flatpak portal D-Bus service (`flatpak-
portal`, also known by its D-Bus service name
`org.freedesktop.portal.Flatpak`) allows apps in a Flatpak sandbox to
launch their own subprocesses in a new sandbox instance, either with
the same security settings as the caller or with more restrictive
security settings. For example, this is used in Flatpak-packaged web
browsers such as Chromium to launch subprocesses that will process
untrusted web content, and give those subprocesses a more restrictive
sandbox than the browser itself. In vulnerable versions, the Flatpak
portal service passes caller-specified environment variables to non-
sandboxed processes on the host system, and in particular to the
`flatpak run` command that is used to launch the new sandbox instance.
A malicious or compromised Flatpak app could set environment variables
that are trusted by the `flatpak run` command, and use them to execute
arbitrary code that is not in a sandbox. As a workaround, this
vulnerability can be mitigated by preventing the `flatpak-portal`
service from starting, but that mitigation will prevent many Flatpak
apps from working correctly. This is fixed in versions 1.8.5 and
1.10.0.

Laravel is a web application framework. Versions of Laravel before
6.20.11, 7.30.2 and 8.22.1 contain a query binding exploitation. This
same exploit applies to the illuminate/database package which is used
by Laravel. If a request is crafted where a field that is normally a
non-array value is an array, and that input is not validated or cast
to its expected type before being passed to the query builder, an
unexpected number of query bindings can be added to the query. In some
situations, this will simply lead to no results being returned by the
query builder; however, it is possible certain queries could be
affected in a way that causes the query to return unexpected results.

October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the
Laravel PHP Framework. In October before version 1.1.2, when running
on poorly configured servers (i.e. the server routes any request,
regardless of the HOST header to an October CMS instance) the
potential exists for Host Header Poisoning attacks to succeed. This
has been addressed in version 1.1.2 by adding a feature to allow a set
of trusted hosts to be specified in the application. As a workaround
one may set the configuration setting cms.linkPolicy to force.

openHAB is a vendor and technology agnostic open source automation
software for your home. In openHAB before versions 2.5.12 and 3.0.1
the XML external entity (XXE) attack allows attackers in the same
network as the openHAB instance to retrieve internal information like
the content of files from the file system. Responses to SSDP requests
can be especially malicious. All add-ons that use SAX or JAXB parsing
of externally received XML are potentially subject to this kind of
attack. In openHAB, the following add-ons are potentially impacted:
AvmFritz, BoseSoundtouch, DenonMarantz, DLinkSmarthome, Enigma2,
FmiWeather, FSInternetRadio, Gce, Homematic, HPPrinter, IHC, Insteon,
Onkyo, Roku, SamsungTV, Sonos, Roku, Tellstick, TR064, UPnPControl,
Vitotronic, Wemo, YamahaReceiver and XPath Tranformation. The
vulnerabilities have been fixed in versions 2.5.12 and 3.0.1 by a more
strict configuration of the used XML parser.

Tendermint Core is an open source Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT)
middleware that takes a state transition machine - written in any
programming language - and securely replicates it on many machines.
Tendermint Core v0.34.0 introduced a new way of handling evidence of
misbehavior. As part of this, we added a new Timestamp field to
Evidence structs. This timestamp would be calculated using the same
algorithm that is used when a block is created and proposed. (This
algorithm relies on the timestamp of the last commit from this
specific block.) In Tendermint Core v0.34.0-v0.34.2, the consensus
reactor is responsible for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence whenever
double signs are observed. However, the current block is still &#8220;in
flight&#8221; when it is being formed by the consensus reactor. It hasn&#8217;t
been finalized through network consensus yet. This means that
different nodes in the network may observe different &#8220;last commits&#8221;
when assigning a timestamp to DuplicateVoteEvidence. In turn,
different nodes could form DuplicateVoteEvidence objects at the same
height but with different timestamps. One DuplicateVoteEvidence object
(with one timestamp) will then eventually get finalized in the block,
but this means that any DuplicateVoteEvidence with a different
timestamp is considered invalid. Any node that formed invalid
DuplicateVoteEvidence will continue to propose invalid evidence; its
peers may see this, and choose to disconnect from this node. This bug
means that double signs are DoS vectors in Tendermint Core
v0.34.0-v0.34.2. Tendermint Core v0.34.3 is a security release which
fixes this bug. As of v0.34.3, DuplicateVoteEvidence is no longer
formed by the consensus reactor; rather, the consensus reactor passes
the Votes themselves into the EvidencePool, which is now responsible
for forming DuplicateVoteEvidence. The EvidencePool has timestamp info
that should be consistent across the network, which means that
DuplicateVoteEvidence formed in this reactor should have consistent
timestamps. This release changes the API between the consensus and
evidence reactors.

ORAS is open source software which enables a way to push OCI Artifacts
to OCI Conformant registries. ORAS is both a CLI for initial testing
and a Go Module. In ORAS from version 0.4.0 and before version 0.9.0,
there is a "zip-slip" vulnerability. The directory support feature
allows the downloaded gzipped tarballs to be automatically extracted
to the user-specified directory where the tarball can have symbolic
links and hard links. A well-crafted tarball or tarballs allow
malicious artifact providers linking, writing, or overwriting specific
files on the host filesystem outside of the user-specified directory
unexpectedly with the same permissions as the user who runs `oras
pull`. Users of the affected versions are impacted if they are `oras`
CLI users who runs `oras pull`, or if they are Go programs, which
invoke `github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`. The problem
has been fixed in version 0.9.0. For `oras` CLI users, there is no
workarounds other than pulling from a trusted artifact provider. For
`oras` package users, the workaround is to not use
`github.com/deislabs/oras/pkg/content.FileStore`, and use other
content stores instead, or pull from a trusted artifact provider.

Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi
package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated
Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.25.0, requests
to user provided domains were not restricted to external IP addresses
when calculating the key validity for third-party invite events and
sending push notifications. This could cause Synapse to make requests
to internal infrastructure. The type of request was not controlled by
the user, although limited modification of request bodies was
possible. For the most thorough protection server administrators
should remove the deprecated `federation_ip_range_blacklist` from
their settings after upgrading to Synapse v1.25.0 which will result in
Synapse using the improved default IP address restrictions. See the
new `ip_range_blacklist` and `ip_range_whitelist` settings if more

Polr is an open source URL shortener. in Polr before version 2.3.0, a
vulnerability in the setup process allows attackers to gain admin
access to site instances, even if they do not possess an existing
account. This vulnerability exists regardless of users' settings. If
an attacker crafts a request with specific cookie headers to the
/setup/finish endpoint, they may be able to obtain admin privileges on
the instance. This is caused by a loose comparison (==) in
SetupController that is susceptible to attack. The project has been
patched to ensure that a strict comparison (===) is used to verify the
setup key, and that /setup/finish verifies that no users table exists
before performing any migrations or provisioning any new accounts.
This is fixed in version 2.3.0. Users can patch this vulnerability
without upgrading by adding abort(404) to the very first line of
finishSetup in SetupController.php.

angular-expressions is "angular's nicest part extracted as a

before version 1.1.2 there is a vulnerability which allows Remote Code
Execution if you call "expressions.compile(userControlledInput)" where
"userControlledInput" is text that comes from user input. The security
of the package could be bypassed by using a more complex payload,
using a ".constructor.constructor" technique. In terms of impact: If
running angular-expressions in the browser, an attacker could run any
browser script when the application code calls
expressions.compile(userControlledInput). If running angular-
expressions on the server, an attacker could run any Javascript
expression, thus gaining Remote Code Execution. This is fixed in
version 1.1.2 of angular-expressions A temporary workaround might be
either to disable user-controlled input that will be fed into angular-
expressions in your application or allow only following characters in
the userControlledInput.

Flarum is an open source discussion platform for websites. The "Flarum
Sticky" extension versions 0.1.0-beta.14 and 0.1.0-beta.15 has a
cross-site scripting vulnerability. A change in release beta 14 of the
Sticky extension caused the plain text content of the first post of a
pinned discussion to be injected as HTML on the discussion list. The
issue was discovered following an internal audit. Any HTML would be
injected through the m.trust() helper. This resulted in an HTML
injection where <script> tags would not be executed. However it was
possible to run javascript from other HTML attributes, enabling a
cross-site scripting (XSS) attack to be performed. Since the exploit
only happens with the first post of a pinned discussion, an attacker
would need the ability to pin their own discussion, or be able to edit
a discussion that was previously pinned. On forums where all pinned
posts are authored by your staff, you can be relatively certain the
vulnerability has not been exploited. Forums where some user-created
discussions were pinned can look at the first post edit date to find
whether the vulnerability might have been exploited. Because Flarum
doesn't store the post content history, you cannot be certain if a
malicious edit was reverted. The fix will be available in version
v0.1.0-beta.16 with Flarum beta 16. The fix has already been back-
ported to Flarum beta 15 as version v0.1.0-beta.15.1 of the Sticky
extension. Forum administrators can disable the Sticky extension until
they are able to apply the update. The vulnerability cannot be
exploited while the extension is disabled.

In Docker before versions 9.03.15, 20.10.3 there is a vulnerability
involving the --userns-remap option in which access to remapped root
allows privilege escalation to real root. When using "--userns-remap",
if the root user in the remapped namespace has access to the host
filesystem they can modify files under "/var/lib/docker/<remapping>"
that cause writing files with extended privileges. Versions 20.10.3
and 19.03.15 contain patches that prevent privilege escalation from
remapped user.

MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under Apache
License v2.0. In MinIO before version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z
there is a server-side request forgery vulnerability. The target
application may have functionality for importing data from a URL,
publishing data to a URL, or otherwise reading data from a URL that
can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this
functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by
manipulating how URLs are built (path traversal etc.). In a Server-
Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse
functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The
attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the
server will read or submit data, and by carefully selecting the URLs,
the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS
metadata, connect to internal services like HTTP enabled databases, or
perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended
to be exposed. This is fixed in version RELEASE.2021-01-30T00-20-58Z,
all users are advised to upgrade. As a workaround you can disable the
browser front-end with "MINIO_BROWSER=off" environment variable.

2.7.7 there is a command injection vulnerability. Affected versions of
mechanize allow for OS commands to be injected using several classes'
methods which implicitly use Ruby's Kernel.open method. Exploitation
is possible only if untrusted input is used as a local filename and
passed to any of these calls: Mechanize::CookieJar#load,
Mechanize::CookieJar#save_as, Mechanize#download,
Mechanize::Download#save, Mechanize::File#save, and
Mechanize::FileResponse#read_body. This is fixed in version 2.7.7.

Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance
protocol servers & clients. In Netty before version 4.1.59.Final there
is a vulnerability on Unix-like systems involving an insecure temp
file. When netty's multipart decoders are used local information
disclosure can occur via the local system temporary directory if
temporary storing uploads on the disk is enabled. On unix-like
systems, the temporary directory is shared between all user. As such,
writing to this directory using APIs that do not explicitly set the
file/directory permissions can lead to information disclosure. Of
note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating Systems. The method
"File.createTempFile" on unix-like systems creates a random file, but,
by default will create this file with the permissions "-rw-r--r--".
Thus, if sensitive information is written to this file, other local
users can read this information. This is the case in netty's
"AbstractDiskHttpData" is vulnerable. This has been fixed in version
4.1.59.Final. As a workaround, one may specify your own
"java.io.tmpdir" when you start the JVM or use
"DefaultHttpDataFactory.setBaseDir(...)" to set the directory to
something that is only readable by the current user.

OAuth2 Proxy is an open-source reverse proxy and static file server
that provides authentication using Providers (Google, GitHub, and
others) to validate accounts by email, domain or group. In OAuth2
Proxy before version 7.0.0, for users that use the whitelist domain
feature, a domain that ended in a similar way to the intended domain
could have been allowed as a redirect. For example, if a whitelist
domain was configured for ".example.com", the intention is that
subdomains of example.com are allowed. Instead, "example.com" and
"badexample.com" could also match. This is fixed in version 7.0.0
onwards. As a workaround, one can disable the whitelist domain feature
and run separate OAuth2 Proxy instances for each subdomain.

Traccar is an open source GPS tracking system. In Traccar before
version 4.12 there is an unquoted Windows binary path vulnerability.
Only Windows versions are impacted. Attacker needs write access to the
filesystem on the host machine. If Java path includes a space, then
attacker can lift their privilege to the same as Traccar service
(system). This is fixed in version 4.12.

blaze is a Scala library for building asynchronous pipelines, with a
focus on network IO. All servers running blaze-core before version
0.14.15 are affected by a vulnerability in which unbounded connection
acceptance leads to file handle exhaustion. Blaze, accepts connections
unconditionally on a dedicated thread pool. This has the net effect of
amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their
current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted
and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket
handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound
higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed
connections. The vast majority of affected users are using it as part
of http4s-blaze-server <= 0.21.16. http4s provides a mechanism for
limiting open connections, but is enforced inside the Blaze accept
loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket opened. Thus,
the limit only prevents the number of connections which can be
simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which can be
held open. The issue is fixed in version 0.14.15 for
"NIO1SocketServerGroup". A "maxConnections" parameter is added, with a
default value of 512. Concurrent connections beyond this limit are
rejected. To run unbounded, which is not recommended, set a negative
number. The "NIO2SocketServerGroup" has no such setting and is now
deprecated. There are several possible workarounds described in the
refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xmw9-q7x9-j5qc.

Http4s (http4s-blaze-server) is a minimal, idiomatic Scala interface
for HTTP services. Http4s before versions 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and
1.0.0-M14 have a vulnerability which can lead to a denial-of-service.
Blaze-core, a library underlying http4s-blaze-server, accepts
connections unboundedly on its selector pool. This has the net effect
of amplifying degradation in services that are unable to handle their
current request load, since incoming connections are still accepted
and added to an unbounded queue. Each connection allocates a socket
handle, which drains a scarce OS resource. This can also confound
higher level circuit breakers which work based on detecting failed
connections. http4s provides a general "MaxActiveRequests" middleware
mechanism for limiting open connections, but it is enforced inside the
Blaze accept loop, after the connection is accepted and the socket
opened. Thus, the limit only prevents the number of connections which
can be simultaneously processed, not the number of connections which
can be held open. In 0.21.17, 0.22.0-M2, and 1.0.0-M14, a new
"maxConnections" property, with a default value of 1024, has been
added to the `BlazeServerBuilder`. Setting the value to a negative
number restores unbounded behavior, but is strongly disrecommended.
The NIO2 backend does not respect `maxConnections`. Its use is now
deprecated in http4s-0.21, and the option is removed altogether
starting in http4s-0.22. There are several possible workarounds
described in the refrenced GitHub Advisory GHSA-xhv5-w9c5-2r2w.

Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance
protocol servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2)
before version 4.1.60.Final there is a vulnerability that enables
request smuggling. If a Content-Length header is present in the
original HTTP/2 request, the field is not validated by
`Http2MultiplexHandler` as it is propagated up. This is fine as long
as the request is not proxied through as HTTP/1.1. If the request
comes in as an HTTP/2 stream, gets converted into the HTTP/1.1 domain
objects (`HttpRequest`, `HttpContent`, etc.) via
`Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec `and then sent up to the child
channel's pipeline and proxied through a remote peer as HTTP/1.1 this
may result in request smuggling. In a proxy case, users may assume the
content-length is validated somehow, which is not the case. If the
request is forwarded to a backend channel that is a HTTP/1.1
connection, the Content-Length now has meaning and needs to be
checked. An attacker can smuggle requests inside the body as it gets
downgraded from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1. For an example attack refer to the
linked GitHub Advisory. Users are only affected if all of this is
true: `HTTP2MultiplexCodec` or `Http2FrameCodec` is used,
`Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec` is used to convert to HTTP/1.1
objects, and these HTTP/1.1 objects are forwarded to another remote
peer. This has been patched in 4.1.60.Final As a workaround, the user
can do the validation by themselves by implementing a custom
`ChannelInboundHandler` that is put in the `ChannelPipeline` behind
`Http2StreamFrameToHttpObjectCodec`.

Fleet is an open source osquery manager. In Fleet before version 3.7.0
a malicious actor with a valid node key can send a badly formatted
request that causes the Fleet server to exit, resulting in denial of
service. This is possible only while a live query is currently
ongoing. We believe the impact of this vulnerability to be low given
the requirement that the actor has a valid node key. There is no
information disclosure, privilege escalation, or code execution. The
issue is fixed in Fleet 3.7.0.

Pollution vulnerability in the admin API. A badly formed request can
modify the prototype of the default JavaScript Object with the
potential to affect the default behaviour of the Node-RED runtime. The
vulnerability is patched in the 1.2.8 release. A workaround is to
ensure only authorized users are able to access the editor url.

hyper is an open-source HTTP library for Rust (crates.io). In hyper
from version 0.12.0 and before versions 0.13.10 and 0.14.3 there is a
vulnerability that can enable a request smuggling attack. The HTTP
server code had a flaw that incorrectly understands some requests with
multiple transfer-encoding headers to have a chunked payload, when it
should have been rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream
HTTP proxy that understands the request payload boundary differently
can result in "request smuggling" or "desync attacks". To determine if
vulnerable, all these things must be true: 1) Using hyper as an HTTP
server (the client is not affected), 2) Using HTTP/1.1 (HTTP/2 does
not use transfer-encoding), 3) Using a vulnerable HTTP proxy upstream
to hyper. If an upstream proxy correctly rejects the illegal transfer-
encoding headers, the desync attack cannot succeed. If there is no
proxy upstream of hyper, hyper cannot start the desync attack, as the
client will repair the headers before forwarding. This is fixed in
versions 0.14.3 and 0.13.10. As a workaround one can take the
following options: 1) Reject requests that contain a `transfer-
encoding` header, 2) Ensure any upstream proxy handles `transfer-
encoding` correctly.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/09/3

Git is an open-source distributed revision control system. In affected
versions of Git a specially crafted repository that contains symbolic
links as well as files using a clean/smudge filter such as Git LFS,
may cause just-checked out script to be executed while cloning onto a
case-insensitive file system such as NTFS, HFS+ or APFS (i.e. the
default file systems on Windows and macOS). Note that clean/smudge
filters have to be configured for that. Git for Windows configures Git
LFS by default, and is therefore vulnerable. The problem has been
patched in the versions published on Tuesday, March 9th, 2021. As a
workaound, if symbolic link support is disabled in Git (e.g. via `git
config --global core.symlinks false`), the described attack won't
work. Likewise, if no clean/smudge filters such as Git LFS are
configured globally (i.e. _before_ cloning), the attack is foiled. As
always, it is best to avoid cloning repositories from untrusted
sources. The earliest impacted version is 2.14.2. The fix versions
are: 2.30.1, 2.29.3, 2.28.1, 2.27.1, 2.26.3, 2.25.5, 2.24.4, 2.23.4,
2.22.5, 2.21.4, 2.20.5, 2.19.6, 2.18.5, 2.17.62.17.6.

Helm is open-source software which is essentially "The Kubernetes
Package Manager". Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are
packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources. In Helm from version
3.0 and before version 3.5.2, there a few cases where data loaded from
potentially untrusted sources was not properly sanitized. When a
SemVer in the `version` field of a chart is invalid, in some cases
Helm allows the string to be used "as is" without sanitizing. Helm
fails to properly sanitized some fields present on Helm repository
`index.yaml` files. Helm does not properly sanitized some fields in
the `plugin.yaml` file for plugins In some cases, Helm does not
properly sanitize the fields in the `Chart.yaml` file. By exploiting
these attack vectors, core maintainers were able to send deceptive
information to a terminal screen running the `helm` command, as well
as obscure or alter information on the screen. In some cases, we could
send codes that terminals used to execute higher-order logic, like
clearing a terminal screen. Further, during evaluation, the Helm
maintainers discovered a few other fields that were not properly
sanitized when read out of repository index files. This fix remedies
all such cases, and once again enforces SemVer2 policies on version
fields. All users of the Helm 3 should upgrade to the fixed version
3.5.2 or later. Those who use Helm as a library should verify that
they either sanitize this data on their own, or use the proper Helm
API calls to sanitize the data.

CarrierWave is an open-source RubyGem which provides a simple and
flexible way to upload files from Ruby applications. In CarrierWave
before versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1, there is a code injection
vulnerability. The "#manipulate!" method inappropriately evals the
content of mutation option(:read/:write), allowing attackers to craft
a string that can be executed as a Ruby code. If an application
developer supplies untrusted inputs to the option, it will lead to
remote code execution(RCE). This is fixed in versions 1.3.2 and 2.1.1.

Redis is an open-source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In
affected versions of Redis an integer overflow bug in 32-bit Redis
version 4.0 or newer could be exploited to corrupt the heap and
potentially result with remote code execution. Redis 4.0 or newer uses
a configurable limit for the maximum supported bulk input size. By
default, it is 512MB which is a safe value for all platforms. If the
limit is significantly increased, receiving a large request from a
client may trigger several integer overflow scenarios, which would
result with buffer overflow and heap corruption. We believe this could
in certain conditions be exploited for remote code execution. By
default, authenticated Redis users have access to all configuration
parameters and can therefore use the &#8220;CONFIG SET proto-max-bulk-len&#8221;
to change the safe default, making the system vulnerable. **This
problem only affects 32-bit Redis (on a 32-bit system, or as a 32-bit
executable running on a 64-bit system).** The problem is fixed in
version 6.2, and the fix is back ported to 6.0.11 and 5.0.11. Make
sure you use one of these versions if you are running 32-bit Redis. An
additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
redis-server executable is to prevent clients from directly executing
`CONFIG SET`: Using Redis 6.0 or newer, ACL configuration can be used
to block the command. Using older versions, the `rename-command`
configuration directive can be used to rename the command to a random
string unknown to users, rendering it inaccessible. Please note that
this workaround may have an additional impact on users or operational
systems that expect `CONFIG SET` to behave in certain ways.

less-openui5 is an npm package which enables building OpenUI5 themes
with Less.js. In less-openui5 before version 0.10., when processing
theming resources (i.e. `*.less` files) with less-openui5 that
originate from an untrusted source, those resources might contain
JavaScript code which will be executed in the context of the build
process. While this is a feature of the Less.js library it is an
unexpected behavior in the context of OpenUI5 and SAPUI5 development.
Especially in the context of UI5 Tooling which relies on less-openui5.
An attacker might create a library or theme-library containing a
custom control or theme, hiding malicious JavaScript code in one of
the .less files. Refer to the referenced GHSA-3crj-w4f5-gwh4 for
examples. Starting with Less.js version 3.0.0, the Inline JavaScript
feature is disabled by default. less-openui5 however currently uses a
fork of Less.js v1.6.3. Note that disabling the Inline JavaScript
feature in Less.js versions 1.x, still evaluates code has additional
double codes around it. We decided to remove the inline JavaScript
evaluation feature completely from the code of our Less.js fork. This
fix is available in less-openui5 version 0.10.0.

Opencast is a free, open-source platform to support the management of
educational audio and video content. In Opencast before version 9.2
there is a vulnerability in which publishing an episode with strict
access rules will overwrite the currently set series access. This
allows for an easy denial of access for all users without superuser
privileges, effectively hiding the series. Access to series and series
metadata on the search service (shown in media module and player)
depends on the events published which are part of the series.
Publishing an event will automatically publish a series and update
access to it. Removing an event or republishing the event should do
the same. Affected versions of Opencast may not update the series
access or remove a published series if an event is being removed. On
removal of an episode, this may lead to an access control list for
series metadata with broader access rules than the merged access rules
of all remaining events, or the series metadata still being available
although all episodes of that series have been removed. This problem
is fixed in Opencast 9.2.

fastify-reply-from is an npm package which is a fastify plugin to
forward the current http request to another server. In fastify-reply-
from before version 4.0.2, by crafting a specific URL, it is possible
to escape the prefix of the proxied backend service. If the base url
of the proxied server is "/pub/", a user expect that accessing "/priv"
on the target service would not be possible. In affected versions, it
is possible. This is fixed in version 4.0.2.

Brave is an open source web browser with a focus on privacy and
security. In Brave versions 1.17.73-1.20.103, the CNAME adblocking
feature added in Brave 1.17.73 accidentally initiated DNS requests
that bypassed the Brave Tor proxy. Users with adblocking enabled would
leak DNS requests from Tor windows to their DNS provider. (DNS
requests that were not initiated by CNAME adblocking would go through
Tor as expected.) This is fixed in Brave version 1.20.108

GLPI is an open-source asset and IT management software package that
provides ITIL Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software
auditing. In GLPI before version 9.5.4 there is an Insecure Direct
Object Reference (IDOR) on "Solutions". This vulnerability gives an
unauthorized user the ability to enumerate GLPI items names (including
users logins) using the knowbase search form (requires
authentication). To Reproduce: Perform a valid authentication at your
GLPI instance, Browse the ticket list and select any open ticket,
click on Solution form, then Search a solution form that will redirect
you to the endpoint /"glpi/front/knowbaseitem.php?item_itemtype=Ticket
&item_items_id=18&forcetab=Knowbase$1", and the item_itemtype=Ticket
parameter present in the previous URL will point to the PHP alias of
glpi_tickets table, so just replace it with "Users" to point to
glpi_users table instead; in the same way, item_items_id=18 will point
to the related column id, so changing it too you should be able to
enumerate all the content which has an alias. Since such id(s) are
obviously incremental, a malicious party could exploit the
vulnerability simply by guessing-based attempts.

Vapor is a web framework for Swift. In Vapor before version 4.40.1,
there is a DoS attack against anyone who Bootstraps a metrics backend
for their Vapor app. The following is the attack vector: 1. send
unlimited requests against a vapor instance with different paths. this
will create unlimited counters and timers, which will eventually drain
the system. 2. downstream services might suffer from this attack as
well by being spammed with error paths. This has been patched in
4.40.1. The `DefaultResponder` will rewrite any undefined route paths
for to `vapor_route_undefined` to avoid unlimited counters.

aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio
and Python. In aiohttp before version 3.7.4 there is an open redirect
vulnerability. A maliciously crafted link to an aiohttp-based web-
server could redirect the browser to a different website. It is caused
by a bug in the `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware`
middleware. This security problem has been fixed in 3.7.4. Upgrade
your dependency using pip as follows "pip install aiohttp >= 3.7.4".
If upgrading is not an option for you, a workaround can be to avoid
using `aiohttp.web_middlewares.normalize_path_middleware` in your
applications.

The Java client for the Datadog API before version 1.0.0-beta.9 has a
local information disclosure of sensitive information downloaded via
the API using the API Client. The Datadog API is executed on a unix-
like system with multiple users. The API is used to download a file
containing sensitive information. This sensitive information is
exposed locally to other users. This vulnerability exists in the API
Client for version 1 and 2. The method `prepareDownloadFilecreates`
creates a temporary file with the permissions bits of `-rw-r--r--` on
unix-like systems. On unix-like systems, the system temporary
directory is shared between users. As such, the contents of the file
downloaded via the `downloadFileFromResponse` method will be visible
to all other users on the local system. Analysis of the finding
determined that the affected code was unused, meaning that the
exploitation likelihood is low. The unused code has been removed,
effectively mitigating this issue. This issue has been patched in
version 1.0.0-beta.9. As a workaround one may specify `java.io.tmpdir`
when starting the JVM with the flag `-Djava.io.tmpdir`, specifying a
path to a directory with `drw-------` permissions owned by `dd-agent`.

environment variables, you are not vulnerable to this issue. If you
are not launching multiple containers or Kubernetes pods from the same
image in rapid succession, you have reduced likelihood of being
vulnerable to this issue This vulnerability has been fixed in

Products.PluggableAuthService is a pluggable Zope authentication and
authorization framework. In Products.PluggableAuthService before
version 2.6.0 there is an open redirect vulnerability. A maliciously
crafted link to the login form and login functionality could redirect
the browser to a different website. The problem has been fixed in
version 2.6.1. Depending on how you have installed
Products.PluggableAuthService, you should change the buildout version
pin to `2.6.1` and re-run the buildout, or if you used `pip` simply do
`pip install "Products.PluggableAuthService>=2.6.1".

XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again.
In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is vulnerability which may
allow a remote attacker to allocate 100% CPU time on the target system
depending on CPU type or parallel execution of such a payload
resulting in a denial of service only by manipulating the processed
input stream. No user is affected who followed the recommendation to
setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the
minimal required types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of
the Security Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.

XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again.
In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability where the
processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to
recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new
instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate
the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result
in a server-side forgery request. No user is affected, who followed
the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with a
whitelist limited to the minimal required types. If you rely on
XStream's default blacklist of the Security Framework, you will have
to use at least version 1.4.16.

XStream is a Java library to serialize objects to XML and back again.
In XStream before version 1.4.16, there is a vulnerability which may
allow a remote attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a
remote host only by manipulating the processed input stream. No user
is affected, who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's
security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required
types. If you rely on XStream's default blacklist of the Security
Framework, you will have to use at least version 1.4.16.

Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking
application written in PHP. In TimeTracker before version 1.19.24.5415
tokens used in password reset feature in Time Tracker are based on
system time and, therefore, are predictable. This opens a window for
brute force attacks to guess user tokens and, once successful, change
user passwords, including that of a system administrator. This
vulnerability is pathced in version 1.19.24.5415 (started to use more
secure tokens) with an additional improvement in 1.19.24.5416 (limited
an available window for brute force token guessing).

Pug is an npm package which is a high-performance template engine. In
pug before version 3.0.1, if a remote attacker was able to control the
`pretty` option of the pug compiler, e.g. if you spread a user
provided object such as the query parameters of a request into the pug
template inputs, it was possible for them to achieve remote code
execution on the node.js backend. This is fixed in version 3.0.1. This
advisory applies to multiple pug packages including "pug", "pug-code-
gen". pug-code-gen has a backported fix at version 2.0.3. This
advisory is not exploitable if there is no way for un-trusted input to
be passed to pug as the `pretty` option, e.g. if you compile templates
in advance before applying user input to them, you do not need to
upgrade.

Pollbot is open source software which "frees its human masters from
the toilsome task of polling for the state of things during the
Firefox release process." In Pollbot before version 1.4.4 there is an
open redirection vulnerability in the path of
"https://pollbot.services.mozilla.com/". An attacker can redirect
anyone to malicious sites. To Reproduce type in this URL:
"https://pollbot.services.mozilla.com//evil.com/". Affected versions
will redirect to that website when you inject a payload like
"//evil.com/". This is fixed in version 1.4.4.

TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In
TYPO3 before versions 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1, due to the lack
of ensuring file extensions belong to configured allowed mime-types,
attackers can upload arbitrary data with arbitrary file extensions -
however, default _fileDenyPattern_ successfully blocked files like
_.htaccess_ or _malicious.php_. Besides that,
_UploadedFileReferenceConverter_ transforming uploaded files into
proper FileReference domain model objects handles possible file
uploads for other extensions as well - given those extensions use the
Extbase MVC framework, make use of FileReference items in their direct
or inherited domain model definitions and did not implement their own
type converter. In case this scenario applies,
_UploadedFileReferenceConverter_ accepts any file mime-type and
persists files in the default location. In any way, uploaded files are
placed in the default location _/fileadmin/user_upload/_, in most
scenarios keeping the submitted filename - which allows attackers to
directly reference files, or even correctly guess filenames used by
other individuals, disclosing this information. No authentication is
required to exploit this vulnerability. This is fixed in versions
8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1.

TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In
TYPO3 before versions 8.7.40, 9.5.25, 10.4.14, 11.1.1 due to improper
input validation, attackers can by-pass restrictions of predefined

swagger-codegen is an open-source project which contains a template-
driven engine to generate documentation, API clients and server stubs
in different languages by parsing your OpenAPI / Swagger definition.
In swagger-codegen before version 2.4.19, on Unix like systems, the
system's temporary directory is shared between all users on that
system. A collocated user can observe the process of creating a
temporary sub directory in the shared temporary directory and race to
complete the creation of the temporary subdirectory. This
vulnerability is local privilege escalation because the contents of
the `outputFolder` can be appended to by an attacker. As such, code
written to this directory, when executed can be attacker controlled.
For more details refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory.
This vulnerability is fixed in version 2.4.19. Note this is a distinct
vulnerability from CVE-2021-21364.

Switchboard Bluetooth Plug for elementary OS from version 2.3.0 and
before version version 2.3.5 has an incorrect authorization
vulnerability. When the Bluetooth plug is running (in discoverable
mode), Bluetooth service requests and pairing requests are
automatically accepted, allowing physically proximate attackers to
pair with a device running an affected version of switchboard-plug-
bluetooth without the active consent of the user. By default,
elementary OS doesn't expose any services via Bluetooth that allow
information to be extracted by paired Bluetooth devices. However, if
such services (i.e. contact list sharing software) have been
installed, it's possible that attackers have been able to extract data
from such services without authorization. If no such services have
been installed, attackers are only able to pair with a device running
an affected version without authorization and then play audio out of
the device or possibly present a HID device (keyboard, mouse, etc...)
to control the device. As such, users should check the list of
trusted/paired devices and remove any that are not 100% confirmed to
be genuine. This is fixed in version 2.3.5. To reduce the likelihood
of this vulnerability on an unpatched version, only open the Bluetooth
plug for short intervals when absolutely necessary and preferably not
in crowded public areas. To mitigate the risk entirely with unpatched
versions, do not open the Bluetooth plug within switchboard at all,
and use a different method for pairing devices if necessary (e.g.
`bluetoothctl` CLI).

msgpack5 is a msgpack v5 implementation for node.js and the browser.
In msgpack5 before versions 3.6.1, 4.5.1, and 5.2.1 there is a
"Prototype Poisoning" vulnerability. When msgpack5 decodes a map
containing a key "__proto__", it assigns the decoded value to
__proto__. Object.prototype.__proto__ is an accessor property for the
receiver's prototype. If the value corresponding to the key __proto__
decodes to an object or null, msgpack5 sets the decoded object's
prototype to that value. An attacker who can submit crafted
MessagePack data to a service can use this to produce values that
appear to be of other types; may have unexpected prototype properties
and methods (for example length, numeric properties, and push et al if
__proto__'s value decodes to an Array); and/or may throw unexpected
exceptions when used (for example if the __proto__ value decodes to a
Map or Date). Other unexpected behavior might be produced for other
types. There is no effect on the global prototype. This "prototype
poisoning" is sort of a very limited inversion of a prototype
pollution attack. Only the decoded value's prototype is affected, and
it can only be set to msgpack5 values (though if the victim makes use
of custom codecs, anything could be a msgpack5 value). We have not
found a way to escalate this to true prototype pollution (absent other
bugs in the consumer's code). This has been fixed in msgpack5 version
3.6.1, 4.5.1, and 5.2.1. See the referenced GitHub Security Advisory
for an example and more details.

Hyperledger Besu is an open-source, MainNet compatible, Ethereum
client written in Java. In Besu before version 1.5.1 there is a
denial-of-service vulnerability involving the HTTP JSON-RPC API
service. If username and password authentication is enabled for the
HTTP JSON-RPC API service, then prior to making any requests to an API
endpoint the requestor must use the login endpoint to obtain a JSON
web token (JWT) using their credentials. A single user can readily
overload the login endpoint with invalid requests (incorrect
password). As the supplied password is checked for validity on the
main vertx event loop and takes a relatively long time this can cause
the processing of other valid requests to fail. A valid username is
required for this vulnerability to be exposed. This has been fixed in
version 1.5.1.

Tenable for Jira Cloud is an open source project designed to pull
Tenable.io vulnerability data, then generate Jira Tasks and sub-tasks
based on the vulnerabilities' current state. It published in pypi as
"tenable-jira-cloud". In tenable-jira-cloud before version 1.1.21, it
is possible to run arbitrary commands through the yaml.load() method.
This could allow an attacker with local access to the host to run
arbitrary code by running the application with a specially crafted
YAML configuration file. This is fixed in version 1.1.21 by using
yaml.safe_load() instead of yaml.load().

Envoy is a cloud-native high-performance edge/middle/service proxy. In
Envoy version 1.17.0 an attacker can bypass authentication by
presenting a JWT token with an issuer that is not in the provider list
when Envoy's JWT Authentication filter is configured with the
`allow_missing` requirement under `requires_any` due to a mistake in
implementation. Envoy's JWT Authentication filter can be configured
with the `allow_missing` requirement that will be satisfied if JWT is
missing (JwtMissed error) and fail if JWT is presented or invalid. Due
to a mistake in implementation, a JwtUnknownIssuer error was
mistakenly converted to JwtMissed when `requires_any` was configured.
So if `allow_missing` was configured under `requires_any`, an attacker
can bypass authentication by presenting a JWT token with an issuer
that is not in the provider list. Integrity may be impacted depending
on configuration if the JWT token is used to protect against writes or
modifications. This regression was introduced on 2020/11/12 in PR
13839 which fixed handling `allow_missing` under RequiresAny in a
JwtRequirement (see issue 13458). The AnyVerifier aggregates the
children verifiers' results into a final status where JwtMissing is
the default error. However, a JwtUnknownIssuer was mistakenly treated
the same as a JwtMissing error and the resulting final aggregation was
the default JwtMissing. As a result, `allow_missing` would allow a JWT
token with an unknown issuer status. This is fixed in version 1.17.1
by PR 15194. The fix works by preferring JwtUnknownIssuer over a
JwtMissing error, fixing the accidental conversion and bypass with
`allow_missing`. A user could detect whether a bypass occurred if they
have Envoy logs enabled with debug verbosity. Users can enable
component level debug logs for JWT. The JWT filter logs will indicate
that there is a request with a JWT token and a failure that the JWT
token is missing.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services

Platform, the `{{wikimacrocontent}}` executes the content with the
rights of the wiki macro author instead of the caller of that wiki
macro. This makes possible to inject scripts through it and they will
be executed with the rights of the wiki macro (very often a user which
has Programming rights). Fortunately, no such macro exists by default
in XWiki Standard but one could have been created or installed with an
extension. This vulnerability has been patched in versions XWiki
12.6.3, 11.10.11 and 12.8-rc-1. There is no easy workaround other than
disabling the affected macros. Inserting content in a safe way or
knowing what is the user who called the wiki macro is not easy.

Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed
desktop applications on Linux. In Flatpack since version 0.9.4 and
before version 1.10.2 has a vulnerability in the "file forwarding"
feature which can be used by an attacker to gain access to files that
would not ordinarily be allowed by the app's permissions. By putting
the special tokens `@@` and/or `@@u` in the Exec field of a Flatpak
app's .desktop file, a malicious app publisher can trick flatpak into
behaving as though the user had chosen to open a target file with
their Flatpak app, which automatically makes that file available to
the Flatpak app. This is fixed in version 1.10.2. A minimal solution
is the first commit "`Disallow @@ and @@U usage in desktop files`".
The follow-up commits "`dir: Reserve the whole @@ prefix`" and "`dir:
Refuse to export .desktop files with suspicious uses of @@ tokens`"
are recommended, but not strictly required. As a workaround, avoid
installing Flatpak apps from untrusted sources, or check the contents
of the exported `.desktop` files in
`exports/share/applications/*.desktop` (typically
`~/.local/share/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop` and
`/var/lib/flatpak/exports/share/applications/*.desktop`) to make sure
that literal filenames do not follow `@@` or `@@u`.

Restund is an open source NAT traversal server. The restund TURN
server can be instructed to open a relay to the loopback address
range. This allows you to reach any other service running on localhost
which you might consider private. In the configuration that we ship
(https://github.com/wireapp/ansible-
restund/blob/master/templates/restund.conf.j2#L40-L43) the `status`
interface of restund is enabled and is listening on `127.0.0.1`.The
`status` interface allows users to issue administrative commands to
`restund` like listing open relays or draining connections. It would
be possible for an attacker to contact the status interface and issue
administrative commands by setting `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` to
`127.0.0.1:{{restund_udp_status_port}}` when opening a TURN channel.
We now explicitly disallow relaying to loopback addresses, 'any'
addresses, link local addresses, and the broadcast address. As a
workaround disable the `status` module in your restund configuration.
However there might still be other services running on `127.0.0.0/8`
that you do not want to have exposed. The `turn` module can be
disabled. Restund will still perform STUN and this might already be
enough for initiating calls in your environments. TURN is only used as
a last resort when other NAT traversal options do not work. One should
also make sure that the TURN server is set up with firewall rules so
that it cannot relay to other addresses that you don't want the TURN
server to relay to. For example other services in the same VPC where
the TURN server is running. Ideally TURN servers should be deployed in
an isolated fashion where they can only reach what they need to reach
to perform their task of assisting NAT-traversal.

Wiki.js an open-source wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js before
version 2.5.191 is vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through
mustache expressions in code blocks. This vulnerability exists due to
mustache expressions being parsed by Vue during content injection even
though it is contained within a `<pre>` element. By creating a crafted
wiki page, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site
scripting attack. This allows the attacker to execute malicious
JavaScript when the page is viewed by other users. For an example see
referenced GitHub Security Advisory. Commit
5ffa189383dd716f12b56b8cae2ba0d075996cf1 fixes this vulnerability by
adding the v-pre directive to all `<pre>` tags during the render.

Mifos-Mobile Android Application for MifosX is an Android Application
built on top of the MifosX Self-Service platform. Mifos-Mobile before
commit e505f62 disables HTTPS hostname verification of its HTTP
client. Additionally it accepted any self-signed certificate as valid.
Hostname verification is an important part when using HTTPS to ensure
that the presented certificate is valid for the host. Disabling it can
allow for man-in-the-middle attacks. Accepting any certificate, even
self-signed ones allows man-in-the-middle attacks. This problem is

Wrongthink peer-to-peer, end-to-end encrypted messenger with PeerJS
and Axolotl ratchet. In wrongthink from version 2.0.0 and before 2.3.0
there was a set of vulnerabilities causing inadequate encryption
strength. Part of the secret identity key was disclosed by the
fingerprint used for connection. Additionally, the safety number was
improperly calculated. It was computed using part of one of the public
identity keys instead of being derived from both public identity keys.
This caused issues in computing safety numbers which would potentially
be exploitable in the real world. Additionally there was inadequate
encryption strength due to use of 1024-bit DSA keys. These issues are
all fixed in version 2.3.0.

MinIO is an open-source high performance object storage service and it
is API compatible with Amazon S3 cloud storage service. In MinIO
before version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z, there is a vulnerability
which enables MITM modification of request bodies that are meant to
have integrity guaranteed by chunk signatures. In a PUT request using
aws-chunked encoding, MinIO ordinarily verifies signatures at the end
of a chunk. This check can be skipped if the client sends a false
chunk size that is much greater than the actual data sent: the server
accepts and completes the request without ever reaching the end of the
chunk + thereby without ever checking the chunk signature. This is
fixed in version RELEASE.2021-03-17T02-33-02Z. As a workaround one can
avoid using "aws-chunked" encoding-based chunk signature upload
requests instead use TLS. MinIO SDKs automatically disable chunked
encoding signature when the server endpoint is configured with TLS.

Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation in ansi C.
In Nanopb before versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5, decoding a specifically
formed message can cause invalid `free()` or `realloc()` calls if the
message type contains an `oneof` field, and the `oneof` directly
contains both a pointer field and a non-pointer field. If the message
data first contains the non-pointer field and then the pointer field,
the data of the non-pointer field is incorrectly treated as if it was
a pointer value. Such message data rarely occurs in normal messages,
but it is a concern when untrusted data is parsed. This has been fixed
in versions 0.3.9.8 and 0.4.5. See referenced GitHub Security Advisory
for more information including workarounds.

Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System. In Jellyfin before version
10.7.1, with certain endpoints, well crafted requests will allow
arbitrary file read from a Jellyfin server's file system. This issue
is more prevalent when Windows is used as the host OS. Servers that
are exposed to the public Internet are potentially at risk. This is
fixed in version 10.7.1. As a workaround, users may be able to
restrict some access by enforcing strict security permissions on their
filesystem, however, it is recommended to update as soon as possible.

Syncthing is a continuous file synchronization program. In Syncthing
before version 1.15.0, the relay server `strelaysrv` can be caused to
crash and exit by sending a relay message with a negative length
field. Similarly, Syncthing itself can crash for the same reason if
given a malformed message from a malicious relay server when
attempting to join the relay. Relay joins are essentially random (from
a subset of low latency relays) and Syncthing will by default restart
when crashing, at which point it's likely to pick another non-
malicious relay. This flaw is fixed in version 1.15.0.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393

Lotus is an Implementation of the Filecoin protocol written in Go. BLS
signature validation in lotus uses blst library method
VerifyCompressed. This method accepts signatures in 2 forms:
"serialized", and "compressed", meaning that BLS signatures can be
provided as either of 2 unique byte arrays. Lotus block validation
functions perform a uniqueness check on provided blocks. Two blocks
are considered distinct if the CIDs of their blockheader do not match.
The CID method for blockheader includes the BlockSig of the block. The
result of these issues is that it would be possible to punish miners
for valid blocks, as there are two different valid block CIDs
available for each block, even though this must be unique. By
switching from the go based `blst` bindings over to the bindings in
`filecoin-ffi`, the code paths now ensure that all signatures are
compressed by size and the way they are deserialized. This happened in
https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus/pull/5393.

Netty is an open-source, asynchronous event-driven network application
framework for rapid development of maintainable high performance
protocol servers & clients. In Netty (io.netty:netty-codec-http2)
before version 4.1.61.Final there is a vulnerability that enables
request smuggling. The content-length header is not correctly
validated if the request only uses a single Http2HeaderFrame with the
endStream set to to true. This could lead to request smuggling if the
request is proxied to a remote peer and translated to HTTP/1.1. This
is a followup of GHSA-wm47-8v5p-wjpj/CVE-2021-21295 which did miss to
fix this one case. This was fixed as part of 4.1.61.Final.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
Next-Generation IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read can be triggered by
6LoWPAN packets sent to devices running Contiki-NG 4.6 and prior. The
IPv6 header decompression function (<code>uncompress_hdr_iphc</code>)
does not perform proper boundary checks when reading from the packet
buffer. Hence, it is possible to construct a compressed 6LoWPAN packet
that will read more bytes than what is available from the packet
buffer. As of time of publication, there is not a release with a patch
available. Users can apply the patch for this vulnerability out-of-
band as a workaround.

OAuth2-Proxy is an open source reverse proxy that provides
authentication with Google, Github or other providers. The `--gitlab-
group` flag for group-based authorization in the GitLab provider
stopped working in the v7.0.0 release. Regardless of the flag
settings, authorization wasn't restricted. Additionally, any
authenticated users had whichever groups were set in `--gitlab-group`
added to the new `X-Forwarded-Groups` header to the upstream
application. While adding GitLab project based authorization support
in #630, a bug was introduced where the user session's groups field
was populated with the `--gitlab-group` config entries instead of
pulling the individual user's group membership from the GitLab
Userinfo endpoint. When the session groups where compared against the
allowed groups for authorization, they matched improperly (since both
lists were populated with the same data) so authorization was allowed.
This impacts GitLab Provider users who relies on group membership for
authorization restrictions. Any authenticated users in your GitLab
environment can access your applications regardless of `--gitlab-
group` membership restrictions. This is patched in v7.1.0. There is no
workaround for the Group membership bug. But `--gitlab-project` can be
set to use Project membership as the authorization checks instead of
groups; it is not broken.

isolated-vm is a library for nodejs which gives you access to v8's
Isolate interface. Versions of isolated-vm before v4.0.0 have API
pitfalls which may make it easy for implementers to expose supposed
secure isolates to the permissions of the main nodejs isolate.
Reference objects allow access to the underlying reference's full
prototype chain. In an environment where the implementer has exposed a
Reference instance to an attacker they would be able to use it to
acquire a Reference to the nodejs context's Function object. Similar
application-specific attacks could be possible by modifying the local
prototype of other API objects. Access to NativeModule objects could
allow an attacker to load and run native code from anywhere on the
filesystem. If combined with, for example, a file upload API this
would allow for arbitrary code execution. This is addressed in v4.0.0
through a series of related changes.

Prisma VS Code a VSCode extension for Prisma schema files. This is a
Remote Code Execution Vulnerability that affects all versions of the
Prisma VS Code extension older than 2.20.0. If a custom binary path
for the Prisma format binary is set in VS Code Settings, for example
by downloading a project that has a .vscode/settings.json file that
sets a value for "prismaFmtBinPath". That custom binary is executed
when auto-formatting is triggered by VS Code or when validation checks
are triggered after each keypress on a *.prisma file. Fixed in
versions 2.20.0 and 20.0.27. As a workaround users can either edit or
delete the `.vscode/settings.json` file or check if the binary is
malicious and delete it.

django-registration is a user registration package for Django. The
django-registration package provides tools for implementing user-
account registration flows in the Django web framework. In django-
registration prior to 3.1.2, the base user-account registration view
did not properly apply filters to sensitive data, with the result that
sensitive data could be included in error reports rather than removed
automatically by Django. Triggering this requires: A site is using
django-registration < 3.1.2, The site has detailed error reports (such
as Django's emailed error reports to site staff/developers) enabled
and a server-side error (HTTP 5xx) occurs during an attempt by a user
to register an account. Under these conditions, recipients of the
detailed error report will see all submitted data from the account-
registration attempt, which may include the user's proposed
credentials (such as a password).

Eventlet is a concurrent networking library for Python. A websocket
peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side by sending very large
websocket frames. Malicious peer may exhaust memory on Eventlet side
by sending highly compressed data frame. A patch in version 0.31.0
restricts websocket frame to reasonable limits. As a workaround,
restricting memory usage via OS limits would help against overall
machine exhaustion, but there is no workaround to protect Eventlet
process.

mongo-express is a web-based MongoDB admin interface, written with
Node.js and express. 1: As mentioned in this issue:
https://github.com/mongo-express/mongo-express/issues/577, when the
content of a cell grows larger than supported size, clicking on a row
will show full document unescaped, however this needs admin
interaction on cell. 2: Data cells identified as media will be
rendered as media, without being sanitized. Example of different
renders: image, audio, video, etc. As an example of type 1 attack, an
unauthorized user who only can send a large amount of data in a field
of a document may use a payload with embedded javascript. This could
send an export of a collection to the attacker without even an admin
knowing. Other types of attacks such as dropping a database\collection
are possible.

`projen` is a project generation tool that synthesizes project
configuration files such as `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`,
`.gitignore`, GitHub Workflows, `eslint`, `jest`, and more, from a
well-typed definition written in JavaScript. Users of projen's
`NodeProject` project type (including any project type derived from
it) include a `.github/workflows/rebuild-bot.yml` workflow that may
allow any GitHub user to trigger execution of un-trusted code in the
context of the "main" repository (as opposed to that of a fork). In
some situations, such untrusted code may potentially be able to commit
to the "main" repository. The rebuild-bot workflow is triggered by
comments including `@projen rebuild` on pull-request to trigger a re-
build of the projen project, and updating the pull request with the
updated files. This workflow is triggered by an `issue_comment` event,
and thus always executes with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the
repository into which the pull-request is made (this is in contrast
with workflows triggered by `pull_request` events, which always
execute with a `GITHUB_TOKEN` belonging to the repository from which
the pull-request is made). Repositories that do not have branch
protection configured on their default branch (typically `main` or
`master`) could possibly allow an untrusted user to gain access to
secrets configured on the repository (such as NPM tokens, etc). Branch
protection prohibits this escalation, as the managed `GITHUB_TOKEN`
would not be able to modify the contents of a protected branch and
affected workflows must be defined on the default branch.

Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
of reusable PHP components. The ability to enumerate users was
possible without relevant permissions due to different handling
depending on whether the user existed or not when attempting to use
the switch users functionality. We now ensure that 403s are returned
whether the user exists or not if a user cannot switch to a user or if
the user does not exist. The patch for this issue is available for

Grav Admin Plugin is an HTML user interface that provides a way to
configure Grav and create and modify pages. In versions 1.10.7 and
earlier, an unauthenticated user can execute some methods of
administrator controller without needing any credentials. Particular
method execution will result in arbitrary YAML file creation or
content change of existing YAML files on the system. Successfully
exploitation of that vulnerability results in configuration changes,
such as general site information change, custom scheduler job
definition, etc. Due to the nature of the vulnerability, an adversary
can change some part of the webpage, or hijack an administrator
account, or execute operating system command under the context of the
web-server user. This vulnerability is fixed in version 1.10.8.
Blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted sources can be
applied as a workaround.

SAP MII allows users to create dashboards and save them as JSP through
the SSCE (Self Service Composition Environment). An attacker can
intercept a request to the server, inject malicious JSP code in the
request and forward to server. When this dashboard is opened by users
having at least SAP_XMII Developer role, malicious content in the
dashboard gets executed, leading to remote code execution in the
server, which allows privilege escalation. The malicious JSP code can
contain certain OS commands, through which an attacker can read
sensitive files in the server, modify files or even delete contents in
the server thus compromising the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of the server hosting the SAP MII application. Also, an
attacker authenticated as a developer can use the application to
upload and execute a file which will permit them to execute operating
systems commands completely compromising the server hosting the
application.

Reference: URL:https://blog.installbuilder.com/2021/10/installbuilder-2160-released.html

Under certain circumstances, when manipulating the Windows registry,
InstallBuilder uses the reg.exe system command. The full path to the
command is not enforced, which results in a search in the search path
until a binary can be identified. This makes the installer/uninstaller
vulnerable to Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking, potentially
allowing an attacker to plant a malicious reg.exe command so it takes
precedence over the system command. The vulnerability only affects
Windows installers.

On Windows, the uninstaller binary copies itself to a fixed temporary
location, which is then executed (the originally called uninstaller
exits, so it does not block the installation directory). This
temporary location is not randomized and does not restrict access to
Administrators only so a potential attacker could plant a binary to
replace the copied binary right before it gets called, thus gaining
Administrator privileges (if the original uninstaller was executed as
Administrator). The vulnerability only affects Windows installers.

Spring Security 5.4.x prior to 5.4.4, 5.3.x prior to 5.3.8.RELEASE,
5.2.x prior to 5.2.9.RELEASE, and older unsupported versions can fail
to save the SecurityContext if it is changed more than once in a
single request.A malicious user cannot cause the bug to happen (it
must be programmed in). However, if the application's intent is to
only allow the user to run with elevated privileges in a small portion
of the application, the bug can be leveraged to extend those
privileges to the rest of the application.
