Element Android is an Android Matrix Client. Element Android version
1.4.3 through 1.6.10 is vulnerable to intent redirection, allowing a
third-party malicious application to start any internal activity by
passing some extra parameters. Possible impact includes making Element
Android display an arbitrary web page, executing arbitrary JavaScript;
bypassing PIN code protection; and account takeover by spawning a
login screen to send credentials to an arbitrary home server. This
issue is fixed in Element Android 1.6.12. There is no known workaround
to mitigate the issue.

Element Android is an Android Matrix Client. A third-party malicious
application installed on the same phone can force Element Android,
version 0.91.0 through 1.6.12, to share files stored under the `files`
directory in the application's private data directory to an arbitrary
room. The impact of the attack is reduced by the fact that the
databases stored in this folder are encrypted. However, it contains
some other potentially sensitive information, such as the FCM token.
Forks of Element Android which have set `android:exported="false"` in
the `AndroidManifest.xml` file for the `IncomingShareActivity`
activity are not impacted. This issue is fixed in Element Android
1.6.12. There is no known workaround to mitigate the issue.

EventStoreDB (ESDB) is an operational database built to store events.
A vulnerability has been identified in the projections subsystem in
versions 20 prior to 20.10.6, 21 prior to 21.10.11, 22 prior to
22.10.5, and 23 prior to 23.10.1. Only database instances that use
custom projections are affected by this vulnerability. User passwords
may become accessible to those who have access to the chunk files on
disk, and users who have read access to system streams. Only users in
the `$admins` group can access system streams by default. ESDB
23.10.1, 22.10.5, 21.10.11, and 20.10.6 contain a patch for this
issue. Users should upgrade EventStoreDB, reset the passwords for
current and previous members of `$admins` and `$ops` groups, and, if a
password was reused in any other system, reset it in those systems to
a unique password to follow best practices. If an upgrade cannot be
done immediately, reset the passwords for current and previous members
of `$admins` and `$ops` groups. Avoid creating custom projections
until the patch has been applied.

MeshCentral is a full computer management web site. Versions prior to
1.1.21 a cross-site websocket hijacking (CSWSH) vulnerability within
the control.ashx endpoint. This component is the primary mechanism
used within MeshCentral to perform administrative actions on the
server. The vulnerability is exploitable when an attacker is able to
convince a victim end-user to click on a malicious link to a page
hosting an attacker-controlled site. The attacker can then originate a
cross-site websocket connection using client-side JavaScript code to
connect to `control.ashx` as the victim user within MeshCentral.
Version 1.1.21 contains a patch for this issue.

The XWiki licensor application, which manages and enforce application
licenses for paid extensions, includes the document
`Licenses.Code.LicenseJSON` that provides information for admins
regarding active licenses. This document is public and thus exposes
this information publicly. The information includes the instance's id
as well as first and last name and email of the license owner. This is
a leak of information that isn't supposed to be public. The instance
id allows associating data on the active installs data with the
concrete XWiki instance. Active installs assures that "there's no way
to find who's having a given UUID" (referring to the instance id).
Further, the information who the license owner is and information
about the obtained licenses can be used for targeted phishing attacks.
Also, while user information is normally public, email addresses might
only be displayed obfuscated, depending on the configuration. This has
been fixed in Application Licensing 1.24.2. There are no known

Rack is a modular Ruby web server interface. Carefully crafted Range
headers can cause a server to respond with an unexpectedly large
response. Responding with such large responses could lead to a denial
of service issue. Vulnerable applications will use the `Rack::File`
middleware or the `Rack::Utils.byte_ranges` methods (this includes
Rails applications). The vulnerability is fixed in 3.0.9.1 and
2.2.8.1.

Helm is a package manager for Charts for Kubernetes. Versions prior to
3.14.2 contain an uninitialized variable vulnerability when Helm
parses index and plugin yaml files missing expected content. When
either an `index.yaml` file or a plugins `plugin.yaml` file were
missing all metadata a panic would occur in Helm. In the Helm SDK,
this is found when using the `LoadIndexFile` or `DownloadIndexFile`
functions in the `repo` package or the `LoadDir` function in the
`plugin` package. For the Helm client this impacts functions around
adding a repository and all Helm functions if a malicious plugin is
added as Helm inspects all known plugins on each invocation. This
issue has been resolved in Helm v3.14.2. If a malicious plugin has
been added which is causing all Helm client commands to panic, the
malicious plugin can be manually removed from the filesystem. If using
Helm SDK versions prior to 3.14.2, calls to affected functions can use
`recover` to catch the panic.

Querybook is a user interface for querying big data. Prior to version
3.31.1, there is a vulnerability in Querybook's rich text editor that
enables users to input arbitrary URLs without undergoing necessary
validation. This particular security flaw allows the use of
`javascript:` protocol which can potentially trigger arbitrary client-
side execution. The most extreme exploit of this flaw could occur when
an admin user unknowingly clicks on a cross-site scripting URL,
thereby unintentionally compromising admin role access to the
attacker. A patch to rectify this issue has been introduced in
Querybook version `3.31.1`. The fix is backward compatible and
automatically fixes existing DataDocs. There are no known workarounds
for this issue, except for manually checking each URL prior to
clicking on them.

Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual
machine. If an excessively large value is specified as the starting
index for an array in `_abi_decode`, it can cause the read position to

array bounds, potentially leading to exploitations in contracts that
use arrays within `_abi_decode`. This vulnerability affects 0.3.10 and

`@backstage/backend-common` is a common functionality library for
backends for Backstage, an open platform for building developer
portals. In `@backstage/backend-common` prior to versions 0.21.1,
0.20.2, and 0.19.10, paths checks with the `resolveSafeChildPath`
utility were not exhaustive enough, leading to risk of path traversal
vulnerabilities if symlinks can be injected by attackers. This issue

The `mjml` PyPI package, found at the `FelixSchwarz/mjml-python`
GitHub repo, is an unofficial Python port of MJML, a markup language
created by Mailjet. All users of `FelixSchwarz/mjml-python` who insert
untrusted data into mjml templates unless that data is checked in a
very strict manner. User input like `&lt;script&gt;` would be rendered
as `<script>` in the final HTML output. The attacker must be able to
control some data which is later injected in an mjml template which is
then send out as email to other users. The attacker could control
contents of email messages sent through the platform. The problem has
been fixed in version 0.11.0 of this library. Versions before 0.10.0
are not affected by this security issue. As a workaround, ensure that
potentially untrusted user input does not contain any sequences which
could be rendered as HTML.

Apache Airflow, versions before 2.8.2, has a vulnerability that allows
authenticated Ops and Viewers users to view all information on audit
logs, including dag names and usernames they were not permitted to
view. With 2.8.2 and newer, Ops and Viewer users do not have audit log
permission by default, they need to be explicitly granted permissions
to see the logs. Only admin users have audit log permission by
default. Users of Apache Airflow are recommended to upgrade to version
2.8.2 or newer to mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/22/3

Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper
Synchronization ('Race Condition') vulnerability in Apache Answer.This
issue affects Apache Answer: through 1.2.1. Repeated submission during
registration resulted in the registration of the same user. When users
register, if they rapidly submit multiple registrations using scripts,
it can result in the creation of multiple user accounts simultaneously
with the same name. Users are recommended to upgrade to version
[1.2.5], which fixes the issue.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net: tls: fix use-after-free with partial reads and async decrypt
tls_decrypt_sg doesn't take a reference on the pages from clear_skb,
so the put_page() in tls_decrypt_done releases them, and we trigger a
use-after-free in process_rx_list when we try to read from the
partially-read skb.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
tls: fix race between async notify and socket close The submitting
thread (one which called recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as soon as the
async crypto handler calls complete() so any code past that point
risks touching already freed data. Try to avoid the locking and extra
flags altogether. Have the main thread hold an extra reference, this
way we can depend solely on the atomic ref counter for
synchronization. Don't futz with reiniting the completion, either, we
are now tightly controlling when completion fires.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net: tls: handle backlogging of crypto requests Since we're setting
the CRYPTO_TFM_REQ_MAY_BACKLOG flag on our requests to the crypto API,
crypto_aead_{encrypt,decrypt} can return -EBUSY instead of
-EINPROGRESS in valid situations. For example, when the cryptd queue
for AESNI is full (easy to trigger with an artificially low
cryptd.cryptd_max_cpu_qlen), requests will be enqueued to the backlog
but still processed. In that case, the async callback will also be
called twice: first with err == -EINPROGRESS, which it seems we can
just ignore, then with err == 0. Compared to Sabrina's original patch
this version uses the new tls_*crypt_async_wait() helpers and converts
the EBUSY to EINPROGRESS to avoid having to modify all the error
handling paths. The handling is identical.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
tls: fix race between tx work scheduling and socket close Similarly to
previous commit, the submitting thread (recvmsg/sendmsg) may exit as
soon as the async crypto handler calls complete(). Reorder scheduling
the work before calling complete(). This seems more logical in the
first place, as it's the inverse order of what the submitting thread
will do.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix stack corruption When tc filters are
first added to a net device, the corresponding local port gets bound
to an ACL group in the device. The group contains a list of ACLs. In
turn, each ACL points to a different TCAM region where the filters are
stored. During forwarding, the ACLs are sequentially evaluated until a
match is found. One reason to place filters in different regions is
when they are added with decreasing priorities and in an alternating
order so that two consecutive filters can never fit in the same region
because of their key usage. In Spectrum-2 and newer ASICs the firmware
started to report that the maximum number of ACLs in a group is more
than 16, but the layout of the register that configures ACL groups
(PAGT) was not updated to account for that. It is therefore possible
to hit stack corruption [1] in the rare case where more than 16 ACLs
in a group are required. Fix by limiting the maximum ACL group size to
the minimum between what the firmware reports and the maximum ACLs
that fit in the PAGT register. Add a test case to make sure the
machine does not crash when this condition is hit. [1] Kernel panic -
not syncing: stack-protector: Kernel stack is corrupted in:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
erofs: fix inconsistent per-file compression format EROFS can select
compression algorithms on a per-file basis, and each per-file
compression algorithm needs to be marked in the on-disk superblock for
initialization. However, syzkaller can generate inconsistent crafted
images that use an unsupported algorithmtype for specific inodes, e.g.
use MicroLZMA algorithmtype even it's not set in
`sbi->available_compr_algs`. This can lead to an unexpected "BUG:
kernel NULL pointer dereference" if the corresponding decompressor
isn't built-in. Fix this by checking against
`sbi->available_compr_algs` for each m_algorithmformat request.
Incorrect !erofs_sb_has_compr_cfgs preset bitmap is now fixed together
since it was harmless previously.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net: dsa: fix netdev_priv() dereference before check on non-DSA
netdevice events After the blamed commit, we started doing this
dereference for every NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER and NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER
event in the system. static inline struct dsa_port
*dsa_user_to_port(const struct net_device *dev) { struct dsa_user_priv
*p = netdev_priv(dev); return p->dp; } Which is obviously bogus,
because not all net_devices have a netdev_priv() of type struct
dsa_user_priv. But struct dsa_user_priv is fairly small, and p->dp
means dereferencing 8 bytes starting with offset 16. Most drivers
allocate that much private memory anyway, making our access not fault,
and we discard the bogus data quickly afterwards, so this wasn't
caught. But the dummy interface is somewhat special in that it calls
alloc_netdev() with a priv size of 0. So every netdev_priv()
dereference is invalid, and we get this when we emit a
NETDEV_PRECHANGEUPPER event with a VLAN as its new upper: $ ip link
add dummy1 type dummy $ ip link add link dummy1 name dummy1.100 type
vlan id 100 [ 43.309174]

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Avoid potential UAF in LPI translation cache
There is a potential UAF scenario in the case of an LPI translation
cache hit racing with an operation that invalidates the cache, such as
a DISCARD ITS command. The root of the problem is that
vgic_its_check_cache() does not elevate the refcount on the vgic_irq
before dropping the lock that serializes refcount changes. Have
vgic_its_check_cache() raise the refcount on the returned vgic_irq and
add the corresponding decrement after queueing the interrupt.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ext4: regenerate buddy after block freeing failed if under fc replay
This mostly reverts commit 6bd97bf273bd ("ext4: remove redundant
mb_regenerate_buddy()") and reintroduces mb_regenerate_buddy(). Based
on code in mb_free_blocks(), fast commit replay can end up marking as
free blocks that are already marked as such. This causes corruption of
the buddy bitmap so we need to regenerate it in that case.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
sched/membarrier: reduce the ability to hammer on sys_membarrier On
some systems, sys_membarrier can be very expensive, causing overall
slowdowns for everything. So put a lock on the path in order to
serialize the accesses to prevent the ability for this to be called at
too high of a frequency and saturate the machine.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
x86/fpu: Stop relying on userspace for info to fault in xsave buffer
Before this change, the expected size of the user space buffer was
taken from fx_sw->xstate_size. fx_sw->xstate_size can be changed from
user-space, so it is possible construct a sigreturn frame where: *
fx_sw->xstate_size is smaller than the size required by valid bits in
fx_sw->xfeatures. * user-space unmaps parts of the sigrame fpu buffer
so that not all of the buffer required by xrstor is accessible. In
this case, xrstor tries to restore and accesses the unmapped area
which results in a fault. But fault_in_readable succeeds because buf +
fx_sw->xstate_size is within the still mapped area, so it goes back
and tries xrstor again. It will spin in this loop forever. Instead,
fault in the maximum size which can be touched by XRSTOR (taken from
fpstate->user_size). [ dhansen: tweak subject / changelog ]

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
binder: signal epoll threads of self-work In (e)poll mode, threads
often depend on I/O events to determine when data is ready for
consumption. Within binder, a thread may initiate a command via
BINDER_WRITE_READ without a read buffer and then make use of
epoll_wait() or similar to consume any responses afterwards. It is
then crucial that epoll threads are signaled via wakeup when they
queue their own work. Otherwise, they risk waiting indefinitely for an
event leaving their work unhandled. What is worse, subsequent commands
won't trigger a wakeup either as the thread has pending work.

The issue here is as follows: - tidss probes, but is deferred as
sii902x is still missing. - sii902x starts probing and enters
sii902x_init(). - sii902x calls drm_bridge_add(). Now the sii902x
bridge is ready from DRM's perspective. - sii902x calls
sii902x_audio_codec_init() and platform_device_register_data() - The
registration of the audio platform device causes probing of the
deferred devices. - tidss probes, which eventually causes
sii902x_bridge_get_edid() to be called. - sii902x_bridge_get_edid()
tries to use the i2c to read the edid. However, the sii902x driver has
not set up the i2c part yet, leading to the crash. Fix this by moving
the drm_bridge_add() to the end of the sii902x_init(), which is also
at the very end of sii902x_probe().

is possible that the connection is in process of being established

0033:0x7f47e5e0952b - Crash, mostly due to above use-after-free
[CAUSE] The converted fs has the following data chunk layout: item 2
key (FIRST_CHUNK_TREE CHUNK_ITEM 2214658048) itemoff 16025 itemsize 80
length 86016 owner 2 stripe_len 65536 type DATA|single For above
logical bytenr 2214744064, it's at the chunk end (2214658048 + 86016 =
2214744064). This means btrfs_submit_bio() would split the bio, and
trigger endio function for both of the two halves. However
scrub_submit_initial_read() would only expect the endio function to be
called once, not any more. This means the first endio function would
already free the bbio::bio, leaving the bvec freed, thus the 2nd endio
call would lead to use-after-free. [FIX] - Make sure
scrub_read_endio() only updates bits in its range Since we may read
less than 64K at the end of the chunk, we should not touch the bits
beyond chunk boundary. - Make sure scrub_submit_initial_read() only to
read the chunk range This is done by calculating the real number of
sectors we need to read, and add sector-by-sector to the bio.
Thankfully the scrub read repair path won't need extra fixes: -
scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() With above fixes, we won't update
error bit for range beyond chunk, thus
scrub_stripe_submit_repair_read() should never submit any read beyond
the chunk.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
arm64/sme: Always exit sme_alloc() early with existing storage When
sme_alloc() is called with existing storage and we are not flushing we
will always allocate new storage, both leaking the existing storage
and corrupting the state. Fix this by separating the checks for
flushing and for existing storage as we do for SVE. Callers that
reallocate (eg, due to changing the vector length) should call
sme_free() themselves.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
s390/vfio-ap: always filter entire AP matrix The
vfio_ap_mdev_filter_matrix function is called whenever a new adapter
or domain is assigned to the mdev. The purpose of the function is to
update the guest's AP configuration by filtering the matrix of
adapters and domains assigned to the mdev. When an adapter or domain
is assigned, only the APQNs associated with the APID of the new
adapter or APQI of the new domain are inspected. If an APQN does not
reference a queue device bound to the vfio_ap device driver, then it's
APID will be filtered from the mdev's matrix when updating the guest's
AP configuration. Inspecting only the APID of the new adapter or APQI
of the new domain will result in passing AP queues through to a guest
that are not bound to the vfio_ap device driver under certain
circumstances. Consider the following: guest's AP configuration (all
also assigned to the mdev's matrix): 14.0004 14.0005 14.0006 16.0004
16.0005 16.0006 unassign domain 4 unbind queue 16.0005 assign domain 4
When domain 4 is re-assigned, since only domain 4 will be inspected,
the APQNs that will be examined will be: 14.0004 16.0004 Since both of
those APQNs reference queue devices that are bound to the vfio_ap
device driver, nothing will get filtered from the mdev's matrix when
updating the guest's AP configuration. Consequently, queue 16.0005
will get passed through despite not being bound to the driver. This
violates the linux device model requirement that a guest shall only be
given access to devices bound to the device driver facilitating their
pass-through. To resolve this problem, every adapter and domain
assigned to the mdev will be inspected when filtering the mdev's
matrix.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
pds_core: Prevent race issues involving the adminq There are multiple
paths that can result in using the pdsc's adminq. [1] pdsc_adminq_isr
and the resulting work from queue_work(), i.e.
pdsc_work_thread()->pdsc_process_adminq() [2] pdsc_adminq_post() When
the device goes through reset via PCIe reset and/or a fw_down/fw_up
cycle due to bad PCIe state or bad device state the adminq is
destroyed and recreated. A NULL pointer dereference can happen if [1]
or [2] happens after the adminq is already destroyed. In order to fix
this, add some further state checks and implement reference counting
for adminq uses. Reference counting was used because multiple threads
can attempt to access the adminq at the same time via [1] or [2].
Additionally, multiple clients (i.e. pds-vfio-pci) can be using [2] at
the same time. The adminq_refcnt is initialized to 1 when the adminq
has been allocated and is ready to use. Users/clients of the adminq
(i.e. [1] and [2]) will increment the refcnt when they are using the
adminq. When the driver goes into a fw_down cycle it will set the
PDSC_S_FW_DEAD bit and then wait for the adminq_refcnt to hit 1.
Setting the PDSC_S_FW_DEAD before waiting will prevent any further
adminq_refcnt increments. Waiting for the adminq_refcnt to hit 1
allows for any current users of the adminq to finish before the driver
frees the adminq. Once the adminq_refcnt hits 1 the driver clears the
refcnt to signify that the adminq is deleted and cannot be used. On
the fw_up cycle the driver will once again initialize the
adminq_refcnt to 1 allowing the adminq to be used again.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
af_unix: fix lockdep positive in sk_diag_dump_icons() syzbot reported
a lockdep splat [1]. Blamed commit hinted about the possible lockdep
violation, and code used unix_state_lock_nested() in an attempt to
silence lockdep. It is not sufficient, because
unix_state_lock_nested() is already used from
unix_state_double_lock(). We need to use a separate subclass. This
patch adds a distinct enumeration to make things more explicit. Also
use swap() in unix_state_double_lock() as a clean up. v2: add a
missing inline keyword to unix_state_lock_nested() [1] WARNING:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
llc: call sock_orphan() at release time syzbot reported an interesting
trace [1] caused by a stale sk->sk_wq pointer in a closed llc socket.
In commit ff7b11aa481f ("net: socket: set sock->sk to NULL after
calling proto_ops::release()") Eric Biggers hinted that some protocols
are missing a sock_orphan(), we need to perform a full audit. In net-
next, I plan to clear sock->sk from sock_orphan() and amend Eric patch
to add a warning. [1] BUG: KASAN: slab-use-after-free in list_empty

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
scsi: core: Move scsi_host_busy() out of host lock for waking up EH
handler Inside scsi_eh_wakeup(), scsi_host_busy() is called & checked
with host lock every time for deciding if error handler kthread needs
to be waken up. This can be too heavy in case of recovery, such as: -
N hardware queues - queue depth is M for each hardware queue - each
scsi_host_busy() iterates over (N * M) tag/requests If recovery is
triggered in case that all requests are in-flight, each
scsi_eh_wakeup() is strictly serialized, when scsi_eh_wakeup() is
called for the last in-flight request, scsi_host_busy() has been run
for (N * M - 1) times, and request has been iterated for (N*M - 1) *
(N * M) times. If both N and M are big enough, hard lockup can be
triggered on acquiring host lock, and it is observed on mpi3mr(128 hw
queues, queue depth 8169). Fix the issue by calling scsi_host_busy()
outside the host lock. We don't need the host lock for getting busy
count because host the lock never covers that. [mkp: Drop unnecessary
'busy' variables pointed out by Bart]

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
nfsd: fix RELEASE_LOCKOWNER The test on so_count in
nfsd4_release_lockowner() is nonsense and harmful. Revert to using
check_for_locks(), changing that to not sleep. First: harmful. As is
documented in the kdoc comment for nfsd4_release_lockowner(), the test
on so_count can transiently return a false positive resulting in a
return of NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD when in fact no locks are held. This is
clearly a protocol violation and with the Linux NFS client it can
cause incorrect behaviour. If RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is sent while some
other thread is still processing a LOCK request which failed because,
at the time that request was received, the given owner held a
conflicting lock, then the nfsd thread processing that LOCK request
can hold a reference (conflock) to the lock owner that causes
nfsd4_release_lockowner() to return an incorrect error. The Linux NFS
client ignores that NFS4ERR_LOCKS_HELD error because it never sends
NFS4_RELEASE_LOCKOWNER without first releasing any locks, so it knows
that the error is impossible. It assumes the lock owner was in fact
released so it feels free to use the same lock owner identifier in
some later locking request. When it does reuse a lock owner identifier
for which a previous RELEASE failed, it will naturally use a
lock_seqid of zero. However the server, which didn't release the lock
owner, will expect a larger lock_seqid and so will respond with
NFS4ERR_BAD_SEQID. So clearly it is harmful to allow a false positive,
which testing so_count allows. The test is nonsense because ...
well... it doesn't mean anything. so_count is the sum of three
different counts. 1/ the set of states listed on so_stateids 2/ the
set of active vfs locks owned by any of those states 3/ various
transient counts such as for conflicting locks. When it is tested
against '2' it is clear that one of these is the transient reference
obtained by find_lockowner_str_locked(). It is not clear what the
other one is expected to be. In practice, the count is often 2 because
there is precisely one state on so_stateids. If there were more, this
would fail. In my testing I see two circumstances when
RELEASE_LOCKOWNER is called. In one case, CLOSE is called before
RELEASE_LOCKOWNER. That results in all the lock states being removed,
and so the lockowner being discarded (it is removed when there are no
more references which usually happens when the lock state is
discarded). When nfsd4_release_lockowner() finds that the lock owner
doesn't exist, it returns success. The other case shows an so_count of
'2' and precisely one state listed in so_stateid. It appears that the
Linux client uses a separate lock owner for each file resulting in one
lock state per lock owner, so this test on '2' is safe. For another
client it might not be safe. So this patch changes check_for_locks()
to use the (newish) find_any_file_locked() so that it doesn't take a
reference on the nfs4_file and so never calls nfsd_file_put(), and so
never sleeps. With this check is it safe to restore the use of
check_for_locks() rather than testing so_count against the mysterious
'2'.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
mm: cachestat: fix folio read-after-free in cache walk In cachestat,
we access the folio from the page cache's xarray to compute its page
offset, and check for its dirty and writeback flags. However, we do
not hold a reference to the folio before performing these actions,
which means the folio can concurrently be released and reused as
another folio/page/slab. Get around this altogether by just using
xarray's existing machinery for the folio page offsets and
dirty/writeback states. This changes behavior for tmpfs files to now
always report zeroes in their dirty and writeback counters. This is
okay as tmpfs doesn't follow conventional writeback cache behavior:
its pages get "cleaned" during swapout, after which they're no longer
resident etc.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
llc: Drop support for ETH_P_TR_802_2. syzbot reported an uninit-value
bug below. [0] llc supports ETH_P_802_2 (0x0004) and used to support
ETH_P_TR_802_2 (0x0011), and syzbot abused the latter to trigger the
bug. write$tun(r0, &(0x7f0000000040)={@val={0x0, 0x11}, @val,
@mpls={[], @llc={@snap={0xaa, 0x1, ')', "90e5dd"}}}}, 0x16)
llc_conn_handler() initialises local variables {saddr,daddr}.mac based
on skb in llc_pdu_decode_sa()/llc_pdu_decode_da() and passes them to
__llc_lookup(). However, the initialisation is done only when
skb->protocol is htons(ETH_P_802_2), otherwise,
__llc_lookup_established() and __llc_lookup_listener() will read
garbage. The missing initialisation existed prior to commit
211ed865108e ("net: delete all instances of special processing for
token ring"). It removed the part to kick out the token ring stuff but
forgot to close the door allowing ETH_P_TR_802_2 packets to sneak into
llc_rcv(). Let's remove llc_tr_packet_type and complete the
deprecation. [0]: BUG: KMSAN: uninit-value in

llc: make llc_ui_sendmsg() more robust against bonding changes syzbot
was able to trick llc_ui_sendmsg(), allocating an skb with no
headroom, but subsequently trying to push 14 bytes of Ethernet header
[1] Like some others, llc_ui_sendmsg() releases the socket lock before
calling sock_alloc_send_skb(). Then it acquires it again, but does not
redo all the sanity checks that were performed. This fix: - Uses
LL_RESERVED_SPACE() to reserve space. - Check all conditions again
after socket lock is held again. - Do not account Ethernet header for
mtu limitation. [1] skbuff: skb_under_panic: text:ffff800088baa334

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
mm, kmsan: fix infinite recursion due to RCU critical section
Alexander Potapenko writes in [1]: "For every memory access in the
code instrumented by KMSAN we call kmsan_get_metadata() to obtain the
metadata for the memory being accessed. For virtual memory the
metadata pointers are stored in the corresponding `struct page`,
therefore we need to call virt_to_page() to get them. According to the
comment in arch/x86/include/asm/page.h, virt_to_page(kaddr) returns a
valid pointer iff virt_addr_valid(kaddr) is true, so KMSAN needs to
call virt_addr_valid() as well. To avoid recursion,
kmsan_get_metadata() must not call instrumented code, therefore
./arch/x86/include/asm/kmsan.h forks parts of arch/x86/mm/physaddr.c
to check whether a virtual address is valid or not. But the
introduction of rcu_read_lock() to pfn_valid() added instrumented RCU
API calls to virt_to_page_or_null(), which is called by
kmsan_get_metadata(), so there is an infinite recursion now. I do not
think it is correct to stop that recursion by doing
kmsan_enter_runtime()/kmsan_exit_runtime() in kmsan_get_metadata():
that would prevent instrumented functions called from within the
runtime from tracking the shadow values, which might introduce false
positives." Fix the issue by switching pfn_valid() to the _sched()
variant of rcu_read_lock/unlock(), which does not require calling into
RCU. Given the critical section in pfn_valid() is very small, this is
a reasonable trade-off (with preemptible RCU). KMSAN further needs to
be careful to suppress calls into the scheduler, which would be
another source of recursion. This can be done by wrapping the call to
pfn_valid() into preempt_disable/enable_no_resched(). The downside is
that this sacrifices breaking scheduling guarantees; however, a kernel
compiled with KMSAN has already given up any performance guarantees
due to being heavily instrumented. Note, KMSAN code already disables
tracing via Makefile, and since mmzone.h is included, it is not
necessary to use the notrace variant, which is generally preferred in
all other cases.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
tcp: add sanity checks to rx zerocopy TCP rx zerocopy intent is to map
pages initially allocated from NIC drivers, not pages owned by a fs.
This patch adds to can_map_frag() these additional checks: - Page must

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
netfilter: nf_tables: disallow anonymous set with timeout flag
Anonymous sets are never used with timeout from userspace, reject
this. Exception to this rule is NFT_SET_EVAL to ensure legacy meters
still work.

Reference: URL:https://git.kernel.org/stable/c/552705a3650bbf46a22b1adedc1b04181490fc36

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
netfilter: nf_tables: mark set as dead when unbinding anonymous set
with timeout While the rhashtable set gc runs asynchronously, a race
allows it to collect elements from anonymous sets with timeouts while
it is being released from the commit path. Mingi Cho originally
reported this issue in a different path in 6.1.x with a pipapo set
with low timeouts which is not possible upstream since 7395dfacfff6
("netfilter: nf_tables: use timestamp to check for set element
timeout"). Fix this by setting on the dead flag for anonymous sets to
skip async gc in this case. According to 08e4c8c5919f ("netfilter:
nf_tables: mark newset as dead on transaction abort"), Florian plans
to accelerate abort path by releasing objects via workqueue,
therefore, this sets on the dead flag for abort path too.

Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top
of Flask. A Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been
discovered on the OAuth login page. An attacker could trick a user to
follow a specially crafted URL to the OAuth login page. This URL could
inject and execute malicious javascript code that would get executed
on the user's browser. This issue was introduced on 4.1.4 and patched
on 4.2.1.

Kirby is a content management system. The new link field introduced in
Kirby 4 allows several different link types that each validate the
entered link to the relevant URL format. It also includes a "Custom"
link type for advanced use cases that don't fit any of the pre-defined
link formats. As the "Custom" link type is meant to be flexible, it
also allows the javascript: URL scheme. In some use cases this can be
intended, but it can also be misused by attackers to execute arbitrary
JavaScript code when a user or visitor clicks on a link that is
generated from the contents of the link field. This vulnerability is
patched in 4.1.1.

Minder is a Software Supply Chain Security Platform. In version 0.0.31
and earlier, it is possible for an attacker to register a repository
with a invalid or differing upstream ID, which causes Minder to report
the repository as registered, but not remediate any future changes
which conflict with policy (because the webhooks for the repo do not
match any known repository in the database). When attempting to
register a repo with a different repo ID, the registered provider must
have admin on the named repo, or a 404 error will result. Similarly,
if the stored provider token does not have repo access, then the
remediations will not apply successfully. Lastly, it appears that
reconciliation actions do not execute against repos with this type of
mismatch. This appears to primarily be a potential denial-of-service
vulnerability. This vulnerability is patched in version
0.20240226.1425+ref.53868a8.

Wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl Panel. This
vulnerability impacts anyone running the affected versions of Wings.
The vulnerability can potentially be used to access files and
directories on the host system. The full scope of impact is exactly
unknown, but reading files outside of a server's base directory
(sandbox root) is possible. In order to use this exploit, an attacker
must have an existing "server" allocated and controlled by Wings.
Details on the exploitation of this vulnerability are embargoed until
March 27th, 2024 at 18:00 UTC. In order to mitigate this
vulnerability, a full rewrite of the entire server filesystem was
necessary. Because of this, the size of the patch is massive, however
effort was made to reduce the amount of breaking changes. Users are
advised to update to version 1.11.9. There are no known workarounds
for this vulnerability.

Querybook is a Big Data Querying UI. When a user searches for their
queries, datadocs, tables and lists, the search result is marked and
highlighted, and this feature uses dangerouslySetInnerHTML which means
that if the highlighted result has an XSS payload it will trigger.
While the input to dangerouslySetInnerHTML is not sanitized for the
data inside of queries which leads to an XSS vulnerability. During the
"query auto-suggestion" the name of the suggested tables are set with
innerHTML which leads to the XSS vulnerability. A patch to rectify
this issue has been introduced in Querybook version 3.31.2.

Zulip is an open-source team collaboration. When a user moves a Zulip
message, they have the option to move all messages in the topic, move
only subsequent messages as well, or move just a single message. If
the user chose to just move one message, and was moving it from a
public stream to a private stream, Zulip would successfully move the
message, -- but active users who did not have access to the private
stream, but whose client had already received the message, would
continue to see the message in the public stream until they reloaded
their client. Additionally, Zulip did not remove view permissions on
the message from recently-active users, allowing the message to show
up in the "All messages" view or in search results, but not in "Inbox"
or "Recent conversations" views. While the bug has been present since
moving messages between streams was first introduced in version 3.0,
this option became much more common starting in Zulip 8.0, when the
default option in the picker for moving the very last message in a
conversation was changed. This issue is fixed in Zulip Server 8.3. No
known workarounds are available.

ESPHome is a system to control your ESP8266/ESP32 for Home Automation
systems. Starting in version 2023.12.9 and prior to version 2024.2.2,
editing the configuration file API in dashboard component of ESPHome
version 2023.12.9 (command line installation and Home Assistant add-
on) serves unsanitized data with `Content-Type: text/html;
charset=UTF-8`, allowing a remote authenticated user to inject
arbitrary web script and exfiltrate session cookies via Cross-Site
scripting. It is possible for a malicious authenticated user to inject
arbitrary Javascript in configuration files using a POST request to
the /edit endpoint, the configuration parameter allows to specify the
file to write. To trigger the XSS vulnerability, the victim must visit
the page` /edit?configuration=[xss file]`. Abusing this vulnerability
a malicious actor could perform operations on the dashboard on the
behalf of a logged user, access sensitive information, create, edit
and delete configuration files and flash firmware on managed boards.
In addition to this, cookies are not correctly secured, allowing the
exfiltration of session cookie values. Version 2024.2.2 contains a
patch for this issue.

pgx is a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go. Prior to version
4.18.2, SQL injection can occur when all of the following conditions
are met: the non-default simple protocol is used; a placeholder for a
numeric value must be immediately preceded by a minus; there must be a
second placeholder for a string value after the first placeholder;
both must be on the same line; and both parameter values must be user-
controlled. The problem is resolved in v4.18.2. As a workaround, do
not use the simple protocol or do not place a minus directly before a
placeholder.

exfiltrate data, take over accounts and in some cases, even achieve
RCE. The vulnerable field lies in the `authorEmail` field which uses
PHP's `FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL` filter. This filter is insufficient in
protecting against SQL injection attacks and should still be properly
escaped. However, in this version of phpMyFAQ (3.2.5), this field is
not escaped properly can be used together with other fields to fully
exploit the SQL injection vulnerability. This vulnerability is fixed

Support App is an opensource application specialized in managing Apple
devices. It's possible to abuse a vulnerability inside the postinstall
installer script to make the installer execute arbitrary code as root.
The cause of the vulnerability is the fact that the shebang
`#!/bin/zsh` is being used. When the installer is executed it asks for
the users password to be executed as root. However, it'll still be
using the $HOME of the user and therefore loading the file
`$HOME/.zshenv` when the `postinstall` script is executed. An attacker
could add malicious code to `$HOME/.zshenv` and it will be executed
when the app is installed. An attacker may leverage this vulnerability
to escalate privilege on the system. This issue has been addressed in
version 2.5.1 Rev 2. All users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this vulnerability.

electron-builder is a solution to package and build a ready for

A vulnerability that only affects eletron-builder prior to 24.13.2 in
Windows, the NSIS installer makes a system call to open cmd.exe via
NSExec in the `.nsh` installer script. NSExec by default searches the
current directory of where the installer is located before searching
`PATH`. This means that if an attacker can place a malicious
executable file named cmd.exe in the same folder as the installer, the
installer will run the malicious file. Version 24.13.2 fixes this
issue. No known workaround exists. The code executes at the installer-
level before the app is present on the system, so there's no way to
check if it exists in a current installer.

pgx is a PostgreSQL driver and toolkit for Go. SQL injection can occur
if an attacker can cause a single query or bind message to exceed 4 GB
in size. An integer overflow in the calculated message size can cause
the one large message to be sent as multiple messages under the
attacker's control. The problem is resolved in v4.18.2 and v5.5.4. As
a workaround, reject user input large enough to cause a single query
or bind message to exceed 4 GB in size.

JSONata is a JSON query and transformation language. Starting in
version 1.4.0 and prior to version 1.8.7 and 2.0.4, a malicious
expression can use the transform operator to override properties on
the `Object` constructor and prototype. This may lead to denial of
service, remote code execution or other unexpected behavior in
applications that evaluate user-provided JSONata expressions. This
issue has been fixed in JSONata versions 1.8.7 and 2.0.4. Applications
that evaluate user-provided expressions should update ASAP to prevent
exploitation. As a workaround, one may apply the patch manually.

Mio is a Metal I/O library for Rust. When using named pipes on
Windows, mio will under some circumstances return invalid tokens that
correspond to named pipes that have already been deregistered from the
mio registry. The impact of this vulnerability depends on how mio is
used. For some applications, invalid tokens may be ignored or cause a
warning or a crash. On the other hand, for applications that store
pointers in the tokens, this vulnerability may result in a use-after-
free. For users of Tokio, this vulnerability is serious and can result
in a use-after-free in Tokio. The vulnerability is Windows-specific,
and can only happen if you are using named pipes. Other IO resources
are not affected. This vulnerability has been fixed in mio v0.8.11.
All versions of mio between v0.7.2 and v0.8.10 are vulnerable. Tokio
is vulnerable when you are using a vulnerable version of mio AND you
are using at least Tokio v1.30.0. Versions of Tokio prior to v1.30.0
will ignore invalid tokens, so they are not vulnerable. Vulnerable
libraries that use mio can work around this issue by detecting and
ignoring invalid tokens.

In Pulsar Functions Worker, authenticated users can upload functions
in jar or nar files. These files, essentially zip files, are extracted
by the Functions Worker. However, if a malicious file is uploaded, it
could exploit a directory traversal vulnerability. This occurs when
the filenames in the zip files, which aren't properly validated,
contain special elements like "..", altering the directory path. This
could allow an attacker to create or modify files outside of the
designated extraction directory, potentially influencing system
behavior. This vulnerability also applies to the Pulsar Broker when it
is configured with "functionsWorkerEnabled=true". This issue affects
Apache Pulsar versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3,
from 3.0.0 to 3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 2.10 Pulsar
Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6. 2.11 Pulsar
Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4. 3.0 Pulsar
Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3. 3.1 Pulsar
Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3. 3.2 Pulsar
Function Worker users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1. Users
operating versions prior to those listed above should upgrade to the

Reference: MISC:https://pulsar.apache.org/security/CVE-2024-27894/
Reference: URL:https://pulsar.apache.org/security/CVE-2024-27894/

The Pulsar Functions Worker includes a capability that permits
authenticated users to create functions where the function's
implementation is referenced by a URL. The supported URL schemes
include "file", "http", and "https". When a function is created using
this method, the Functions Worker will retrieve the implementation
from the URL provided by the user. However, this feature introduces a
vulnerability that can be exploited by an attacker to gain
unauthorized access to any file that the Pulsar Functions Worker
process has permissions to read. This includes reading the process
environment which potentially includes sensitive information, such as
secrets. Furthermore, an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to
use the Pulsar Functions Worker as a proxy to access the content of
remote HTTP and HTTPS endpoint URLs. This could also be used to carry
out denial of service attacks. This vulnerability also applies to the
Pulsar Broker when it is configured with
"functionsWorkerEnabled=true". This issue affects Apache Pulsar
versions from 2.4.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.3, from 3.0.0 to
3.0.2, from 3.1.0 to 3.1.2, and 3.2.0. 2.10 Pulsar Function Worker
users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6. 2.11 Pulsar Function Worker
users should upgrade to at least 2.11.4. 3.0 Pulsar Function Worker
users should upgrade to at least 3.0.3. 3.1 Pulsar Function Worker
users should upgrade to at least 3.1.3. 3.2 Pulsar Function Worker
users should upgrade to at least 3.2.1. Users operating versions prior
to those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched
versions or newer versions. The updated versions of Pulsar Functions
Worker will, by default, impose restrictions on the creation of
functions using URLs. For users who rely on this functionality, the
Function Worker configuration provides two configuration keys:
"additionalEnabledConnectorUrlPatterns" and
"additionalEnabledFunctionsUrlPatterns". These keys allow users to
specify a set of URL patterns that are permitted, enabling the
creation of functions using URLs that match the defined patterns. This
approach ensures that the feature remains available to those who
require it, while limiting the potential for unauthorized access and
exploitation.

vulnerabilities in other components to achieve remote code execution.
As this project is retired, we do not plan to release a version that
fixes this issue. Users are recommended to find an alternative or
restrict access to the instance to trusted users. NOTE: This
vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by

Minder is a software supply chain security platform. Prior to version
0.0.33, a Minder user can use the endpoints `GetRepositoryByName`,
`DeleteRepositoryByName`, and `GetArtifactByName` to access any
repository in the database, irrespective of who owns the repo and any
permissions present. The database query checks by repo owner, repo
name and provider name (which is always `github`). These query values
are not distinct for the particular user - as long as the user has
valid credentials and a provider, they can set the repo owner/name to
any value they want and the server will return information on this
repo. Version 0.0.33 contains a patch for this issue.

Shopware is an open commerce platform based on Symfony Framework and
Vue. The Symfony Session Handler pops the Session Cookie and assigns
it to the Response. Since Shopware 6.5.8.0, the 404 pages are cached
to improve the performance of 404 pages. So the cached Response which
contains a Session Cookie when the Browser accessing the 404 page, has
no cookies yet. The Symfony Session Handler is in use, when no
explicit Session configuration has been done. When Redis is in use for
Sessions using the PHP Redis extension, this exploiting code is not
used. Shopware version 6.5.8.7 contains a patch for this issue. As a
workaround, use Redis for Sessions, as this does not trigger the
exploit code.

Coder allows oragnizations to provision remote development
environments via Terraform. Prior to versions 2.6.1, 2.7.3, and 2.8.4,
a vulnerability in Coder's OIDC authentication could allow an attacker
to bypass the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` verification and create an
account with an email not in the allowlist. Deployments are only
affected if the OIDC provider allows users to create accounts on the
provider. During OIDC registration, the user's email was improperly
validated against the allowed `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN`s. This could
allow a user with a domain that only partially matched an allowed
domain to successfully login or register. An attacker could register a
domain name that exploited this vulnerability and register on a Coder
instance with a public OIDC provider. Coder instances with OIDC
enabled and protected by the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` configuration
are affected. Coder instances using a private OIDC provider are not
affected, as arbitrary users cannot register through a private OIDC
provider without first having an account on the provider. Public OIDC
providers are impacted. GitHub authentication and external
authentication are not impacted. This vulnerability is remedied in
versions 2.8.4, 2.7.3, and 2.6.1 All versions prior to these patches
are affected by the vulnerability.*It is recommended that customers
upgrade their deployments as soon as possible if they are utilizing
OIDC authentication with the `CODER_OIDC_EMAIL_DOMAIN` setting.

Grav is an open-source, flat-file content management system. A file
upload path traversal vulnerability has been identified in the
application prior to version 1.7.45, enabling attackers to replace or
create files with extensions like .json, .zip, .css, .gif, etc. This
critical security flaw poses severe risks, that can allow attackers to
inject arbitrary code on the server, undermine integrity of backup
files by overwriting existing files or creating new ones, and
exfiltrate sensitive data using CSS exfiltration techniques. Upgrading
to patched version 1.7.45 can mitigate the issue.

RSSHub is an open source RSS feed generator. Prior to version
1.0.0-master.a429472, RSSHub allows remote attackers to use the server
as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and retrieve
information in the internal network or conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS)
attacks. The attacker can send malicious requests to a RSSHub server,
to make the server send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary destinations
and see partial responses. This may lead to leak the server IP
address, which could be hidden behind a CDN; retrieving information in
the internal network, e.g. which addresses/ports are accessible, the
titles and meta descriptions of HTML pages; and denial of service
amplification. The attacker could request the server to download some
large files, or chain several SSRF requests in a single attacker
request.

an import specifier's hostname is equal to or a child of a token's
hostname, which can cause tokens to be sent to servers they shouldn't
be sent to. An auth token intended for `example[.]com` may be sent to
`notexample[.]com`. Anyone who uses DENO_AUTH_TOKENS and imports
potentially untrusted code is affected. Version 1.40.0 contains a
patch for this issue

Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. In version
1.39.0, use of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to
premature close of arbitrary file descriptors, allowing standard input
to be re-opened as a different resource resulting in permission prompt
bypass. Node child_process IPC relies on the JS side to pass the raw
IPC file descriptor to `op_node_ipc_pipe()`, which returns a
`IpcJsonStreamResource` ID associated with the file descriptor. On
closing the resource, the raw file descriptor is closed together. Use
of raw file descriptors in `op_node_ipc_pipe()` leads to premature
close of arbitrary file descriptors. This allow standard input (fd 0)
to be closed and re-opened for a different resource, which allows a
silent permission prompt bypass. This is exploitable by an attacker
controlling the code executed inside a Deno runtime to obtain
arbitrary code execution on the host machine regardless of
permissions. This bug is known to be exploitable. There is a working
exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution by bypassing prompts
from zero permissions, additionally abusing the fact that Cache API
lacks filesystem permission checks. The attack can be conducted
silently as stderr can also be closed, suppressing all prompt outputs.
Version 1.39.1 fixes the bug.

Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime. Starting in
version 1.35.1 and prior to version 1.36.3, a vulnerability in Deno's
Node.js compatibility runtime allows for cross-session data
contamination during simultaneous asynchronous reads from Node.js
streams sourced from sockets or files. The issue arises from the re-
use of a global buffer (BUF) in stream_wrap.ts used as a performance
optimization to limit allocations during these asynchronous read
operations. This can lead to data intended for one session being
received by another session, potentially resulting in data corruption
and unexpected behavior. This affects all users of Deno that use the
node.js compatibility layer for network communication or other
streams, including packages that may require node.js libraries
indirectly. Version 1.36.3 contains a patch for this issue.

Deno is a JavaScript, TypeScript, and WebAssembly runtime with secure
defaults. Starting in version 1.32.1 and prior to version 1.41 of the
deno_runtime library, maliciously crafted permission request can show
the spoofed permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI escape
sequence into the request contents. Deno is stripping any ANSI escape
sequences from the permission prompt, but permissions given to the
program are based on the contents that contain the ANSI escape
sequences. Any Deno program can spoof the content of the interactive
permission prompt by inserting a broken ANSI code, which allows a
malicious Deno program to display the wrong file path or program name
to the user. Version 1.41 of the deno_runtime library contains a patch
for the issue.

Postal is an open source SMTP server. Postal versions less than 3.0.0
are vulnerable to SMTP Smuggling attacks which may allow incoming
e-mails to be spoofed. This, in conjunction with a cooperative
outgoing SMTP service, would allow for an incoming e-mail to be
received by Postal addressed from a server that a user has
'authorised' to send mail on their behalf but were not the genuine
author of the e-mail. Postal is not affected for sending outgoing
e-mails as email is re-encoded with `<CR><LF>` line endings when
transmitted over SMTP. This issue has been addressed and users should
upgrade to Postal v3.0.0 or higher. Once upgraded, Postal will only
accept End of DATA sequences which are explicitly `<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>`.
If a non-compliant sequence is detected it will be logged to the SMTP
server log. There are no workarounds for this issue.

The Apollo Router is a graph router written in Rust to run a federated
supergraph that uses Apollo Federation. Versions 0.9.5 until 1.40.2
are subject to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) type vulnerability. When
receiving compressed HTTP payloads, affected versions of the Router
evaluate the `limits.http_max_request_bytes` configuration option
after the entirety of the compressed payload is decompressed. If
affected versions of the Router receive highly compressed payloads,
this could result in significant memory consumption while the
compressed payload is expanded. Router version 1.40.2 has a fix for
the vulnerability. Those who are unable to upgrade may be able to
implement mitigations at proxies or load balancers positioned in front
of their Router fleet (e.g. Nginx, HAProxy, or cloud-native WAF
services) by creating limits on HTTP body upload size.

JWCrypto implements JWK, JWS, and JWE specifications using python-
cryptography. Prior to version 1.5.6, an attacker can cause a denial
of service attack by passing in a malicious JWE Token with a high
compression ratio. When the server processes this token, it will
consume a lot of memory and processing time. Version 1.5.6 fixes this
vulnerability by limiting the maximum token length.

Canarytokens helps track activity and actions on a network.
Canarytokens.org supports exporting the history of a Canarytoken's
incidents in CSV format. The generation of these CSV files is
vulnerable to a CSV Injection vulnerability. This flaw can be used by
an attacker who discovers an HTTP-based Canarytoken to target the
Canarytoken's owner, if the owner exports the incident history to CSV
and opens in a reader application such as Microsoft Excel. The impact
is that this issue could lead to code execution on the machine on
which the CSV file is opened. Version sha-c595a1f8 contains a fix for
this issue.

allows an attacker to host a website that will steal the user's
Codeium api-key, and thus impersonate the user on the backend
autocomplete server. This issue has not been addressed. Users are
advised to monitor the usage of their API key.

stimulus_reflex is a system to extend the capabilities of both Rails
and Stimulus by intercepting user interactions and passing them to
Rails over real-time websockets. In affected versions more methods
than expected can be called on reflex instances. Being able to call
some of them has security implications. To invoke a reflex a websocket
message of the following shape is sent:
`\"target\":\"[class_name]#[method_name]\",\"args\":[]`. The server
will proceed to instantiate `reflex` using the provided `class_name`
as long as it extends `StimulusReflex::Reflex`. It then attempts to
call `method_name` on the instance with the provided arguments. This
is problematic as `reflex.method method_name` can be more methods that
those explicitly specified by the developer in their reflex class. A
good example is the instance_variable_set method. This vulnerability
has been patched in versions 3.4.2 and 3.5.0.rc4. Users unable to
upgrade should: see the backing GHSA advisory for mitigation advice.

Wasmi is an efficient and lightweight WebAssembly interpreter with a
focus on constrained and embedded systems. In the WASMI Interpreter,
an Out-of-bounds Buffer Write will arise if the host calls or resumes
a Wasm function with more parameters than the default limit (128), as
it will surpass the stack value. This doesn&#8217;t affect calls from Wasm
to Wasm, only from host to Wasm. This vulnerability was patched in
version 0.31.1.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. Due to the improper URL protocols filtering of links
specified in the `link.argocd.argoproj.io` annotations in the
application summary component, an attacker can achieve cross-site
scripting with elevated permissions. All unpatched versions of Argo CD
starting with v1.0.0 are vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS)
bug allowing a malicious user to inject a javascript: link in the UI.
When clicked by a victim user, the script will execute with the
victim's permissions (up to and including admin). This vulnerability
allows an attacker to perform arbitrary actions on behalf of the
victim via the API, such as creating, modifying, and deleting
Kubernetes resources. A patch for this vulnerability has been released
in Argo CD versions v2.10.3 v2.9.8, and v2.8.12. There are no
completely-safe workarounds besides upgrading. The safest alternative,
if upgrading is not possible, would be to create a Kubernetes
admission controller to reject any resources with an annotation
starting with link.argocd.argoproj.io or reject the resource if the
value use an improper URL protocol. This validation will need to be
applied in all clusters managed by ArgoCD.

Jupyter Server Proxy allows users to run arbitrary external processes
alongside their Jupyter notebook servers and provides authenticated
web access. Prior to versions 3.2.3 and 4.1.1, Jupyter Server Proxy
did not check user authentication appropriately when proxying
websockets, allowing unauthenticated access to anyone who had network
access to the Jupyter server endpoint. This vulnerability can allow
unauthenticated remote access to any websocket endpoint set up to be
accessible via Jupyter Server Proxy. In many cases, this leads to
remote unauthenticated arbitrary code execution, due to how affected
instances use websockets. The websocket endpoints exposed by
`jupyter_server` itself is not affected. Projects that do not rely on
websockets are also not affected. Versions 3.2.3 and 4.1.1 contain a
fix for this issue.

Package jose aims to provide an implementation of the Javascript
Object Signing and Encryption set of standards. An attacker could send
a JWE containing compressed data that used large amounts of memory and
CPU when decompressed by Decrypt or DecryptMulti. Those functions now
return an error if the decompressed data would exceed 250kB or 10x the
compressed size (whichever is larger). This vulnerability has been
patched in versions 4.0.1, 3.0.3 and 2.6.3.

turbo_boost-commands is a set of commands to help you build robust
reactive applications with Rails & Hotwire. TurboBoost Commands has
existing protections in place to guarantee that only public methods on
Command classes can be invoked; however, the existing checks aren't as
robust as they should be. It's possible for a sophisticated attacker
to invoke more methods than should be permitted depending on the the
strictness of authorization checks that individual applications
enforce. Being able to call some of these methods can have security
implications. Commands verify that the class must be a `Command` and
that the method requested is defined as a public method; however, this
isn't robust enough to guard against all unwanted code execution. The
library should more strictly enforce which methods are considered safe
before allowing them to be executed. This issue has been addressed in
versions 0.1.3, and 0.2.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
to upgrade should see the repository GHSA for workaround advice.

ESP-IDF is the development framework for Espressif SoCs supported on
Windows, Linux and macOS. A Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use (TOCTOU)
vulnerability was discovered in the implementation of the ESP-IDF
bootloader which could allow an attacker with physical access to flash
of the device to bypass anti-rollback protection. Anti-rollback
prevents rollback to application with security version lower than one
programmed in eFuse of chip. This attack can allow to boot past
(passive) application partition having lower security version of the
same device even in the presence of the flash encryption scheme. The
attack requires carefully modifying the flash contents after the anti-
rollback checks have been performed by the bootloader (before loading
the application). The vulnerability is fixed in 4.4.7 and 5.2.1.

FreeScout is an open source help desk and shared inbox built with PHP.
A vulnerability has been identified in the Free Scout Application,
which exposes SMTP server credentials used by an organization in the
application to users of the application. This issue arises from the
application storing complete stack traces of exceptions in its
database. The sensitive information is then inadvertently disclosed to
users via the `/conversation/ajax-
html/send_log?folder_id=&thread_id={id}` endpoint. The stack trace
reveals value of parameters, including the username and password,
passed to the
`Swift_Transport_Esmtp_Auth_LoginAuthenticator->authenticate()`
function. Exploiting this vulnerability allows an attacker to gain
unauthorized access to SMTP server credentials. With this sensitive
information in hand, the attacker can potentially send unauthorized
emails from the compromised SMTP server, posing a severe threat to the
confidentiality and integrity of email communications. This could lead
to targeted attacks on both the application users and the organization
itself, compromising the security of email exchange servers. This
issue has been addressed in version 1.8.124. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should adopt the following measures:
1. Avoid Storing Complete Stack Traces, 2. Implement redaction
mechanisms to filter and exclude sensitive information, and 3. Review
and enhance the application's logging practices.

your_spotify is an open source, self hosted Spotify tracking
dashboard. YourSpotify version < 1.9.0 does not prevent other pages
from displaying it in an iframe and is thus vulnerable to
clickjacking. Clickjacking can be used to trick an existing user of
YourSpotify to trigger actions, such as allowing signup of other users
or deleting the current user account. Clickjacking works by opening
the target application in an invisible iframe on an attacker-
controlled site and luring a victim to visit the attacker page and
interacting with it. By positioning elements over the invisible
iframe, a victim can be tricked into triggering malicious or
destructive actions in the invisible iframe, while they think they
interact with a totally different site altogether. When a victim
visits an attacker-controlled site while they are logged into
YourSpotify, they can be tricked into performing actions on their
YourSpotify instance without their knowledge. These actions include
allowing signup of other users or deleting the current user account,
resulting in a high impact to the integrity of YourSpotify. This issue
has been addressed in version 1.9.0. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/zitadel/zitadel/security/advisories/GHSA-mq4x-r2w3-j7mr

Zitadel is an open source identity management system. Zitadel uses a
cookie to identify the user agent (browser) and its user sessions.
Although the cookie was handled according to best practices, it was
accessible on subdomains of the ZITADEL instance. An attacker could
take advantage of this and provide a malicious link hosted on the
subdomain to the user to gain access to the victim&#8217;s account in
certain scenarios. A possible victim would need to login through the
malicious link for this exploit to work. If the possible victim
already had the cookie present, the attack would not succeed. The
attack would further only be possible if there was an initial
vulnerability on the subdomain. This could either be the attacker
being able to control DNS or a XSS vulnerability in an application
hosted on a subdomain. Versions 2.46.0, 2.45.1, and 2.44.3 have been
patched. Zitadel recommends upgrading to the latest versions available
in due course. Note that applying the patch will invalidate the
current cookie and thus users will need to start a new session and
existing sessions (user selection) will be empty. For self-hosted
environments unable to upgrade to a patched version, prevent setting
the following cookie name on subdomains of your Zitadel instance (e.g.
within your WAF): `__Secure-zitadel-useragent`.

OpenOlat is an open source web-based e-learning platform for teaching,
learning, assessment and communication. By manually manipulating http
requests when using the draw.io integration it is possible to read
arbitrary files as the configured system user and SSRF. The problem is
fixed in version 18.1.6 and 18.2.2. It is advised to upgrade to the
latest version of 18.1.x or 18.2.x. Users unable to upgrade may work
around this issue by disabling the Draw.io module or the entire REST
API which will secure the system.

phlex is an open source framework for building object-oriented views
in Ruby. There is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. This was due
to improper case-sensitivity in the code that was meant to prevent
these attacks. If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set
to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute
JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided
attributes when rendering any HTML tag, malicious event attributes
could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events
are triggered by another user. Patches are available on RubyGems for
all 1.x minor versions. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
upgrade should consider configuring a content security policy that
does not allow `unsafe-inline`.

eprosima Fast DDS is a C++ implementation of the Data Distribution
Service standard of the Object Management Group. Prior to versions
2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8, manipulated DATA Submessage
can cause a heap overflow error in the Fast-DDS process, causing the
process to be terminated remotely. Additionally, the payload_size in
the DATA Submessage packet is declared as uint32_t. When a negative
number, such as -1, is input into this variable, it results in an
Integer Overflow (for example, -1 gets converted to 0xFFFFFFFF). This
eventually leads to a heap-buffer-overflow, causing the program to
terminate. Versions 2.14.0, 2.13.4, 2.12.3, 2.10.4, and 2.6.8 contain
a fix for this issue.

Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux
container technology written in Golang. Vela pipelines can use
variable substitution combined with insensitive fields like
`parameters`, `image` and `entrypoint` to inject secrets into a
plugin/image and &#8212; by using common substitution string manipulation &#8212;
can bypass log masking and expose secrets without the use of the
commands block. This unexpected behavior primarily impacts secrets
restricted by the "no commands" option. This can lead to unintended
use of the secret value, and increased risk of exposing the secret
during image execution bypassing log masking. **To exploit this** the
pipeline author must be supplying the secrets to a plugin that is
designed in such a way that will print those parameters in logs.
Plugin parameters are not designed for sensitive values and are often
intentionally printed throughout execution for informational/debugging
purposes. Parameters should therefore be treated as insensitive. While
Vela provides secrets masking, secrets exposure is not entirely solved
by the masking process. A docker image (plugin) can easily expose
secrets if they are not handled properly, or altered in some way.
There is a responsibility on the end-user to understand how values
injected into a plugin are used. This is a risk that exists for many
CICD systems (like GitHub Actions) that handle sensitive runtime
variables. Rather, the greater risk is that users who restrict a
secret to the "no commands" option and use image restriction can still
have their secret value exposed via substitution tinkering, which
turns the image and command restrictions into a false sense of
security. This issue has been addressed in version 0.23.2. Users are
advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not provide
sensitive values to plugins that can potentially expose them,
especially in `parameters` that are not intended to be used for
sensitive values, ensure plugins (especially those that utilize shared
secrets) follow best practices to avoid logging parameters that are
expected to be sensitive, minimize secrets with `pull_request` events
enabled, as this allows users to change pipeline configurations and
pull in secrets to steps not typically part of the CI process, make
use of the build approval setting, restricting builds from untrusted
users, and limit use of shared secrets, as they are less restrictive
to access by nature.

OctoPrint provides a web interface for controlling consumer 3D
printers. OctoPrint versions up until and including 1.9.3 contain a
vulnerability that allows malicious admins to configure or talk a
victim with administrator rights into configuring a webcam snapshot
URL which when tested through the "Test" button included in the web
interface will execute JavaScript code in the victims browser when
attempting to render the snapshot image. An attacker who successfully
talked a victim with admin rights into performing a snapshot test with
such a crafted URL could use this to retrieve or modify sensitive
configuration settings, interrupt prints or otherwise interact with
the OctoPrint instance in a malicious way. The vulnerability is
patched in version 1.10.0rc3. OctoPrint administrators are strongly
advised to thoroughly vet who has admin access to their installation
and what settings they modify based on instructions by strangers.

site, the user can be phished into clicking a legitimate directus site
and be taken to a malicious site made to look like a an error message
"Your password needs to be updated" to phish out the current password.
Users who login via OAuth2 into Directus may be at risk. This issue
has been addressed in version 10.10.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. KaTeX
users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter
malicious input using `\edef` that causes a near-infinite loop,
despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. This can be used as

KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. KaTeX
users who render untrusted mathematical expressions could encounter
malicious input using `\def` or `\newcommand` that causes a near-
infinite loop, despite setting `maxExpand` to avoid such loops. KaTeX
supports an option named maxExpand which aims to prevent infinitely
recursive macros from consuming all available memory and/or triggering
a stack overflow error. Unfortunately, support for "Unicode
(sub|super)script characters" allows an attacker to bypass this limit.
Each sub/superscript group instantiated a separate Parser with its own
limit on macro executions, without inheriting the current count of
macro executions from its parent. This has been corrected in KaTeX
v0.16.10.

KaTeX is a JavaScript library for TeX math rendering on the web. Code
that uses KaTeX's `trust` option, specifically that provides a
function to blacklist certain URL protocols, can be fooled by URLs in
malicious inputs that use uppercase characters in the protocol. In

CoreWCF is a port of the service side of Windows Communication
Foundation (WCF) to .NET Core. If you have a NetFraming based CoreWCF
service, extra system resources could be consumed by connections being
left established instead of closing or aborting them. There are two
scenarios when this can happen. When a client established a connection
to the service and sends no data, the service will wait indefinitely
for the client to initiate the NetFraming session handshake.
Additionally, once a client has established a session, if the client
doesn't send any requests for the period of time configured in the
binding ReceiveTimeout, the connection is not properly closed as part
of the session being aborted. The bindings affected by this behavior
are NetTcpBinding, NetNamedPipeBinding, and UnixDomainSocketBinding.
Only NetTcpBinding has the ability to accept non local connections.
The currently supported versions of CoreWCF are v1.4.x and v1.5.x. The
fix can be found in v1.4.2 and v1.5.2 of the CoreWCF packages. Users
are advised to upgrade. There are no workarounds for this issue.

OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and
governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage,
and seamless team collaboration. `CompiledRule::validateExpression` is
also called from `PolicyRepository.prepare`. `prepare()` is called
from `EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which, in turn, gets called
from `EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that even though there is
an authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`), it gets called
after `prepareInternal()` gets called and therefore after the SpEL
expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method, an
attacker can send a PUT request to `/api/v1/policies` which gets
handled by `PolicyResource.createOrUpdate()`. This vulnerability was
discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection
(Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-252`. This issue may
lead to Remote Code Execution and has been addressed in version 1.3.1.

OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and
governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage,
and seamless team collaboration. The `&#8206;AlertUtil::validateExpression`
method evaluates an SpEL expression using `getValue` which by default
uses the `StandardEvaluationContext`, allowing the expression to reach
and interact with Java classes such as `java.lang.Runtime`, leading to
Remote Code Execution. The
`/api/v1/events/subscriptions/validation/condition/<expression>`
endpoint passes user-controlled data `AlertUtil::validateExpession`
allowing authenticated (non-admin) users to execute arbitrary system
commands on the underlaying operating system. In addition, there is a
missing authorization check since `Authorizer.authorize()` is never
called in the affected path and, therefore, any authenticated non-
admin user is able to trigger this endpoint and evaluate arbitrary
SpEL expressions leading to arbitrary command execution. This
vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression
language injection (Spring) query and is also tracked as
`GHSL-2023-235`. This issue may lead to Remote Code Execution and has

OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and
governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage,
and seamless team collaboration. The `JwtFilter` handles the API
authentication by requiring and verifying JWT tokens. When a new
request comes in, the request's path is checked against this list.
When the request's path contains any of the excluded endpoints the
filter returns without validating the JWT. Unfortunately, an attacker
may use Path Parameters to make any path contain any arbitrary
strings. For example, a request to `GET /api/v1;v1%2fusers%2flogin/eve
nts/subscriptions/validation/condition/111` will match the excluded
endpoint condition and therefore will be processed with no JWT
validation allowing an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism
and reach any arbitrary endpoint, including the ones listed above that
lead to arbitrary SpEL expression injection. This bypass will not work
when the endpoint uses the `SecurityContext.getUserPrincipal()` since
it will return `null` and will throw an NPE. This issue may lead to
authentication bypass and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users
are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability. This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-237`.

A flaw was found in GnuTLS. The Minerva attack is a cryptographic
vulnerability that exploits deterministic behavior in systems like
GnuTLS, leading to side-channel leaks. In specific scenarios, such as
when using the GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_FLAG_REPRODUCIBLE flag, it can result in
a noticeable step in nonce size from 513 to 512 bits, exposing a
potential timing side-channel.

OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and
governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage,
and seamless team collaboration. Similarly to the GHSL-2023-250 issue,
`AlertUtil::validateExpression` is also called from
`EventSubscriptionRepository.prepare()`, which can lead to Remote Code
Execution. `prepare()` is called from
`EntityRepository.prepareInternal()` which, in turn, gets called from
`EntityResource.createOrUpdate()`. Note that, even though there is an
authorization check (`authorizer.authorize()`), it gets called after
`prepareInternal()` gets called and, therefore, after the SpEL
expression has been evaluated. In order to reach this method, an
attacker can send a PUT request to `/api/v1/events/subscriptions`
which gets handled by
`EventSubscriptionResource.createOrUpdateEventSubscription()`. This
vulnerability was discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression
language injection (Spring) query. This issue may lead to Remote Code
Execution and has been addressed in version 1.2.4. Users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
This issue is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-251`.

OpenMetadata is a unified platform for discovery, observability, and
governance powered by a central metadata repository, in-depth lineage,
and seamless team collaboration. The
`&#8206;CompiledRule::validateExpression` method evaluates an SpEL
expression using an `StandardEvaluationContext`, allowing the
expression to reach and interact with Java classes such as
`java.lang.Runtime`, leading to Remote Code Execution. The
`/api/v1/policies/validation/condition/<expression>` endpoint passes
user-controlled data `CompiledRule::validateExpession` allowing
authenticated (non-admin) users to execute arbitrary system commands
on the underlaying operating system. In addition, there is a missing
authorization check since `Authorizer.authorize()` is never called in
the affected path and therefore any authenticated non-admin user is
able to trigger this endpoint and evaluate arbitrary SpEL expressions
leading to arbitrary command execution. This vulnerability was
discovered with the help of CodeQL's Expression language injection
(Spring) query and is also tracked as `GHSL-2023-236`. This issue may
lead to Remote Code Execution and has been resolved in version 1.2.4.
Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

WP Crontrol controls the cron events on WordPress websites. WP
Crontrol includes a feature that allows administrative users to create
events in the WP-Cron system that store and execute PHP code subject
to the restrictive security permissions documented here. While there
is no known vulnerability in this feature on its own, there exists
potential for this feature to be vulnerable to RCE if it were
specifically targeted via vulnerability chaining that exploited a
separate SQLi (or similar) vulnerability. This is exploitable on a
site if one of the below preconditions are met, the site is vulnerable
to a writeable SQLi vulnerability in any plugin, theme, or WordPress
core, the site's database is compromised at the hosting level, the
site is vulnerable to a method of updating arbitrary options in the
wp_options table, or the site is vulnerable to a method of triggering
an arbitrary action, filter, or function with control of the
parameters. As a hardening measure, WP Crontrol version 1.16.2 ships
with a new feature that prevents tampering of the code stored in a PHP
cron event.

The Snowflake Hive metastore connector provides an easy way to query
Hive-managed data via Snowflake. Snowflake Hive MetaStore Connector
has addressed a potential elevation of privilege vulnerability in a
`helper script` for the Hive MetaStore Connector. A malicious insider
without admin privileges could, in theory, use the script to download
content from a Microsoft domain to the local system and replace the
valid content with malicious code. If the attacker then also had local
access to the same system where the maliciously modified script is
run, they could attempt to manipulate users into executing the
attacker-controlled helper script, potentially gaining elevated
privileges to the local system. The vulnerability in the script was
patched on February 09, 2024, without a version bump to the Connector.
User who use the helper script are strongly advised to use the latest
version as soon as possible. Users unable to upgrade should avoid
using the helper script.

tls-listener is a rust lang wrapper around a connection listener to
support TLS. With the default configuration of tls-listener, a
malicious user can open 6.4 `TcpStream`s a second, sending 0 bytes,
and can trigger a DoS. The default configuration options make any
public service using `TlsListener::new()` vulnerable to a slow-loris
DoS attack. This impacts any publicly accessible service using the
default configuration of tls-listener in versions prior to 0.10.0.
Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate
this by passing a large value, such as `usize::MAX` as the parameter
to `Builder::max_handshakes`.

ZITADEL, open source authentication management software, uses Go
templates to render the login UI. Due to a improper use of the
`text/template` instead of the `html/template` package, the Login UI

2.45.1, 2.44.3, 2.43.9, 2.42.15, and 2.41.15. An attacker could create
a malicious link, where he injected code which would be rendered as
part of the login screen. While it was possible to inject HTML
including JavaScript, the execution of such scripts would be prevented
by the Content Security Policy. Versions 2.47.3, 2.46.1, 2.45.1,

Symfony1 is a community fork of symfony 1.4 with DIC, form
enhancements, latest Swiftmailer, better performance, composer
compatible and PHP 8 support. Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to
vulnerable Swift Mailer dependency that would enable an attacker to
get remote code execution if a developer unserialize user input in his
project. This vulnerability present no direct threat but is a vector
that will enable remote code execution if a developper deserialize
user untrusted data. Symfony 1 depends on Swift Mailer which is
bundled by default in vendor directory in the default installation
since 1.3.0. Swift Mailer classes implement some `__destruct()`
methods. These methods are called when php destroys the object in
memory. However, it is possible to include any object type in
`$this->_keys` to make PHP access to another array/object properties
than intended by the developer. In particular, it is possible to abuse
the array access which is triggered on foreach($this->_keys ...) for
any class implementing ArrayAccess interface. This may allow an
attacker to execute any PHP command which leads to remote code
execution. This issue has been addressed in version 1.5.18. Users are
advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

PHP framework for web projects. Starting in version 1.1.0 and prior to
version 1.5.19, Symfony 1 has a gadget chain due to dangerous
deserialization in `sfNamespacedParameterHolder` class that would
enable an attacker to get remote code execution if a developer
deserializes user input in their project. Version 1.5.19 contains a
patch for the issue.

node-tar is a Tar for Node.js. node-tar prior to version 6.2.1 has no
limit on the number of sub-folders created in the folder creation
process. An attacker who generates a large number of sub-folders can
consume memory on the system running node-tar and even crash the
Node.js client within few seconds of running it using a path with too
many sub-folders inside. Version 6.2.1 fixes this issue by preventing
extraction in excessively deep sub-folders.

SecureProps is a PHP library designed to simplify the encryption and
decryption of property data in objects. A vulnerability in SecureProps
version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 involves a regex failing to detect tags during
decryption of encrypted data. This occurs when the encrypted data has
been encoded with `NullEncoder` and passed to `TagAwareCipher`, and
contains special characters such as `\n`. As a result, the decryption
process is skipped since the tags are not detected. This causes the
encrypted data to be returned in plain format. The vulnerability
affects users who implement `TagAwareCipher` with any base cipher that
has `NullEncoder` (not default). The patch for the issue has been
released. Users are advised to update to version 1.2.2. As a
workaround, one may use the default `Base64Encoder` with the base
cipher decorated with `TagAwareCipher` to prevent special characters
in the encrypted string from interfering with regex tag detection
logic. This workaround is safe but may involve double encoding since
`TagAwareCipher` uses `NullEncoder` by default.

Moby is an open source container framework that is a key component of
Docker Engine, Docker Desktop, and other distributions of container
tooling or runtimes. Moby's networking implementation allows for many
networks, each with their own IP address range and gateway, to be
defined. This feature is frequently referred to as custom networks, as
each network can have a different driver, set of parameters and thus
behaviors. When creating a network, the `--internal` flag is used to
designate a network as _internal_. The `internal` attribute in a
docker-compose.yml file may also be used to mark a network _internal_,
and other API clients may specify the `internal` parameter as well.
When containers with networking are created, they are assigned unique
network interfaces and IP addresses. The host serves as a router for
non-internal networks, with a gateway IP that provides SNAT/DNAT
to/from container IPs. Containers on an internal network may
communicate between each other, but are precluded from communicating
with any networks the host has access to (LAN or WAN) as no default
route is configured, and firewall rules are set up to drop all
outgoing traffic. Communication with the gateway IP address (and thus
appropriately configured host services) is possible, and the host may
communicate with any container IP directly. In addition to configuring
the Linux kernel's various networking features to enable container
networking, `dockerd` directly provides some services to container
networks. Principal among these is serving as a resolver, enabling
service discovery, and resolution of names from an upstream resolver.
When a DNS request for a name that does not correspond to a container
is received, the request is forwarded to the configured upstream
resolver. This request is made from the container's network namespace:
the level of access and routing of traffic is the same as if the
request was made by the container itself. As a consequence of this
design, containers solely attached to an internal network will be
unable to resolve names using the upstream resolver, as the container
itself is unable to communicate with that nameserver. Only the names
of containers also attached to the internal network are able to be
resolved. Many systems run a local forwarding DNS resolver. As the
host and any containers have separate loopback devices, a consequence
of the design described above is that containers are unable to resolve
names from the host's configured resolver, as they cannot reach these
addresses on the host loopback device. To bridge this gap, and to
allow containers to properly resolve names even when a local
forwarding resolver is used on a loopback address, `dockerd` detects
this scenario and instead forward DNS requests from the host namework
namespace. The loopback resolver then forwards the requests to its
configured upstream resolvers, as expected. Because `dockerd` forwards
DNS requests to the host loopback device, bypassing the container
network namespace's normal routing semantics entirely, internal
networks can unexpectedly forward DNS requests to an external
nameserver. By registering a domain for which they control the
authoritative nameservers, an attacker could arrange for a compromised
container to exfiltrate data by encoding it in DNS queries that will
eventually be answered by their nameservers. Docker Desktop is not
affected, as Docker Desktop always runs an internal resolver on a RFC
1918 address. Moby releases 26.0.0, 25.0.4, and 23.0.11 are patched to
prevent forwarding any DNS requests from internal networks. As a
workaround, run containers intended to be solely attached to internal
networks with a custom upstream address, which will force all upstream
DNS queries to be resolved from the container's network namespace.

ESPHome is a system to control microcontrollers remotely through Home
Automation systems. API endpoints in dashboard component of ESPHome
version 2023.12.9 (command line installation) are vulnerable to Cross-
Site Request Forgery (CSRF) allowing remote attackers to carry out
attacks against a logged user of the dashboard to perform operations
on configuration files (create, edit, delete). It is possible for a
malicious actor to create a specifically crafted web page that
triggers a cross site request against ESPHome, this allows bypassing
the authentication for API calls on the platform. This vulnerability
allows bypassing authentication on API calls accessing configuration
file operations on the behalf of a logged user. In order to trigger
the vulnerability, the victim must visit a weaponized page. In
addition to this, it is possible to chain this vulnerability with
GHSA-9p43-hj5j-96h5/ CVE-2024-27287 to obtain a complete takeover of
the user account. Version 2024.3.0 contains a patch for this issue.

Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework
for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol
servers & clients. The `HttpPostRequestDecoder` can be tricked to
accumulate data. While the decoder can store items on the disk if
configured so, there are no limits to the number of fields the form
can have, an attacher can send a chunked post consisting of many small
fields that will be accumulated in the `bodyListHttpData` list. The
decoder cumulates bytes in the `undecodedChunk` buffer until it can
decode a field, this field can cumulate data without limits. This
vulnerability is fixed in 4.1.108.Final.

Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any
infrastructure that can run Node.js. Prior to versions 6.5.5 and
7.0.0-alpha.29, calling an invalid Parse Server Cloud Function name or
Cloud Job name crashes the server and may allow for code injection,
internal store manipulation or remote code execution. The patch in
versions 6.5.5 and 7.0.0-alpha.29 added string sanitation for Cloud
Function name and Cloud Job name. As a workaround, sanitize the Cloud
Function name and Cloud Job name before it reaches Parse Server.

OAuthenticator provides plugins for JupyterHub to use common OAuth
providers, as well as base classes for writing one's own
Authenticators with any OAuth 2.0 provider.
`GoogleOAuthenticator.hosted_domain` is used to restrict what Google
accounts can be authorized access to a JupyterHub. The restriction is
intented to be to Google accounts part of one or more Google
organization verified to control specified domain(s). Prior to version
16.3.0, the actual restriction has been to Google accounts with emails
ending with the domain. Such accounts could have been created by
anyone which at one time was able to read an email associated with the
domain. This was described by Dylan Ayrey (@dxa4481) in this [blog
post] from 15th December 2023). OAuthenticator 16.3.0 contains a patch
for this issue. As a workaround, restrict who can login another way,
such as `allowed_users` or `allowed_google_groups`.

CarrierWave is a solution for file uploads for Rails, Sinatra and
other Ruby web frameworks. The vulnerability CVE-2023-49090 wasn't
fully addressed. This vulnerability is caused by the fact that when
uploading to object storage, including Amazon S3, it is possible to
set a Content-Type value that is interpreted by browsers to be
different from what's allowed by `content_type_allowlist`, by
providing multiple values separated by commas. This bypassed value can
be used to cause XSS. Upgrade to 3.0.7 or 2.2.6.

Saleor Storefront is software for building e-commerce experiences.
Prior to commit 579241e75a5eb332ccf26e0bcdd54befa33f4783, when any
user authenticates in the storefront, anonymous users are able to
access their data. The session is leaked through cache and can be
accessed by anyone. Users should upgrade to a version that
incorporates commit 579241e75a5eb332ccf26e0bcdd54befa33f4783 or later
to receive a patch. A possible workaround is to temporarily disable
authentication by changing the usage of `createSaleorAuthClient()`.

datahub-helm provides the Kubernetes Helm charts for deploying Datahub
and its dependencies on a Kubernetes cluster. Starting in version
0.1.143 and prior to version 0.2.182, due to configuration issues in
the helm chart, if there was a successful initial deployment during a
limited window of time, personal access tokens were possibly created
with a default secret key. Since the secret key is a static, publicly
available value, someone could inspect the algorithm used to generate
personal access tokens and generate their own for an instance.
Deploying with Metadata Service Authentication enabled would have been
difficult during window of releases. If someone circumvented the helm
settings and manually set Metadata Service Authentication to be
enabled using environment variables directly, this would skip over the
autogeneration logic for the Kubernetes Secrets and DataHub GMS would
default to the signing key specified statically in the
application.yml. Most deployments probably did not attempt to
circumvent the helm settings to enable Metadata Service Authentication
during this time, so impact is most likely limited. Any deployments
with Metadata Service Authentication enabled should ensure that their
secret values are properly randomized. Version 0.2.182 contains a
patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may reset the token signing
key to be a random value, which will invalidate active personal access
tokens.

Express.js minimalist web framework for node. Versions of Express.js
prior to 4.19.0 and all pre-release alpha and beta versions of 5.0 are
affected by an open redirect vulnerability using malformed URLs. When
a user of Express performs a redirect using a user-provided URL
Express performs an encode [using
`encodeurl`](https://github.com/pillarjs/encodeurl) on the contents
before passing it to the `location` header. This can cause malformed
URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list
implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect
via bypass of a properly implemented allow list. The main method
impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within
`res.redirect()`. The vulnerability is fixed in 4.19.2 and
5.0.0-beta.3.

Translate is a package that allows users to convert text to different
languages on Node.js and the browser. Prior to version 3.0.0, an
attacker controlling the second variable of the `translate` function
is able to perform a cache poisoning attack. They can change the
outcome of translation requests made by subsequent users. The `opt.id`
parameter allows the overwriting of the cache key. If an attacker sets
the `id` variable to the cache key that would be generated by another
user, they can choose the response that user gets served. Version
3.0.0 fixes this issue.
