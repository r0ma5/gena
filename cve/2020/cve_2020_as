`@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and
manages the `node_modules` folder hierarchy for the npm command line
interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be
met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed
into the expected folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving
dependency specifiers defined in `package.json` manifests for
dependencies with a specific name, and nesting folders to resolve
conflicting dependencies. When multiple dependencies differ only in
the case of their name, Arborist's internal data structure saw them as
separate items that could coexist within the same level in the
`node_modules` hierarchy. However, on case-insensitive file systems
(such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined with a
symlink dependency such as `file:/some/path`, this allowed an attacker
to create a situation in which arbitrary contents could be written to
any location on the filesystem. For example, a package `pwn-a` could
define a dependency in their `package.json` file such as `"foo":
"file:/some/path"`. Another package, `pwn-b` could define a dependency
such as `FOO: "file:foo.tgz"`. On case-insensitive file systems, if
`pwn-a` was installed, and then `pwn-b` was installed afterwards, the
contents of `foo.tgz` would be written to `/some/path`, and any
existing contents of `/some/path` would be removed. Anyone using npm
v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive filesystem is potentially
affected. This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included
in npm v7.20.7 and above.

`@npmcli/arborist`, the library that calculates dependency trees and
manages the node_modules folder hierarchy for the npm command line
interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency contracts will be
met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed
into the expected folder. This is accomplished by extracting package
contents into a project's `node_modules` folder. If the `node_modules`
folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow
replaced with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write
package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system.
Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents
are filtered out, so another means of creating a `node_modules`
symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A `preinstall` script
could replace `node_modules` with a symlink. (This is prevented by
using `--ignore-scripts`.) 2. An attacker could supply the target with
a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-
scripts` in the root. This may be successful, because `npm install
--ignore-scripts` is typically not capable of making changes outside
of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe. This is patched in
@npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For
more information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-
gmw6-94gg-2rc2.

Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any
infrastructure that can run Node.js. Developers can use the REST API
to signup users and also allow users to login anonymously. Prior to
version 4.5.1, when an anonymous user is first signed up using REST,
the server creates session incorrectly. Particularly, the
`authProvider` field in `_Session` class under `createdWith` shows the
user logged in creating a password. If a developer later depends on
the `createdWith` field to provide a different level of access between
a password user and anonymous user, the server incorrectly classified
the session type as being created with a `password`. The server does
not currently use `createdWith` to make decisions about internal
functions, so if a developer is not using `createdWith` directly, they
are not affected. The vulnerability only affects users who depend on
`createdWith` by using it directly. The issue is patched in Parse
Server version 4.5.1. As a workaround, do not use the `createdWith`
Session field to make decisions if one allows anonymous login.

XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back
again. In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote
attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by
manipulating the processed input stream. A user is only affected if
using the version out of the box with JDK 1.7u21 or below. However,
this scenario can be adjusted easily to an external Xalan that works
regardless of the version of the Java runtime. No user is affected,
who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework
with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18
uses no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for
general purpose.

Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform.
A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in uses of TAR files by
AppEngine for deployments. This uses a utility to extract files
locally for deployment without validating the paths in that deployment

files on the container, POTENTIALLY introducing a MITM type attack
vector by replacing libraries or injecting wrapper files. Users are
advised to update as soon as possible. For users unable to update

XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back
again. In affected versions this vulnerability may allow a remote
attacker to load and execute arbitrary code from a remote host only by
manipulating the processed input stream. No user is affected, who
followed the recommendation to setup XStream's security framework with
a whitelist limited to the minimal required types. XStream 1.4.18 uses
no longer a blacklist by default, since it cannot be secured for
general purpose.

Istio is an open source platform for providing a uniform way to
integrate microservices, manage traffic flow across microservices,
enforce policies and aggregate telemetry data. According to [RFC
4343](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4343), Istio
authorization policy should compare the hostname in the HTTP Host
header in a case insensitive way, but currently the comparison is case
sensitive. The proxy will route the request hostname in a case-
insensitive way which means the authorization policy could be
bypassed. As an example, the user may have an authorization policy
that rejects request with hostname "httpbin.foo" for some source IPs,
but the attacker can bypass this by sending the request with hostname
"Httpbin.Foo". Patches are available in Istio 1.11.1, Istio 1.10.4 and
Istio 1.9.8. As a work around a Lua filter may be written to normalize
Host header before the authorization check. This is similar to the
Path normalization presented in the [Security Best
Practices](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ops/best-
practices/security/#case-normalization) guide.

BinderHub is a kubernetes-based cloud service that allows users to
share reproducible interactive computing environments from code
repositories. In affected versions a remote code execution
vulnerability has been identified in BinderHub, where providing
BinderHub with maliciously crafted input could execute code in the
BinderHub context, with the potential to egress credentials of the
BinderHub deployment, including JupyterHub API tokens, kubernetes
service accounts, and docker registry credentials. This may provide
the ability to manipulate images and other user created pods in the
deployment, with the potential to escalate to the host depending on
the underlying kubernetes configuration. Users are advised to update
to version 0.2.0-n653. If users are unable to update they may disable
the git repo provider by specifying the `BinderHub.repo_providers` as
a workaround.

Pomerium is an open source identity-aware access proxy. Envoy, which
Pomerium is based on, can abnormally terminate if an H/2 GOAWAY and
SETTINGS frame are received in the same IO event. This can lead to a
DoS in the presence of untrusted *upstream* servers. 0.15.1 contains
an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched. If only
trusted upstreams are configured, there is not substantial risk of
this condition being triggered.

Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and Voice
over IP. In versions 1.41.0 and prior, unauthorised users can access
the name, avatar, topic and number of members of a room if they know
the ID of the room. This vulnerability is limited to homeservers where
the vulnerable homeserver is in the room and untrusted users are
permitted to create groups (communities). By default, only homeserver
administrators can create groups. However, homeserver administrators
can already access this information in the database or using the admin
API. As a result, only homeservers where the configuration setting
`enable_group_creation` has been set to `true` are impacted. Server
administrators should upgrade to 1.41.1 or higher to patch the
vulnerability. There are two potential workarounds. Server
administrators can set `enable_group_creation` to `false` in their
homeserver configuration (this is the default value) to prevent
creation of groups by non-administrators. Administrators that are
using a reverse proxy could, with partial loss of group functionality,
block the endpoints `/_matrix/client/r0/groups/{group_id}/rooms` and
`/_matrix/client/unstable/groups/{group_id}/rooms`.

file must have `images.domains` array assigned and the image host
assigned in `images.domains` must allow user-provided SVG. If the
`next.config.js` file has `images.loader` assigned to something other
than default or the instance is deployed on Vercel, the instance is
not affected by the vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in
Next.js version 11.1.1.

DHIS 2 is an information system for data capture, management,
validation, analytics and visualization. A SQL Injection vulnerability
in the Tracker component in DHIS2 Server allows authenticated remote
attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors.
This vulnerability affects the `/api/trackedEntityInstances` and
`/api/trackedEntityInstances/query` API endpoints in all DHIS2
versions 2.34, 2.35, and 2.36. It also affects versions 2.32 and 2.33
which have reached _end of support_ - exceptional security updates
have been added to the latest *end of support* builds for these
versions. Versions 2.31 and older are unaffected. The system is
vulnerable to attack only from users that are logged in to DHIS2, and
there is no known way of exploiting the vulnerability without first
being logged in as a DHIS2 user. The vulnerability is not exposed to a
non-malicious user - the vulnerability requires a conscious attack to
be exploited. A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow
the malicious user to read, edit and delete data in the DHIS2
instance. There are no known exploits of the security vulnerabilities
addressed by these patch releases. Security patches are available in
DHIS2 versions 2.32-EOS, 2.33-EOS, 2.34.7, 2.35.7, and 2.36.4. There
is no straightforward known workaround for DHIS2 instances using the
Tracker functionality other than upgrading the affected DHIS2 server
to one of the patches in which this vulnerability has been fixed. For
implementations which do NOT use Tracker functionality, it may be
possible to block all network access to POST to the
`/api/trackedEntityInstances`, and `/api/trackedEntityInstances/query`
endpoints as a temporary workaround while waiting to upgrade.

OpenOLAT is a web-based learning management system (LMS). A path
traversal vulnerability exists in versions prior to 15.3.18, 15.5.3,
and 16.0.0. Using a specially prepared ZIP file, it is possible to
overwrite any file that is writable by the application server user
(e.g. the tomcat user). Depending on the configuration this can be
limited to files of the OpenOlat user data directory, however, if not
properly set up, the attack could also be used to overwrite
application server config files, java code or even operating system
files. The attack could be used to corrupt or modify any OpenOlat file
such as course structures, config files or temporary test data. Those
attack would require in-depth knowledge of the installation and thus
more theoretical. If the app server configuration allows the execution
of jsp files and the path to the context is known, it is also possible
to execute java code. If the app server runs with the same user that
is used to deploy the OpenOlat code or has write permissions on the
OpenOlat code files and the path to the context is know, code
injection is possible. The attack requires an OpenOlat user account to
upload a ZIP file and trigger the unzip method. It can not be
exploited by unregistered users. The problem is fixed in versions
15.3.18, 15.5.3 and 16.0.0. There are no known workarounds aside from
upgrading.

Electron is a framework for writing cross-platform desktop
applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. A vulnerability in
versions prior to 11.5.0, 12.1.0, and 13.3.0 allows a sandboxed
renderer to request a "thumbnail" image of an arbitrary file on the
user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts
of the original file, including textual data in many cases. Versions
15.0.0-alpha.10, 14.0.0, 13.3.0, 12.1.0, and 11.5.0 all contain a fix
for the vulnerability. Two workarounds aside from upgrading are
available. One may make the vulnerability significantly more difficult
for an attacker to exploit by enabling `contextIsolation` in one's
app. One may also disable the functionality of the
`createThumbnailFromPath` API if one does not need it.

Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. Prior to commit
number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26, a bug in `pallet-
ethereum` can cause invalid transactions to be included in the
Ethereum block state in `pallet-ethereum` due to not validating the
input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no
possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The
transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it
is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by
Substrate extrinsic size constraints. A patch is available in commit
number 0b962f218f0cdd796dadfe26c3f09e68f7861b26. There are no
workarounds aside from applying the patch.

default tagged polymorphism style. Applications using the property
polymorphism style are not affected. YAML input for a polymorphic type
that provided a tag but no value for the object would trigger the

pcapture is an open source dumpcap web service interface . In affected
versions this vulnerability allows an authenticated but unprivileged
user to use the REST API to capture and download packets with no
capture filter and without adequate permissions. This is important
because the capture filters can effectively limit the scope of
information that a user can see in the data captures. If no filter is
present, then all data on the local network segment where the program
is running can be captured and downloaded. v3.12 fixes this problem.
There is no workaround, you must upgrade to v3.12 or greater.

better_errors is an open source replacement for the standard Rails
error page with more information rich error pages. It is also usable
outside of Rails in any Rack app as Rack middleware. better_errors
prior to 2.8.0 did not implement CSRF protection for its internal
requests. It also did not enforce the correct "Content-Type" header
for these requests, which allowed a cross-origin "simple request" to
be made without CORS protection. These together left an application
with better_errors enabled open to cross-origin attacks. As a
developer tool, better_errors documentation strongly recommends
addition only to the `development` bundle group, so this vulnerability
should only affect development environments. Please ensure that your
project limits better_errors to the `development` group (or the non-
Rails equivalent). Starting with release 2.8.x, CSRF protection is
enforced. It is recommended that you upgrade to the latest release, or
minimally to "~> 2.8.3". There are no known workarounds to mitigate
the risk of using older releases of better_errors.

mentioned that it was safe by default. In practice the default was
never safe and had to be opted into. That is, user input was not
sanitized. This means arbitrary HTML can be passed through leading to
potential XSS attacks. The problem has been patched in 13.0.2 and
14.0.1: `remark-html` is now safe by default, and the implementation
matches the documentation. On older affected versions, pass `sanitize:

SharpCompress is a fully managed C# library to deal with many
compression types and formats. Versions prior to 0.29.0 are vulnerable
to partial path traversal. SharpCompress recreates a hierarchy of
directories under destinationDirectory if ExtractFullPath is set to
true in options. In order to prevent extraction outside the
destination directory the destinationFileName path is verified to
begin with fullDestinationDirectoryPath. However, prior to version
0.29.0, it is not enforced that fullDestinationDirectoryPath ends with
slash. If the destinationDirectory is not slash terminated like
`/home/user/dir` it is possible to create a file with a name thats
begins as the destination directory one level up from the directory,
i.e. `/home/user/dir.sh`. Because of the file name and destination
directory constraints the arbitrary file creation impact is limited
and depends on the use case. This issue is fixed in SharpCompress
version 0.29.0.

that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response
through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message
body. While a smuggled request is still captured as part of another
request's body, it does not appear in the request list and does not go
through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where users may have
implemented custom access control checks or input sanitization. Unless
one uses mitmproxy to protect an HTTP/1 service, no action is
required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy 7.0.3 and

from version 0.19.0 and before version 0.30.0 there was a use-after-
free bug when passing `externref`s from the host to guest Wasm
content. To trigger the bug, you have to explicitly pass multiple
`externref`s from the host to a Wasm instance at the same time, either
by passing multiple `externref`s as arguments from host code to a Wasm
function, or returning multiple `externref`s to Wasm from a multi-
value return function defined in the host. If you do not have host
code that matches one of these shapes, then you are not impacted. If
Wasmtime's `VMExternRefActivationsTable` became filled to capacity
after passing the first `externref` in, then passing in the second
`externref` could trigger a garbage collection. However the first
`externref` is not rooted until we pass control to Wasm, and therefore
could be reclaimed by the collector if nothing else was holding a
reference to it or otherwise keeping it alive. Then, when control was
passed to Wasm after the garbage collection, Wasm could use the first
`externref`, which at this point has already been freed. We have
reason to believe that the effective impact of this bug is relatively
small because usage of `externref` is currently quite rare. The bug
has been fixed, and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 0.30.0. If you
cannot upgrade Wasmtime yet, you can avoid the bug by disabling
reference types support in Wasmtime by passing `false` to
`wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types`.

Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. In Wasmtime
from version 0.26.0 and before version 0.30.0 is affected by a memory
unsoundness vulnerability. There was an invalid free and out-of-bounds
read and write bug when running Wasm that uses `externref`s in
Wasmtime. To trigger this bug, Wasmtime needs to be running Wasm that
uses `externref`s, the host creates non-null `externrefs`, Wasmtime
performs a garbage collection (GC), and there has to be a Wasm frame
on the stack that is at a GC safepoint where there are no live
references at this safepoint, and there is a safepoint with live
references earlier in this frame's function. Under this scenario,
Wasmtime would incorrectly use the GC stack map for the safepoint from
earlier in the function instead of the empty safepoint. This would
result in Wasmtime treating arbitrary stack slots as `externref`s that
needed to be rooted for GC. At the *next* GC, it would be determined
that nothing was referencing these bogus `externref`s (because nothing
could ever reference them, because they are not really `externref`s)
and then Wasmtime would deallocate them and run `<ExternRef as
Drop>::drop` on them. This results in a free of memory that is not
necessarily on the heap (and shouldn't be freed at this moment even if
it was), as well as potential out-of-bounds reads and writes. Even
though support for `externref`s (via the reference types proposal) is
enabled by default, unless you are creating non-null `externref`s in
your host code or explicitly triggering GCs, you cannot be affected by
this bug. We have reason to believe that the effective impact of this
bug is relatively small because usage of `externref` is currently
quite rare. This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to
Wasmtime version 0.30.0. If you cannot upgrade Wasmtime at this time,
you can avoid this bug by disabling the reference types proposal by
passing `false` to `wasmtime::Config::wasm_reference_types`.

Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. Wasmtime
before version 0.30.0 is affected by a type confusion vulnerability.
As a Rust library the `wasmtime` crate clearly marks which functions
are safe and which are `unsafe`, guaranteeing that if consumers never
use `unsafe` then it should not be possible to have memory unsafety
issues in their embeddings of Wasmtime. An issue was discovered in the
safe API of `Linker::func_*` APIs. These APIs were previously not
sound when one `Engine` was used to create the `Linker` and then a
different `Engine` was used to create a `Store` and then the `Linker`
was used to instantiate a module into that `Store`. Cross-`Engine`
usage of functions is not supported in Wasmtime and this can result in
type confusion of function pointers, resulting in being able to safely
call a function with the wrong type. Triggering this bug requires
using at least two `Engine` values in an embedding and then
additionally using two different values with a `Linker` (one at the
creation time of the `Linker` and another when instantiating a module
with the `Linker`). It's expected that usage of more-than-one `Engine`
in an embedding is relatively rare since an `Engine` is intended to be
a globally shared resource, so the expectation is that the impact of
this issue is relatively small. The fix implemented is to change this
behavior to `panic!()` in Rust instead of silently allowing it. Using
different `Engine` instances with a `Linker` is a programmer bug that
`wasmtime` catches at runtime. This bug has been patched and users
should upgrade to Wasmtime version 0.30.0. If you cannot upgrade
Wasmtime and are using more than one `Engine` in your embedding it's
recommended to instead use only one `Engine` for the entire program if
possible. An `Engine` is designed to be a globally shared resource
that is suitable to have only one for the lifetime of an entire
process. If using multiple `Engine`s is required then code should be
audited to ensure that `Linker` is only used with one `Engine`.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/05/4

Grafana is an open source data visualization platform. In affected
versions unauthenticated and authenticated users are able to view the
snapshot with the lowest database key by accessing the literal paths:
/dashboard/snapshot/:key, or /api/snapshots/:key. If the snapshot
"public_mode" configuration setting is set to true (vs default of
false), unauthenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the
lowest database key by accessing the literal path: /api/snapshots-
delete/:deleteKey. Regardless of the snapshot "public_mode" setting,
authenticated users are able to delete the snapshot with the lowest
database key by accessing the literal paths: /api/snapshots/:key, or
/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey. The combination of deletion and
viewing enables a complete walk through all snapshot data while
resulting in complete snapshot data loss. This issue has been resolved
in versions 8.1.6 and 7.5.11. If for some reason you cannot upgrade
you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to the literal
paths: /api/snapshots/:key, /api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey,
/dashboard/snapshot/:key, and /api/snapshots/:key. They have no normal
function and can be disabled without side effects.

Tremor is an event processing system for unstructured data. A
vulnerability exists between versions 0.7.2 and 0.11.6. This
vulnerability is a memory safety Issue when using `patch` or `merge`
on `state` and assign the result back to `state`. In this case,
affected versions of Tremor and the tremor-script crate maintains
references to memory that might have been freed already. And these
memory regions can be accessed by retrieving the `state`, e.g. send it
over TCP or HTTP. This requires the Tremor server (or any other
program using tremor-script) to execute a tremor-script script that
uses the mentioned language construct. The issue has been patched in
version 0.11.6 by removing the optimization and always cloning the
target expression of a Merge or Patch. If an upgrade is not possible,
a possible workaround is to avoid the optimization by introducing a
temporary variable and not immediately reassigning to `state`.

Rapid7 Insight Agent, versions 3.0.1 to 3.1.2.34, suffer from a local
privilege escalation due to an uncontrolled DLL search path.
Specifically, when Insight Agent versions 3.0.1 to 3.1.2.34 start, the
Python interpreter attempts to load python3.dll at
"C:\DLLs\python3.dll," which normally is writable by locally
authenticated users. Because of this, a malicious local user could use
Insight Agent's startup conditions to elevate to SYSTEM privileges.
This issue was fixed in Rapid7 Insight Agent 3.1.2.35. This
vulnerability is a regression of CVE-2019-5629.

A flaw was found in podman. The `podman machine` function (used to
create and manage Podman virtual machine containing a Podman process)
spawns a `gvproxy` process on the host system. The `gvproxy` API is
accessible on port 7777 on all IP addresses on the host. If that port
is open on the host's firewall, an attacker can potentially use the
`gvproxy` API to forward ports on the host to ports in the VM, making
private services on the VM accessible to the network. This issue could
be also used to interrupt the host's services by forwarding all ports
to the VM.

A local privilege escalation vulnerability was found on polkit's
pkexec utility. The pkexec application is a setuid tool designed to
allow unprivileged users to run commands as privileged users according
predefined policies. The current version of pkexec doesn't handle the
calling parameters count correctly and ends trying to execute
environment variables as commands. An attacker can leverage this by
crafting environment variables in such a way it'll induce pkexec to
execute arbitrary code. When successfully executed the attack can
cause a local privilege escalation given unprivileged users
administrative rights on the target machine.

A vulnerability was found in the fs/inode.c:inode_init_owner()
function logic of the LInux kernel that allows local users to create
files for the XFS file-system with an unintended group ownership and
with group execution and SGID permission bits set, in a scenario where
a directory is SGID and belongs to a certain group and is writable by
a user who is not a member of this group. This can lead to excessive
permissions granted in case when they should not. This vulnerability
is similar to the previous CVE-2018-13405 and adds the missed fix for
the XFS.

When parsing a file that is submitted to the DPDecoder service as a
job, the service will use the combination of decoding parameters that
were submitted with the job along with fields that were parsed for the
submitted video by the R3D SDK to calculate the size of a heap buffer.
Due to an integer overflow with regards to this calculation, this can
result in an undersized heap buffer being allocated. When this heap
buffer is written to, a heap-based buffer overflow will occur. This
can result in code execution under the context of the application.

Internally libssl in OpenSSL calls X509_verify_cert() on the client
side to verify a certificate supplied by a server. That function may
return a negative return value to indicate an internal error (for
example out of memory). Such a negative return value is mishandled by
OpenSSL and will cause an IO function (such as SSL_connect() or
SSL_do_handshake()) to not indicate success and a subsequent call to
SSL_get_error() to return the value SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY. This
return value is only supposed to be returned by OpenSSL if the
application has previously called SSL_CTX_set_cert_verify_callback().
Since most applications do not do this the SSL_ERROR_WANT_RETRY_VERIFY
return value from SSL_get_error() will be totally unexpected and
applications may not behave correctly as a result. The exact behaviour
will depend on the application but it could result in crashes,
infinite loops or other similar incorrect responses. This issue is
made more serious in combination with a separate bug in OpenSSL 3.0
that will cause X509_verify_cert() to indicate an internal error when
processing a certificate chain. This will occur where a certificate
does not include the Subject Alternative Name extension but where a
Certificate Authority has enforced name constraints. This issue can
occur even with valid chains. By combining the two issues an attacker
could induce incorrect, application dependent behaviour. Fixed in
OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0).

<p>Microsoft is investigating reports of a remote code execution
vulnerability in MSHTML that affects Microsoft Windows. Microsoft is
aware of targeted attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability
by using specially-crafted Microsoft Office documents.</p> <p>An
attacker could craft a malicious ActiveX control to be used by a
Microsoft Office document that hosts the browser rendering engine. The
attacker would then have to convince the user to open the malicious
document. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user
rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate
with administrative user rights.</p> <p>Microsoft Defender Antivirus
and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint both provide detection and
protections for the known vulnerability. Customers should keep
antimalware products up to date. Customers who utilize automatic
updates do not need to take additional action. Enterprise customers
who manage updates should select the detection build 1.349.22.0 or
newer and deploy it across their environments. Microsoft Defender for
Endpoint alerts will be displayed as: &#8220;Suspicious Cpl File
Execution&#8221;.</p> <p>Upon completion of this investigation, Microsoft
will take the appropriate action to help protect our customers. This
may include providing a security update through our monthly release
process or providing an out-of-cycle security update, depending on
customer needs.</p> <p>Please see the <strong>Mitigations</strong> and
<strong>Workaround</strong> sections for important information about
steps you can take to protect your system from this vulnerability.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> September 14, 2021: Microsoft has released
security updates to address this vulnerability. Please see the
Security Updates table for the applicable update for your system. We
recommend that you install these updates immediately. Please see the
FAQ for important information about which updates are applicable to
your system.</p>

A vulnerability has been identified in SAP SuccessFactors Mobile
Application for Android - versions older than 2108, which allows an
attacker to prevent legitimate users from accessing a service, either
by crashing or flooding the service, which can lead to denial of
service. The vulnerability is related to Android implementation
methods that are widely used across Android mobile applications, and
such methods are embedded into the SAP SuccessFactors mobile
application. These Android methods begin executing once the user
accesses their profile on the mobile application. While executing, it
can also pick up the activities from other Android applications that
are running in the background of the users device and are using the
same types of methods in the application. Such vulnerability can also
lead to phishing attacks that can be used for staging other types of
attacks.

An information disclosure vulnerability exists in SAP GUI for Windows
- versions < 7.60 PL13, 7.70 PL4, which allows an attacker with
sufficient privileges on the local client-side PC to obtain an
equivalent of the user&#8217;s password. With this highly sensitive data
leaked, the attacker would be able to logon to the backend system the
SAP GUI for Windows was connected to and launch further attacks
depending on the authorizations of the user.

In Contiki 3.0, Telnet option negotiation is mishandled. During
negotiation between a server and a client, the server may fail to give
the WILL/WONT or DO/DONT response for DO and WILL commands because of
improper handling of exception condition, which leads to property
violations and denial of service. Specifically, a server sometimes
sends no response, because a fixed buffer space is available for all
responses and that space may have been exhausted.

nLight ECLYPSE (nECY) system Controllers running software prior to
1.17.21245.754 contain a default key vulnerability. The nECY does not
force a change to the key upon the initial configuration of an
affected device. nECY system controllers utilize an encrypted channel
to secure SensorViewTM configuration and monitoring software and nECY
to nECY communications. Impacted devices are at risk of exploitation.
A remote attacker with IP access to an impacted device could submit
lighting control commands to the nECY by leveraging the default key. A
successful attack may result in the attacker gaining the ability to
modify lighting conditions or gain the ability to update the software
on lighting devices. The impacted key is referred to as the SensorView
Password in the nECY nLight Explorer Interface and the Gateway
Password in the SensorView application. An attacker cannot
authenticate to or modify the configuration or software of the nECY
system controller.

overriding it on Unix systems. TLS handshakes will thus succeed if the
peer can be verified either from the user-supplied CA or the system&#8217;s
default trust-store. Attackers with access to a host&#8217;s trust stores or
are able to compromise a certificate authority already in the host's
trust store (note: the attacker must also be able to spoof DNS in this
case) may be able to use this issue to bypass CA pinning. An attacker
could then spoof the MQTT broker, and either drop traffic and/or
respond with the attacker's data, but they would not be able to
forward this data on to the MQTT broker because the attacker would
still need the user's private keys to authenticate against the MQTT
broker. The 'aws_tls_ctx_options_override_default_trust_store_*'
function within the aws-c-io submodule has been updated to override
the default trust store. This corrects this issue. This issue affects:
Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for Java versions prior to
1.5.0 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS IoT Device SDK v2 for
Python versions prior to 1.6.1 on Linux/Unix. Amazon Web Services AWS

The update process of the Circle Parental Control Service on various
NETGEAR routers allows remote attackers to achieve remote code
execution as root via a MitM attack. While the parental controls
themselves are not enabled by default on the routers, the Circle
update daemon, circled, is enabled by default. This daemon connects to
Circle and NETGEAR to obtain version information and updates to the
circled daemon and its filtering database. However, database updates
from NETGEAR are unsigned and downloaded via cleartext HTTP. As such,
an attacker with the ability to perform a MitM attack on the device
can respond to circled update requests with a crafted, compressed
database file, the extraction of which gives the attacker the ability
to overwrite executable files with attacker-controlled code. This

Certain NETGEAR smart switches are affected by a remote admin password
change by an unauthenticated attacker via the (disabled by default)
/sqfs/bin/sccd daemon, which fails to check authentication when the
authentication TLV is missing from a received NSDP packet. This
affects GC108P before 1.0.8.2, GC108PP before 1.0.8.2, GS108Tv3 before
7.0.7.2, GS110TPP before 7.0.7.2, GS110TPv3 before 7.0.7.2, GS110TUP

Certain NETGEAR smart switches are affected by an authentication
hijacking race-condition vulnerability by an unauthenticated attacker
who uses the same source IP address as an admin in the process of
logging in (e.g., behind the same NAT device, or already in possession
of a foothold on an admin's machine). This occurs because the multi-
step HTTP authentication process is effectively tied only to the
source IP address. This affects GC108P before 1.0.8.2, GC108PP before
1.0.8.2, GS108Tv3 before 7.0.7.2, GS110TPP before 7.0.7.2, GS110TPv3

In Eclipse p2, installable units are able to alter the Eclipse
Platform installation and the local machine via touchpoints during
installation. Those touchpoints can, for example, alter the command-
line used to start the application, injecting things like agent or
other settings that usually require particular attention in term of
security. Although p2 has built-in strategies to ensure artifacts are
signed and then to help establish trust, there is no such strategy for
the metadata part that does configure such touchpoints. As a result,
it's possible to install a unit that will run malicious code during
installation without user receiving any warning about this
installation step being risky when coming from untrusted source.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/10/msg00017.html

squashfs_opendir in unsquash-2.c in Squashfs-Tools 4.5 allows
Directory Traversal, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-40153. A
squashfs filesystem that has been crafted to include a symbolic link
and then contents under the same filename in a filesystem can cause
unsquashfs to first create the symbolic link pointing outside the
expected directory, and then the subsequent write operation will cause
the unsquashfs process to write through the symbolic link elsewhere in
the filesystem.

The activation process in Travis CI, for certain 2021-09-03 through
2021-09-10 builds, causes secret data to have unexpected sharing that
is not specified by the customer-controlled .travis.yml file. In
particular, the desired behavior (if .travis.yml has been created
locally by a customer, and added to git) is for a Travis service to
perform builds in a way that prevents public access to customer-
specific secret environment data such as signing keys, access
credentials, and API tokens. However, during the stated 8-day
interval, secret data could be revealed to an unauthorized actor who
forked a public repository and printed files during a build process.

Dada Mail is a web-based e-mail list management system. In affected
versions a bad actor could give someone a carefully crafted web page
via email, SMS, etc, that - when visited, allows them control of the
list control panel as if the bad actor was logged in themselves. This
includes changing any mailing list password, as well as the Dada Mail
Root Password - which could effectively shut out actual list owners of
the mailing list and allow the bad actor complete and unfettered
control of your mailing list. This vulnerability also affects profile
logins. For this vulnerability to work, the target of the bad actor
would need to be logged into the list control panel themselves. This
CSRF vulnerability in Dada Mail affects all versions of Dada Mail
v11.15.1 and below. Although we know of no known CSRF exploits that
have happened in the wild, this vulnerability has been confirmed by
our testing, and by a third party. Users are advised to update to
version 11.16.0.

http4s is an open source scala interface for HTTP. In affected
versions http4s is vulnerable to response-splitting or request-
splitting attacks when untrusted user input is used to create any of
the following fields: Header names (`Header.name`), Header values
(`Header.value`), Status reason phrases (`Status.reason`), URI paths
(`Uri.Path`), URI authority registered names (`URI.RegName`) (through
0.21). This issue has been resolved in versions 0.21.30, 0.22.5,
0.23.4, and 1.0.0-M27 perform the following. As a matter of practice
http4s services and client applications should sanitize any user input
in the aforementioned fields before returning a request or response to
the backend. The carriage return, newline, and null characters are the
most threatening.

in-toto-golang is a go implementation of the in-toto framework to
protect software supply chain integrity. In affected versions
authenticated attackers posing as functionaries (i.e., within a
trusted set of users for a layout) are able to create attestations
that may bypass DISALLOW rules in the same layout. An attacker with
access to trusted private keys, may issue an attestation that contains
a disallowed artifact by including path traversal semantics (e.g., foo
vs dir/../foo). Exploiting this vulnerability is dependent on the
specific policy applied. The problem has been fixed in version 0.3.0.

Elvish is a programming language and interactive shell, combined into
one package. In versions prior to 0.14.0 Elvish's web UI backend
(started by `elvish -web`) hosts an endpoint that allows executing the
code sent from the web UI. The backend does not check the origin of
requests correctly. As a result, if the user has the web UI backend
open and visits a compromised or malicious website, the website can
send arbitrary code to the endpoint in localhost. All Elvish releases
from 0.14.0 onward no longer include the the web UI, although it is
still possible for the user to build a version from source that
includes the web UI. The issue can be patched for previous versions by
removing the web UI (found in web, pkg/web or pkg/prog/web, depending
on the exact version).

Grafana Agent is a telemetry collector for sending metrics, logs, and
trace data to the opinionated Grafana observability stack. Prior to
versions 0.20.1 and 0.21.2, inline secrets defined within a metrics
instance config are exposed in plaintext over two endpoints: metrics
instance configs defined in the base YAML file are exposed at
`/-/config` and metrics instance configs defined for the scraping
service are exposed at `/agent/api/v1/configs/:key`. Inline secrets
will be exposed to anyone being able to reach these endpoints. If
HTTPS with client authentication is not configured, these endpoints
are accessible to unauthenticated users. Secrets found in these
sections are used for delivering metrics to a Prometheus Remote Write
system, authenticating against a system for discovering Prometheus
targets, and authenticating against a system for collecting metrics.
This does not apply for non-inlined secrets, such as `*_file` based
secrets. This issue is patched in Grafana Agent versions 0.20.1 and
0.21.2. A few workarounds are available. Users who cannot upgrade
should use non-inline secrets where possible. Users may also desire to
restrict API access to Grafana Agent with some combination of
restricting the network interfaces Grafana Agent listens on through
`http_listen_address` in the `server` block, configuring Grafana Agent
to use HTTPS with client authentication, and/or using firewall rules
to restrict external access to Grafana Agent's API.

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software
containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where the
data directory (typically `/var/lib/docker`) contained subdirectories
with insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise
unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute
programs. When containers included executable programs with extended
permission bits (such as `setuid`), unprivileged Linux users could
discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged
Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a
container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover,
read, and modify those files. This bug has been fixed in Moby (Docker
Engine) 20.10.9. Users should update to this version as soon as
possible. Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the
permissions to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade limit access to
the host to trusted users. Limit access to host volumes to trusted
containers.

Wire is an open source secure messenger. In affected versions if the
an attacker gets an old but valid access token they can take over an
account by changing the email. This issue has been resolved in version
3.86 which uses a new endpoint which additionally requires an
authentication cookie. See wire-ios-sync-engine and wire-ios-transport
references. This is the root advisory that pulls the changes together.

Wire is an open source secure messenger. Users of Wire by Bund may
bypass the mandatory encryption at rest feature by simply disabling
their device passcode. Upon launching, the app will attempt to enable
encryption at rest by generating encryption keys via the Secure
Enclave, however it will fail silently if no device passcode is set.
The user has no indication that encryption at rest is not active since
the feature is hidden to them. This issue has been resolved in version
3.70

Discourse is an open source discussion platform. There is a cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability in versions 2.7.7 and earlier of the
`stable` branch, versions 2.8.0.beta6 and earlier of the `beta`
branch, and versions 2.8.0.beta6 and earlier of the `tests-passed`
branch. Rendering of some error messages that contain user input can
be susceptible to XSS attacks. This vulnerability only affects sites
which have blocked watched words that contain HTML tags, modified or
disabled Discourse's default Content Security Policy. This issue is
patched in the latest `stable`, `beta` and `tests-passed` versions of
Discourse. As a workaround, avoid modifying or disabling Discourse&#8217;s
default Content Security Policy, and blocking watched words containing
HTML tags.

Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An
integer overflow bug in the underlying string library can be used to
corrupt the heap and potentially result with denial of service or
remote code execution. The vulnerability involves changing the default
proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter to a very large value and
constructing specially crafted network payloads or commands. The
problem is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An
additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
redis-server executable is to prevent users from modifying the proto-
max-bulk-len configuration parameter. This can be done using ACL to
restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.

Wire-server is the backing server for the open source wire secure
messaging application. In affected versions it is possible to trigger
email address change of a user with only the short-lived session token
in the `Authorization` header. As the short-lived token is only meant
as means of authentication by the client for less critical requests to
the backend, the ability to change the email address with a short-
lived token constitutes a privilege escalation attack. Since the
attacker can change the password after setting the email address to
one that they control, changing the email address can result in an
account takeover by the attacker. Short-lived tokens can be requested
from the backend by Wire clients using the long lived tokens, after
which the long lived tokens can be stored securely, for example on the
devices key chain. The short lived tokens can then be used to
authenticate the client towards the backend for frequently performed
actions such as sending and receiving messages. While short-lived
tokens should not be available to an attacker per-se, they are used
more often and in the shape of an HTTP header, increasing the risk of
exposure to an attacker relative to the long-lived tokens, which are
stored and transmitted in cookies. If you are running an on-prem
instance and provision all users with SCIM, you are not affected by
this issue (changing email is blocked for SCIM users). SAML single-
sign-on is unaffected by this issue, and behaves identically before
and after this update. The reason is that the email address used as
SAML NameID is stored in a different location in the databse from the
one used to contact the user outside wire. Version 2021-08-16 and
later provide a new end-point that requires both the long-lived client
cookie and `Authorization` header. The old end-point has been removed.
If you are running an on-prem instance with at least some of the users
invited or provisioned via SAML SSO and you cannot update then you can
block `/self/email` on nginz (or in any other proxies or firewalls you
may have set up). You don't need to discriminate by verb:
`/self/email` only accepts `PUT` and `DELETE`, and `DELETE` is almost
never used.

wire-server is an open-source back end for Wire, a secure
collaboration platform. Before version 2.106.0, the CORS ` Access-
Control-Allow-Origin ` header set by `nginz` is set for all subdomains
of `.wire.com` (including `wire.com`). This means that if somebody
were to find an XSS vector in any of the subdomains, they could use it
to talk to the Wire API using the user's Cookie. A patch does not
exist, but a workaround does. To make sure that a compromise of one
subdomain does not yield access to the cookie of another, one may
limit the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to apps that actually
require the cookie (account-pages, team-settings and the webapp).

containerd is an open source container runtime with an emphasis on
simplicity, robustness and portability. A bug was found in containerd
where container root directories and some plugins had insufficiently
restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to
traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers
included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as
setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those
programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host
collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the
unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify
those files. This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11
and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update to these version when they
are released and may restart containers or update directory
permissions to mitigate the vulnerability. Users unable to update
should limit access to the host to trusted users. Update directory
permission on container bundles directories.

FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital
transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software
implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. When handling SRTP
calls, FreeSWITCH prior to version 1.10.7 is susceptible to a DoS
where calls can be terminated by remote attackers. This attack can be
done continuously, thus denying encrypted calls during the attack.
When a media port that is handling SRTP traffic is flooded with a
specially crafted SRTP packet, the call is terminated leading to
denial of service. This issue was reproduced when using the SDES key
exchange mechanism in a SIP environment as well as when using the DTLS
key exchange mechanism in a WebRTC environment. The call disconnection
occurs due to line 6331 in the source file `switch_rtp.c`, which
disconnects the call when the total number of SRTP errors reach a
hard-coded threshold (100). By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker
is able to disconnect any ongoing calls that are using SRTP. The
attack does not require authentication or any special foothold in the
caller's or the callee's network. This issue is patched in version
1.10.7.

JWT is a library to work with JSON Web Token and JSON Web Signature.
Prior to versions 3.4.6, 4.0.4, and 4.1.5, users of HMAC-based
algorithms (HS256, HS384, and HS512) combined with
`Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\LocalFileReference` as key are having their
tokens issued/validated using the file path as hashing key - instead
of the contents. The HMAC hashing functions take any string as input
and, since users can issue and validate tokens, users are lead to
believe that everything works properly. Versions 3.4.6, 4.0.4, and
4.1.5 have been patched to always load the file contents, deprecated
the `Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\LocalFileReference`, and suggest
`Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\InMemory` as the alternative. As a
workaround, use `Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\InMemory` instead of
`Lcobucci\JWT\Signer\Key\LocalFileReference` to create the instances
of one's keys.

regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the
response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user

LiveQuery payload. A patch in version 4.10.4 removes session tokens
from the LiveQuery payload. As a workaround, set `user.acl(new
Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already

TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system
released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that the new TYPO3
v11 feature that allows users to create and share deep links in the
backend user interface is vulnerable to cross-site-request-forgery.
The impact is the same as described in TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-006
(CVE-2020-11069). However, it is not limited to the same site context
and does not require the attacker to be authenticated. In a worst case
scenario, the attacker could create a new admin user account to
compromise the system. To successfully carry out an attack, an
attacker must trick his victim to access a compromised system. The
victim must have an active session in the TYPO3 backend at that time.
The following Same-Site cookie settings in
$GLOBALS[TYPO3_CONF_VARS][BE][cookieSameSite] are required for an
attack to be successful: SameSite=strict: malicious evil.example.org
invoking TYPO3 application at good.example.org and SameSite=lax or
none: malicious evil.com invoking TYPO3 application at example.org.
Update your instance to TYPO3 version 11.5.0 which addresses the
problem described.

TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system
released under the GNU GPL. It has been discovered that TYPO3 CMS is
susceptible to host spoofing due to improper validation of the HTTP
Host header. TYPO3 uses the HTTP Host header, for example, to generate
absolute URLs during the frontend rendering process. Since the host
header itself is provided by the client, it can be forged to any
value, even in a name-based virtual hosts environment. This
vulnerability is the same as described in TYPO3-CORE-SA-2014-001
(CVE-2014-3941). A regression, introduced during TYPO3 v11
development, led to this situation. The already existing setting
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['SYS']['trustedHostsPattern'] (used as an
effective mitigation strategy in previous TYPO3 versions) was not
evaluated anymore, and reintroduced the vulnerability.

Zulip is an open source team chat server. In affected versions Zulip
allows organization administrators on a server to configure
"linkifiers" that automatically create links from messages that users
send, detected via arbitrary regular expressions. Malicious
organization administrators could subject the server to a denial-of-
service via regular expression complexity attacks; most simply, by
configuring a quadratic-time regular expression in a linkifier, and
sending messages that exploited it. A regular expression attempted to
parse the user-provided regexes to verify that they were safe from
ReDoS -- this was both insufficient, as well as _itself_ subject to
ReDoS if the organization administrator entered a sufficiently complex
invalid regex. Affected users should [upgrade to the just-released
Zulip 4.7](https://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/production/upgrade-
or-modify.html#upgrading-to-a-release), or

keypair is a a RSA PEM key generator written in javascript. keypair
implements a lot of cryptographic primitives on its own or by
borrowing from other libraries where possible, including node-forge.
An issue was discovered where this library was generating identical
RSA keys used in SSH. This would mean that the library is generating
identical P, Q (and thus N) values which, in practical terms, is
impossible with RSA-2048 keys. Generating identical values,
repeatedly, usually indicates an issue with poor random number
generation, or, poor handling of CSPRNG output. Issue 1: Poor random
number generation (`GHSL-2021-1012`). The library does not rely
entirely on a platform provided CSPRNG, rather, it uses it's own
counter-based CMAC approach. Where things go wrong is seeding the CMAC
implementation with "true" random data in the function
`defaultSeedFile`. In order to seed the AES-CMAC generator, the
library will take two different approaches depending on the JavaScript
execution environment. In a browser, the library will use [`window.cry
pto.getRandomValues()`](https://github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/8
7c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82af80be6db/index.js#L971). However, in a
nodeJS execution environment, the `window` object is not defined, so
it goes down a much less secure solution, also of which has a bug in
it. It does look like the library tries to use node's CSPRNG when
possible unfortunately, it looks like the `crypto` object is null
because a variable was declared with the same name, and set to `null`.
So the node CSPRNG path is never taken. However, when
`window.crypto.getRandomValues()` is not available, a Lehmer LCG
random number generator is used to seed the CMAC counter, and the LCG
is seeded with `Math.random`. While this is poor and would likely
qualify in a security bug in itself, it does not explain the extreme
frequency in which duplicate keys occur. The main flaw: The output
from the Lehmer LCG is encoded incorrectly. The specific [line][https:
//github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82
af80be6db/index.js#L1008] with the flaw is:
`b.putByte(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))` The [definition](https:/
/github.com/juliangruber/keypair/blob/87c62f255baa12c1ec4f98a91600f82a
f80be6db/index.js#L350-L352) of `putByte` is
`util.ByteBuffer.prototype.putByte = function(b) {this.data +=
String.fromCharCode(b);};`. Simplified, this is
`String.fromCharCode(String.fromCharCode(next & 0xFF))`. The double
`String.fromCharCode` is almost certainly unintentional and the source
of weak seeding. Unfortunately, this does not result in an error.
Rather, it results most of the buffer containing zeros. Since we are
masking with 0xFF, we can determine that 97% of the output from the
LCG are converted to zeros. The only outputs that result in meaningful
values are outputs 48 through 57, inclusive. The impact is that each
byte in the RNG seed has a 97% chance of being 0 due to incorrect
conversion. When it is not, the bytes are 0 through 9. In summary,
there are three immediate concerns: 1. The library has an insecure
random number fallback path. Ideally the library would require a
strong CSPRNG instead of attempting to use a LCG and `Math.random`. 2.
The library does not correctly use a strong random number generator
when run in NodeJS, even though a strong CSPRNG is available. 3. The
fallback path has an issue in the implementation where a majority of
the seed data is going to effectively be zero. Due to the poor random
number generation, keypair generates RSA keys that are relatively easy
to guess. This could enable an attacker to decrypt confidential
messages or gain authorized access to an account belonging to the
victim.

sylius/paypal-plugin is a paypal plugin for the Sylius development
platform. In affected versions the URL to the payment page done after
checkout was created with autoincremented payment id (/pay-with-
paypal/{id}) and therefore it was easy to predict. The problem is that
the Credit card form has prefilled "credit card holder" field with the
Customer's first and last name and hence this can lead to personally
identifiable information exposure. Additionally, the mentioned form
did not require authentication. The problem has been patched in
Sylius/PayPalPlugin 1.2.4 and 1.3.1. If users are unable to update
they can override a sylius_paypal_plugin_pay_with_paypal_form route
and change its URL parameters to (for example)
{orderToken}/{paymentId}, then override the
Sylius\PayPalPlugin\Controller\PayWithPayPalFormAction service, to
operate on the payment taken from the repository by these 2 values. It
would also require usage of custom repository method. Additionally,
one could override the @SyliusPayPalPlugin/payWithPaypal.html.twig
template, to add contingencies: ['SCA_ALWAYS'] line in
hostedFields.submit(...) function call (line 421). It would then have
to be handled in the function callback.

Hygeia is an application for collecting and processing personal and
case data in connection with communicable diseases. In affected
versions all CSV Exports (Statistics & BAG MED) contain a CSV
Injection Vulnerability. Users of the system are able to submit
formula as exported fields which then get executed upon ingestion of
the exported file. There is no validation or sanitization of these
formula fields and so malicious may construct malicious code. This
vulnerability has been resolved in version 1.30.4. There are no
workarounds and all users are advised to upgrade their package.

Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with
PHP 7, React, and Go. A malicious user can modify the contents of a
`confirmation_token` input during the two-factor authentication
process to reference a cache value not associated with the login
attempt. In rare cases this can allow a malicious actor to
authenticate as a random user in the Panel. The malicious user must
target an account with two-factor authentication enabled, and then
must provide a correct two-factor authentication token before being
authenticated as that user. Due to a validation flaw in the logic
handling user authentication during the two-factor authentication
process a malicious user can trick the system into loading credentials
for an arbitrary user by modifying the token sent to the server. This
authentication flaw is present in the
`LoginCheckpointController@__invoke` method which handles two-factor
authentication for a user. This controller looks for a request input
parameter called `confirmation_token` which is expected to be a 64
character random alpha-numeric string that references a value within
the Panel's cache containing a `user_id` value. This value is then
used to fetch the user that attempted to login, and lookup their two-
factor authentication token. Due to the design of this system, any
element in the cache that contains only digits could be referenced by
a malicious user, and whatever value is stored at that position would
be used as the `user_id`. There are a few different areas of the Panel
that store values into the cache that are integers, and a user who
determines what those cache keys are could pass one of those keys
which would cause this code pathway to reference an arbitrary user. At
its heart this is a high-risk login bypass vulnerability. However,
there are a few additional conditions that must be met in order for
this to be successfully executed, notably: 1.) The account referenced
by the malicious cache key must have two-factor authentication
enabled. An account without two-factor authentication would cause an
exception to be triggered by the authentication logic, thusly exiting
this authentication flow. 2.) Even if the malicious user is able to
reference a valid cache key that references a valid user account with
two-factor authentication, they must provide a valid two-factor
authentication token. However, due to the design of this endpoint once
a valid user account is found with two-factor authentication enabled
there is no rate-limiting present, thusly allowing an attacker to
brute force combinations until successful. This leads to a third
condition that must be met: 3.) For the duration of this attack
sequence the cache key being referenced must continue to exist with a
valid `user_id` value. Depending on the specific key being used for
this attack, this value may disappear quickly, or be changed by other
random user interactions on the Panel, outside the control of the
attacker. In order to mitigate this vulnerability the underlying
authentication logic was changed to use an encrypted session store
that the user is therefore unable to control the value of. This
completely removed the use of a user-controlled value being used. In
addition, the code was audited to ensure this type of vulnerability is
not present elsewhere.

Extensible Service Proxy, a.k.a. ESP is a proxy which enables API
management capabilities for JSON/REST or gRPC API services. ESPv1 can
be configured to authenticate a JWT token. Its verified JWT claim is
passed to the application by HTTP header "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo",
the application can use it to do authorization. But if there are two
"X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo" headers from the client, ESPv1 only replaces
the first one, the 2nd one will be passed to the application. An
attacker can send two "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo" headers, the second
one with a fake JWT claim. Application may use the fake JWT claim to
do the authorization. This impacts following ESPv1 usages: 1) Users
have configured ESPv1 to do JWT authentication with Google ID Token as
described in the referenced google endpoint document. 2) Users backend
application is using the info in the "X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo" header
to do the authorization. It has been fixed by v1.58.0. You need to
patch it in the following ways: * If your docker image is using tag
":1", needs to re-start the container to pick up the new version. The
tag ":1" will automatically point to the latest version. * If your
docker image tag pings to a specific minor version, e.g. ":1.57". You
need to update it to ":1.58" and re-start the container. There are no
workaround for this issue.

python-tuf is a Python reference implementation of The Update
Framework (TUF). In both clients (`tuf/client` and `tuf/ngclient`),
there is a path traversal vulnerability that in the worst case can
overwrite files ending in `.json` anywhere on the client system on a
call to `get_one_valid_targetinfo()`. It occurs because the rolename
is used to form the filename, and may contain path traversal
characters (ie `../../name.json`). The impact is mitigated by a few
facts: It only affects implementations that allow arbitrary rolename
selection for delegated targets metadata, The attack requires the
ability to A) insert new metadata for the path-traversing role and B)
get the role delegated by an existing targets metadata, The written
file content is heavily restricted since it needs to be a valid,
signed targets file. The file extension is always .json. A fix is
available in version 0.19 or newer. There are no workarounds that do
not require code changes. Clients can restrict the allowed character
set for rolenames, or they can store metadata in files named in a way
that is not vulnerable: neither of these approaches is possible
without modifying python-tuf.

Flatpak is a system for building, distributing, and running sandboxed
desktop applications on Linux. In versions prior to 1.10.4 and 1.12.0,
Flatpak apps with direct access to AF_UNIX sockets such as those used
by Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can trick portals and other
host-OS services into treating the Flatpak app as though it was an
ordinary, non-sandboxed host-OS process. They can do this by
manipulating the VFS using recent mount-related syscalls that are not
blocked by Flatpak's denylist seccomp filter, in order to substitute a
crafted `/.flatpak-info` or make that file disappear entirely. Flatpak
apps that act as clients for AF_UNIX sockets such as those used by
Wayland, Pipewire or pipewire-pulse can escalate the privileges that
the corresponding services will believe the Flatpak app has. Note that
protocols that operate entirely over the D-Bus session bus (user bus),
system bus or accessibility bus are not affected by this. This is due
to the use of a proxy process `xdg-dbus-proxy`, whose VFS cannot be
manipulated by the Flatpak app, when interacting with these buses.
Patches exist for versions 1.10.4 and 1.12.0, and as of time of
publication, a patch for version 1.8.2 is being planned. There are no
workarounds aside from upgrading to a patched version.

nbdime provides tools for diffing and merging of Jupyter Notebooks. In
affected versions a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue exists
within the Jupyter-owned nbdime project. It appears that when reading
the file name and path from disk, the extension does not sanitize the
string it constructs before returning it to be displayed. The
diffNotebookCheckpoint function within nbdime causes this issue. When
attempting to display the name of the local notebook
(diffNotebookCheckpoint), nbdime appears to simply append .ipynb to
the name of the input file. The NbdimeWidget is then created, and the
base string is passed through to the request API function. From there,
the frontend simply renders the HTML tag and anything along with it.
Users are advised to patch to the most recent version of the affected
product.

The Cosmos-SDK is a framework for building blockchain applications in
Golang. Affected versions of the SDK were vulnerable to a consensus
halt due to non-deterministic behaviour in a ValidateBasic method in
the x/authz module. The MsgGrant of the x/authz module contains a
Grant field which includes a user-defined expiration time for when the
authorization grant expires. In Grant.ValidateBasic(), that time is
compared to the node&#8217;s local clock time. Any chain running an affected
version of the SDK with the authz module enabled could be halted by
anyone with the ability to send transactions on that chain. Recovery
would require applying the patch and rolling back the latest block.
Users are advised to update to version 0.44.2.

Puma is a HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. Prior to
versions 5.5.1 and 4.3.9, using `puma` with a proxy which forwards
HTTP header values which contain the LF character could allow HTTP
request smugggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy,
causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client.
The only proxy which has this behavior, as far as the Puma team is
aware of, is Apache Traffic Server. If the proxy uses persistent
connections and the client adds another request in via HTTP
pipelining, the proxy may mistake it as the first request's body.
Puma, however, would see it as two requests, and when processing the
second request, send back a response that the proxy does not expect.
If the proxy has reused the persistent connection to Puma to send
another request for a different client, the second response from the
first client will be sent to the second client. This vulnerability was
patched in Puma 5.5.1 and 4.3.9. As a workaround, do not use Apache
Traffic Server with `puma`.

Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. In the newly
introduced signed Frontier-specific extrinsic for `pallet-ethereum`, a
large part of transaction validation logic was only called in
transaction pool validation, but not in block execution. Malicious
validators can take advantage of this to put invalid transactions into
a block. The attack is limited in that the signature is always
validated, and the majority of the validation is done again in the
subsequent `pallet-evm` execution logic. However, do note that a chain
ID replay attack was possible. In addition, spamming attacks are of
main concerns, while they are limited by Substrate block size limits
and other factors. The issue is patched in commit
`146bb48849e5393004be5c88beefe76fdf009aba`.

Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking
application written in PHP. When a logged on user selects a date in
Time Tracker, it is being passed on via the date parameter in URI.
Because of not checking this parameter for sanity in versions prior to
1.19.30.5600, it was possible to craft the URI with malicious
JavaScript, use social engineering to convince logged on user to click
on such link, and have the attacker-supplied JavaScript to be executed
in user's browser. This issue is patched in version 1.19.30.5600. As a
workaround, one may introduce `ttValidDbDateFormatDate` function as in
the latest version and add a call to it within the access checks block
in time.php.

FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital
transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software
implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. FreeSWITCH prior
to version 1.10.7 is susceptible to Denial of Service via SIP
flooding. When flooding FreeSWITCH with SIP messages, it was observed
that after a number of seconds the process was killed by the operating
system due to memory exhaustion. By abusing this vulnerability, an
attacker is able to crash any FreeSWITCH instance by flooding it with
SIP messages, leading to Denial of Service. The attack does not
require authentication and can be carried out over UDP, TCP or TLS.
This issue was patched in version 1.10.7.

qutebrowser is an open source keyboard-focused browser with a minimal
GUI. Starting with qutebrowser v1.7.0, the Windows installer for
qutebrowser registers a `qutebrowserurl:` URL handler. With certain
applications, opening a specially crafted `qutebrowserurl:...` URL can
lead to execution of qutebrowser commands, which in turn allows
arbitrary code execution via commands such as `:spawn` or `:debug-
pyeval`. Only Windows installs where qutebrowser is registered as URL
handler are affected. The issue has been fixed in qutebrowser v2.4.0.
The fix also adds additional hardening for potential similar issues on
Linux (by adding the new --untrusted-args flag to the .desktop file),
though no such vulnerabilities are known.

Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. In
affected versions A malicious actor could read sensitive files from
the environment where Scaffolder Tasks are run. The attack is executed
by crafting a custom Scaffolder template with a `github:publish:pull-
request` action and a particular source path. When the template is
executed the sensitive files would be included in the published pull
request. This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker
would need access to create and register templates in the Backstage
catalog, and that the attack is very visible given that the
exfiltration happens via a pull request. The vulnerability is patched
in the `0.15.9` release of `@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.

OpenOlat is a web-based e-learning platform for teaching, learning,
assessment and communication, an LMS, a learning management system. In
affected versions by manipulating the HTTP request an attacker can
modify the path of a requested file download in the folder component
to point to anywhere on the target system. The attack could be used to
read any file accessible in the web root folder or outside, depending
on the configuration of the system and the properly configured
permission of the application server user. The attack requires an
OpenOlat user account or the enabled guest user feature together with
the usage of the folder component in a course. The attack does not
allow writing of arbitrary files, it allows only reading of files and
also only ready of files that the attacker knows the exact path which
is very unlikely at least for OpenOlat data files. The problem is
fixed in version 15.5.8 and 16.0.1 It is advised to upgrade to version
16.0.x. There are no known workarounds to fix this problem, an upgrade
is necessary.

The evm crate is a pure Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual
Machine. In `evm` crate `< 0.31.0`, `JUMPI` opcode's condition is
checked after the destination validity check. However, according to
Geth and OpenEthereum, the condition check should happen before the
destination validity check. This is a **high** severity security
advisory if you use `evm` crate for Ethereum mainnet. In this case,
you should update your library dependency immediately to on or after
`0.31.0`. This is a **low** severity security advisory if you use
`evm` crate in Frontier or in a standalone blockchain, because there's
no security exploit possible with this advisory. It is **not**
recommended to update to on or after `0.31.0` until all the normal
chain upgrade preparations have been done. If you use Frontier or
other `pallet-evm` based Substrate blockchain, please ensure to update
your `spec_version` before updating this. For other blockchains,
please make sure to follow a hard-fork process before you update this.

FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital
transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software
implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. By default, SIP
requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected
versions of FreeSWITCH. Abuse of this security issue allows attackers
to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to
authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to
social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be
able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions. Although this
issue was fixed in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the
fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older version, may still be
vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. Software
upgrades do not update the configuration by default. SIP SUBSCRIBE
messages should be authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH
administrators do not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions`
parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter can
be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.

FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital
transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software
implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version
1.10.7, an attacker can perform a SIP digest leak attack against
FreeSWITCH and receive the challenge response of a gateway configured
on the FreeSWITCH server. This is done by challenging FreeSWITCH's SIP
requests with the realm set to that of the gateway, thus forcing
FreeSWITCH to respond with the challenge response which is based on
the password of that targeted gateway. Abuse of this vulnerability
allows attackers to potentially recover gateway passwords by
performing a fast offline password cracking attack on the challenge
response. The attacker does not require special network privileges,
such as the ability to sniff the FreeSWITCH's network traffic, to
exploit this issue. Instead, what is required for this attack to work
is the ability to cause the victim server to send SIP request messages
to the malicious party. Additionally, to exploit this issue, the
attacker needs to specify the correct realm which might in some cases
be considered secret. However, because many gateways are actually
public, this information can easily be retrieved. The vulnerability
appears to be due to the code which handles challenges in
`sofia_reg.c`, `sofia_reg_handle_sip_r_challenge()` which does not
check if the challenge is originating from the actual gateway. The
lack of these checks allows arbitrary UACs (and gateways) to challenge
any request sent by FreeSWITCH with the realm of the gateway being
targeted. This issue is patched in version 10.10.7. Maintainers
recommend that one should create an association between a SIP session
for each gateway and its realm to make a check be put into place for
this association when responding to challenges.

Snudown is a reddit-specific fork of the Sundown Markdown parser used
by GitHub, with Python integration added. In affected versions snudown
was found to be vulnerable to denial of service attacks to its
reference table implementation. References written in markdown `
[reference_name]: https://www.example.com` are inserted into a hash
table which was found to have a weak hash function, meaning that an
attacker can reliably generate a large number of collisions for it.
This makes the hash table vulnerable to a hash-collision DoS attack, a
type of algorithmic complexity attack. Further the hash table allowed
for duplicate entries resulting in long retrieval times. Proofs of
concept and further discussion of the hash collision issue are
discussed on the snudown GHSA(https://github.com/reddit/snudown/securi

neoan3-apps/template is a neoan3 minimal template engine. Versions
prior to 1.1.1 have allowed for passing in closures directly into the
template engine. As a result values that are callable are executed by
the template engine. The issue arises if a value has the same name as
a method or function in scope and can therefore be executed either by
mistake or maliciously. In theory all users of the package are
affected as long as they either deal with direct user input or
database values. A multi-step attack on is therefore plausible.
Version 1.1.1 has addressed this vulnerability. Unfortunately only
working with hardcoded values is safe in prior versions. As this
likely defeats the purpose of a template engine, please upgrade.

eLabFTW is an open source electronic lab notebook manager for research
teams. In versions of eLabFTW before 4.1.0, it allows attackers to
bypass a brute-force protection mechanism by using many different
forged PHPSESSID values in HTTP Cookie header. This issue has been
addressed by implementing brute force login protection, as recommended
by Owasp with Device Cookies. This mechanism will not impact users and
will effectively thwart any brute-force attempts at guessing
passwords. The only correct way to address this is to upgrade to
version 4.1.0. Adding rate limitation upstream of the eLabFTW service
is of course a valid option, with or without upgrading.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
In affected versions if an attacker is able to convince a victim to
visit a URL referencing a vulnerable page, arbitrary JavaScript
content may be executed within the context of the victim's browser.
The user visiting the malicious link must be unauthenticated and the
link must be for a page that contains the login button in the menu
bar. The url has to be crafted to exploit AngularJS rendering and
contain the interpolation binding for AngularJS expressions. AngularJS
uses double curly braces for interpolation binding: {{ }} ex:
{{constructor.constructor(&#8216;alert(1)&#8217;)()}}. When the user follows the
link and the page renders, the login button will contain the original
link with a query parameter to force a redirect to the login page. The
URL is not validated and the AngularJS rendering engine will execute
the JavaScript expression contained in the URL. Users are advised to
upgrade as soon as possible. If for some reason you cannot upgrade,
you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to block the
literal string {{ in the path.

Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with
PHP 7, React, and Go. In affected versions of Pterodactyl a malicious
user can trigger a user logout if a signed in user visits a malicious
website that makes a request to the Panel's sign-out endpoint. This
requires a targeted attack against a specific Panel instance, and
serves only to sign a user out. **No user details are leaked, nor is
any user data affected, this is simply an annoyance at worst.** This
is fixed in version 1.6.3.

Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. Prior
to versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, Nextcloud Server did not
implement a database backend for rate-limiting purposes. Any component
of Nextcloud using rate-limits (as as `AnonRateThrottle` or
`UserRateThrottle`) was thus not rate limited on instances not having
a memory cache backend configured. In the case of a default
installation, this would notably include the rate-limits on the two
factor codes. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server be upgraded
to 20.0.13, 21.0.5, or 22.2.0. As a workaround, enable a memory cache
backend in `config.php`.

Nextcloud is an open-source, self-hosted productivity platform. Prior
to versions 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0, a file traversal
vulnerability makes an attacker able to download arbitrary SVG images
from the host system, including user provided files. This could also
be leveraged into a XSS/phishing attack, an attacker could upload a
malicious SVG file that mimics the Nextcloud login form and send a
specially crafted link to victims. The XSS risk here is mitigated due
to the fact that Nextcloud employs a strict Content-Security-Policy
disallowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript. It is recommended that
the Nextcloud Server be upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5 or 22.2.0. There
are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.

Fluentd collects events from various data sources and writes them to
files to help unify logging infrastructure. The parser_apache2 plugin
in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression
denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a
certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular
expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack. This issue is
patched in version 1.14.2 There are two workarounds available. Either
don't use parser_apache2 for parsing logs (which cannot guarantee
generated by Apache), or put patched version of parser_apache2.rb into
/etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by
the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of
fluentd).

DHIS 2 is an information system for data capture, management,
validation, analytics and visualization. A SQL injection security
vulnerability has been found in specific versions of DHIS2. This
vulnerability affects the API endpoints for
/api/trackedEntityInstances and api/events in DHIS2. The system is
vulnerable to attack only from users that are logged in to DHIS2, and
there is no known way of exploiting the vulnerability without first
being logged in as a DHIS2 user. A successful exploit of this
vulnerability could allow the malicious user to read, edit and delete
data in the DHIS2 instance. There are no known exploits of the
security vulnerabilities addressed by these patch releases. However,
we strongly recommend that all DHIS2 implementations using versions
2.32, 2.33, 2.34, 2.35 and 2.36 install these patches as soon as
possible. There is no straightforward known workaround for DHIS2
instances using the Tracker functionality other than upgrading the
affected DHIS2 server to one of the patches in which this
vulnerability has been fixed. For implementations which do NOT use
Tracker functionality, it may be possible to block all network access
to POST to the /api/trackedEntityInstance and /api/events endpoints as
a temporary workaround while waiting to upgrade.

Shopware is open source e-commerce software. Versions prior to 5.7.6
contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability. This issue is patched in
version 5.7.6. Two workarounds are available. Using the security
plugin or adding a particular following config to the `.htaccess` file
will protect against cross-site scripting in this case. There is also
a config for those using nginx as a server. The plugin and the configs
can be found on the GitHub Security Advisory page for this
vulnerability.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20211119 CVE-2021-41190 OCI distribution and image spec: "content-type" confusion
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/11/19/10

The OCI Distribution Spec project defines an API protocol to
facilitate and standardize the distribution of content. In the OCI
Distribution Specification version 1.0.0 and prior, the Content-Type
header alone was used to determine the type of document during push
and pull operations. Documents that contain both &#8220;manifests&#8221; and
&#8220;layers&#8221; fields could be interpreted as either a manifest or an index
in the absence of an accompanying Content-Type header. If a Content-
Type header changed between two pulls of the same digest, a client may
interpret the resulting content differently. The OCI Distribution
Specification has been updated to require that a mediaType value
present in a manifest or index match the Content-Type header used
during the push and pull operations. Clients pulling from a registry
may distrust the Content-Type header and reject an ambiguous document
that contains both &#8220;manifests&#8221; and &#8220;layers&#8221; fields or &#8220;manifests&#8221; and
&#8220;config&#8221; fields if they are unable to update to version 1.0.1 of the
spec.

Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. If an admin
sets up Redash versions 10.0.0 and prior without explicitly specifying
the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` or `REDASH_SECRET_KEY` environment
variables, a default value is used for both that is the same across
all installations. In such cases, the instance is vulnerable to
attackers being able to forge sessions using the known default value.
This issue only affects installations where the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET
or REDASH_SECRET_KEY` environment variables have not been explicitly
set. This issue does not affect users of the official Redash cloud
images, Redash's Digital Ocean marketplace droplets, or the scripts in
the `getredash/setup` repository. These instances automatically
generate unique secret keys during installation. One can verify
whether one's instance is affected by checking the value of the
`REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` environment variable. If it is
`c292a0a3aa32397cdb050e233733900f`, should follow the steps to secure
the instance, outlined in the GitHub Security Advisory.

FirstUseAuthenticator is a JupyterHub authenticator that helps new
users set their password on their first login to JupyterHub. When
JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator, a vulnerability in
versions prior to 1.0.0 allows unauthorized access to any user's
account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed.
One may upgrade to version 1.0.0 or apply a patch manually to mitigate
the vulnerability. For those who cannot upgrade, there is no complete
workaround, but a partial mitigation exists. One can disable user
creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which
will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already
existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticator 1.0.0. If
any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e.
lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until a patch or upgrade
occurs.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In
affected versions the implementation of `tf.math.segment_*` operations
results in a `CHECK`-fail related abort (and denial of service) if a
segment id in `segment_ids` is large. This is similar to
CVE-2021-29584 (and similar other reported vulnerabilities in
TensorFlow, localized to specific APIs): the implementation (both on
CPU and GPU) computes the output shape using `AddDim`. However, if the
number of elements in the tensor overflows an `int64_t` value,
`AddDim` results in a `CHECK` failure which provokes a `std::abort`.
Instead, code should use `AddDimWithStatus`. The fix will be included
in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also
affected and still in supported range.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In
affected versions TensorFlow allows tensor to have a large number of
dimensions and each dimension can be as large as desired. However, the
total number of elements in a tensor must fit within an `int64_t`. If
an overflow occurs, `MultiplyWithoutOverflow` would return a negative
result. In the majority of TensorFlow codebase this then results in a
`CHECK`-failure. Newer constructs exist which return a `Status`
instead of crashing the binary. This is similar to CVE-2021-29584. The
fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In affeced
versions during execution, `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation()` is supposed
to set the flags in `input_has_ellipsis` vector and
`*output_has_ellipsis` boolean to indicate whether there is ellipsis
in the corresponding inputs and output. However, the code only changes

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In
affected versions while calculating the size of the output within the
`tf.range` kernel, there is a conditional statement of type `int64 =
condition ? int64 : double`. Due to C++ implicit conversion rules,
both branches of the condition will be cast to `double` and the result
would be truncated before the assignment. This result in overflows.
The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick
this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow

for the shapes of the tensor arguments involved in the call. Depending
on the API, this can result in undefined behavior and segfault or
`CHECK`-fail related crashes but in some scenarios writes and reads
from heap populated arrays are also possible. We have discovered these
issues internally via tooling while working on improving/testing GPU
op determinism. As such, we don't have reproducers and there will be
multiple fixes for these issues. These fixes will be included in
TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick these commits on TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In
affected versions the code for boosted trees in TensorFlow is still
missing validation. As a result, attackers can trigger denial of

as abuse undefined behavior (binding references to `nullptr`s). An
attacker can also read and write from heap buffers, depending on the
API that gets used and the arguments that are passed to the call.
Given that the boosted trees implementation in TensorFlow is

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In
affected versions the shape inference code for `QuantizeV2` can
trigger a read outside of bounds of heap allocated array. This occurs
whenever `axis` is a negative value less than `-1`. In this case, we

`axis` to be an optional argument (`s` would contain an
`error::NOT_FOUND` error code). Otherwise, it assumes that `axis` is a
valid index into the dimensions of the `input` tensor. If `axis` is

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In
affected versions the process of building the control flow graph for a
TensorFlow model is vulnerable to a null pointer exception when nodes
that should be paired are not. This occurs because the code assumes
that the first node in the pairing (e.g., an `Enter` node) always

vulnerable to undefined behavior via binding a reference to `nullptr`.
This occurs whenever the dimensions of `a` or `b` are 0 or less. In

allocated (to conserve the invariant that output tensors are always
allocated when the operation is successful) but nothing should be

device. An attacker with physical access to the medium, such as a
flash disk, could use this flaw to force a user into permanently
disabling the encryption layer of that medium.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. In
affected versions the async implementation of `CollectiveReduceV2`
suffers from a memory leak and a use after free. This occurs due to
the asynchronous computation and the fact that objects that have been
`std::move()`d from are still accessed. The fix will be included in
TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
2.6.1, as this version is the only one that is also affected.

Hangfire is an open source system to perform background job processing
in a .NET or .NET Core applications. No Windows Service or separate
process required. Dashboard UI in Hangfire.Core uses authorization
filters to protect it from showing sensitive data to unauthorized
users. By default when no custom authorization filters specified,
`LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter is being used to allow
only local requests and prohibit all the remote requests to provide
sensible, protected by default settings. However due to the recent
changes, in version 1.7.25 no authorization filters are used by
default, allowing remote requests to succeed. If you are using
`UseHangfireDashboard` method with default
`DashboardOptions.Authorization` property value, then your
installation is impacted. If any other authorization filter is
specified in the `DashboardOptions.Authorization` property, the you
are not impacted. Patched versions (1.7.26) are available both on
Nuget.org and as a tagged release on the github repo. Default
authorization rules now prohibit remote requests by default again by
including the `LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` filter to the
default settings. Please upgrade to the newest version in order to
mitigate the issue. For users who are unable to upgrade it is possible
to mitigate the issue by using the
`LocalRequestsOnlyAuthorizationFilter` explicitly when configuring the
Dashboard UI.

OpenOlat is a web-basedlearning management system. A path traversal
vulnerability exists in OpenOlat prior to versions 15.5.12 and 16.0.5.
By providing a filename that contains a relative path as a parameter
in some REST methods, it is possible to create directory structures
and write files anywhere on the target system. The attack could be
used to write files anywhere in the web root folder or outside,
depending on the configuration of the system and the properly
configured permission of the application server user. The attack
requires an OpenOlat user account, an enabled REST API and the rights
on a business object to call the vulnerable REST calls. The problem is
fixed in version 15.5.12 and 16.0.5. There is a workaround available.
The vulnerability requires the REST module to be enabled. Disabling
the REST module or limiting the REST module via some firewall or web-
server access rules to be accessed only be trusted systems will
mitigate the risk.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
In affected versions when the fine-grained access control beta feature
is enabled and there is more than one organization in the Grafana
instance admins are able to access users from other organizations.
Grafana 8.0 introduced a mechanism which allowed users with the
Organization Admin role to list, add, remove, and update users&#8217; roles
in other organizations in which they are not an admin. With fine-
grained access control enabled, organization admins can list, add,
remove and update users' roles in another organization, where they do
not have organization admin role. All installations between v8.0 and
v8.2.3 that have fine-grained access control beta enabled and more
than one organization should be upgraded as soon as possible. If you
cannot upgrade, you should turn off the fine-grained access control
using a feature flag.

JupyterHub is an open source multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks.
In affected versions users who have multiple JupyterLab tabs open in
the same browser session, may see incomplete logout from the single-
user server, as fresh credentials (for the single-user server only,
not the Hub) reinstated after logout, if another active JupyterLab
session is open while the logout takes place. Upgrade to JupyterHub
1.5. For distributed deployments, it is jupyterhub in the _user_
environment that needs patching. There are no patches necessary in the
Hub environment. The only workaround is to make sure that only one
JupyterLab tab is open when you log out.

GraphiQL is the reference implementation of this monorepo, GraphQL
IDE, an official project under the GraphQL Foundation. All versions of
graphiql older than graphiql@1.4.7 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP
schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious
GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can
allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the
attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in
graphiql. There are a number of ways that can occur. By default, the
schema URL is not attacker-controllable in graphiql or in its
suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex
attack vectors. If a custom implementation of graphiql's fetcher
allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query
parameter like ?endpoint= in graphql-playground, or a database
provided value, then this custom graphiql implementation is vulnerable
to phishing attacks, and thus much more readily available, low or no
privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic
looking graphql schema URL. It should be noted that desktop clients
such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by
this. This vulnerability does not impact codemirror-graphql, monaco-
graphql or other dependents, as it exists in onHasCompletion.ts in
graphiql. It does impact all forks of graphiql, and every released
version of graphiql.

GraphQL Playground is a GraphQL IDE for development of graphQL focused
applications. All versions of graphql-playground-react older than
graphql-playground-react@1.7.28 are vulnerable to compromised HTTP
schema introspection responses or schema prop values with malicious
GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can
allow code injection on operation autocomplete. In order for the
attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in
graphql-playground. There are several ways this can occur, including
by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the endpoint query
parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground
installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript
can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user
credentials or other harmful goals. If you are using graphql-
playground-react directly in your client app, upgrade to version
1.7.28 or later.

Kirby is an open source file structured CMS ### Impact Kirby's writer
field stores its formatted content as HTML code. Unlike with other
field types, it is not possible to escape HTML special characters
against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, otherwise the formatting
would be lost. If the user is logged in to the Panel, a harmful script
can for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions
of the victim. Because the writer field did not securely sanitize its
contents on save, it was possible to inject malicious HTML code into
the content file by sending it to Kirby's API directly without using
the Panel. This malicious HTML code would then be displayed on the
site frontend and executed in the browsers of site visitors and logged
in users who are browsing the site. Attackers must be in your group of
authenticated Panel users in order to exploit this weakness. Users who
do not make use of the writer field are not affected. This issue has
been patched in Kirby 3.5.8 by sanitizing all writer field contents on
the backend whenever the content is modified via Kirby's API. Please
update to this or a later version to fix the vulnerability.

Zydis is an x86/x86-64 disassembler library. Users of Zydis versions
v3.2.0 and older that use the string functions provided in `zycore` in
order to append untrusted user data to the formatter buffer within
their custom formatter hooks can run into heap buffer overflows. Older
versions of Zydis failed to properly initialize the string object
within the formatter buffer, forgetting to initialize a few fields,
leaving their value to chance. This could then in turn cause zycore
functions like `ZyanStringAppend` to make incorrect calculations for
the new target size, resulting in heap memory corruption. This does
not affect the regular uncustomized Zydis formatter, because Zydis
internally doesn't use the string functions in zycore that act upon
these fields. However, because the zycore string functions are the
intended way to work with the formatter buffer for users of the
library that wish to extend the formatter, we still consider this to
be a vulnerability in Zydis. This bug is patched starting in version
3.2.1. As a workaround, users may refrain from using zycore string
functions in their formatter hooks until updating to a patched
version.

kustomize-controller is a Kubernetes operator, specialized in running
continuous delivery pipelines for infrastructure and workloads defined
with Kubernetes manifests and assembled with Kustomize. Users that can
create Kubernetes Secrets, Service Accounts and Flux Kustomization
objects, could execute commands inside the kustomize-controller
container by embedding a shell script in a Kubernetes Secret. This can
be used to run `kubectl` commands under the Service Account of
kustomize-controller, thus allowing an authenticated Kubernetes user
to gain cluster admin privileges. In affected versions multitenant
environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Flux
Kustomization objects are affected by this issue. This vulnerability
was fixed in kustomize-controller v0.15.0 (included in flux2 v0.18.0)
released on 2021-10-08. Starting with v0.15, the kustomize-controller
no longer executes shell commands on the container OS and the
`kubectl` binary has been removed from the container image. To prevent
the creation of Kubernetes Service Accounts with `secrets` in
namespaces owned by tenants, a Kubernetes validation webhook such as
Gatekeeper OPA or Kyverno can be used.

Kirby is an open source file structured CMS. In affected versions
Kirby's blocks field stores structured data for each block. This data
is then used in block snippets to convert the blocks to HTML for use
in your templates. We recommend to escape HTML special characters to
protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. The default
snippet for the image block unfortunately did not use our escaping
helper. This made it possible to include malicious HTML code in the
source, alt and link fields of the image block, which would then be

rails_multisite provides multi-db support for Rails applications. In
affected versions this vulnerability impacts any Rails applications
using `rails_multisite` alongside Rails' signed/encrypted cookies.
Depending on how the application makes use of these cookies, it may be
possible for an attacker to re-use cookies on different 'sites' within
a multi-site Rails application. The issue has been patched in v4 of
the `rails_multisite` gem. Note that this upgrade will invalidate all
previous signed/encrypted cookies. The impact of this invalidation
will vary based on the application architecture.

Symfony/Http-Kernel is the HTTP kernel component for Symfony, a PHP
framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP
components. Headers that are not part of the "trusted_headers" allowed
list are ignored and protect users from "Cache poisoning" attacks. In
Symfony 5.2, maintainers added support for the `X-Forwarded-Prefix`
headers, but this header was accessible in SubRequest, even if it was
not part of the "trusted_headers" allowed list. An attacker could
leverage this opportunity to forge requests containing a `X-Forwarded-
Prefix` header, leading to a web cache poisoning issue. Versions
5.3.12 and later have a patch to ensure that the `X-Forwarded-Prefix`
header is not forwarded to subrequests when it is not trusted.

Symfony/SecurityBundle is the security system for Symfony, a PHP
framework for web and console applications and a set of reusable PHP
components. Since the rework of the Remember me cookie in version
5.3.0, the cookie is not invalidated when the user changes their
password. Attackers can therefore maintain their access to the account
even if the password is changed as long as they have had the chance to
login once and get a valid remember me cookie. Starting with version
5.3.12, Symfony makes the password part of the signature by default.
In that way, when the password changes, then the cookie is not valid
anymore.

Symfony/Serializer handles serializing and deserializing data
structures for Symfony, a PHP framework for web and console
applications and a set of reusable PHP components. Symfony versions
4.1.0 before 4.4.35 and versions 5.0.0 before 5.3.12 are vulnerable to
CSV injection, also known as formula injection. In Symfony 4.1,
maintainers added the opt-in `csv_escape_formulas` option in the
`CsvEncoder`, to prefix all cells starting with `=`, `+`, `-` or `@`
with a tab `\t`. Since then, OWASP added 2 chars in that list: Tab
(0x09) and Carriage return (0x0D). This makes the previous prefix char
(Tab `\t`) part of the vulnerable characters, and OWASP suggests using
the single quote `'` for prefixing the value. Starting with versions
4.4.34 and 5.3.12, Symfony now follows the OWASP recommendations and
uses the single quote `'` to prefix formulas and add the prefix to
cells starting by `\t`, `\r` as well as `=`, `+`, `-` and `@`.

Besu is an Ethereum client written in Java. Starting in version
21.10.0, changes in the implementation of the SHL, SHR, and SAR
operations resulted in the introduction of a signed type coercion
error in values that represent negative values for 32 bit signed
integers. Smart contracts that ask for shifts between approximately 2
billion and 4 billion bits (nonsensical but valid values for the
operation) will fail to execute and hence fail to validate. In
networks where vulnerable versions are mining with other clients or
non-vulnerable versions this will result in a fork and the relevant
transactions will not be included in the fork. In networks where
vulnerable versions are not mining (such as Rinkeby) no fork will
result and the validator nodes will stop accepting blocks. In networks
where only vulnerable versions are mining the relevant transaction
will not be included in any blocks. When the network adds a non-
vulnerable version the network will act as in the first case. Besu
21.10.2 contains a patch for this issue. Besu 21.7.4 is not vulnerable
and clients can roll back to that version. There is a workaround
available: Once a transaction with the relevant shift operations is
included in the canonical chain, the only remediation is to make sure
all nodes are on non-vulnerable versions.

Pterodactyl is an open-source game server management panel built with
PHP 7, React, and Go. Due to improperly configured CSRF protections on
two routes, a malicious user could execute a CSRF-based attack against
the following endpoints: Sending a test email and Generating a node
auto-deployment token. At no point would any data be exposed to the
malicious user, this would simply trigger email spam to an
administrative user, or generate a single auto-deployment token
unexpectedly. This token is not revealed to the malicious user, it is
simply created unexpectedly in the system. This has been addressed in
release `1.6.6`. Users may optionally manually apply the fixes
released in v1.6.6 to patch their own systems.

Functions SDK for EdgeX is meant to provide all the plumbing necessary
for developers to get started in processing/transforming/exporting
data out of the EdgeX IoT platform. In affected versions broken
encryption in app-functions-sdk &#8220;AES&#8221; transform in EdgeX Foundry
releases prior to Jakarta allows attackers to decrypt messages via
unspecified vectors. The app-functions-sdk exports an &#8220;aes&#8221; transform
that user scripts can optionally call to encrypt data in the
processing pipeline. No decrypt function is provided. Encryption is
not enabled by default, but if used, the level of protection may be
less than the user may expects due to a broken implementation. Version
v2.1.0 (EdgeX Foundry Jakarta release and later) of app-functions-sdk-
go/v2 deprecates the &#8220;aes&#8221; transform and provides an improved &#8220;aes256&#8221;
transform in its place. The broken implementation will remain in a
deprecated state until it is removed in the next EdgeX major release
to avoid breakage of existing software that depends on the broken

not invoked by default, users who do not use the AES transform in

Synapse is a package for Matrix homeservers written in Python
3/Twisted. Prior to version 1.47.1, Synapse instances with the media
repository enabled can be tricked into downloading a file from a
remote server into an arbitrary directory. No authentication is
required for the affected endpoint. The last 2 directories and file
name of the path are chosen randomly by Synapse and cannot be
controlled by an attacker, which limits the impact. Homeservers with
the media repository disabled are unaffected. Homeservers with a
federation whitelist are also unaffected, since Synapse will check the
remote hostname, including the trailing `../`s, against the whitelist.
Server administrators should upgrade to 1.47.1 or later. Server
administrators using a reverse proxy could, at the expense of losing
media functionality, may block the certain endpoints as a workaround.
Alternatively, non-containerized deployments can be adapted to use the
hardened systemd config.

diag_routes.php in pfSense 2.5.2 allows sed data injection.
Authenticated users are intended to be able to view data about the
routes set in the firewall. The data is retrieved by executing the
netstat utility, and then its output is parsed via the sed utility.
Although the common protection mechanisms against command injection
(i.e., the usage of the escapeshellarg function for the arguments) are
used, it is still possible to inject sed-specific code and write an
arbitrary file in an arbitrary location.

Ballistix MOD Utility through 2.0.2.5 is vulnerable to privilege
escalation in the MODAPI.sys driver component. The vulnerability is
triggered by sending a specific IOCTL request that allows low-
privileged users to directly interact with physical memory via the
MmMapIoSpace function call (mapping physical memory into a virtual
address space). Attackers could exploit this issue to achieve local
privilege escalation to NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM.

Omikron MultiCash Desktop 4.00.008.SP5 relies on a client-side
authentication mechanism. When a user logs into the application, the
validity of the password is checked locally. All communication to the
database backend is made via the same technical account. Consequently,
an attacker can attach a debugger to the process or create a patch
that manipulates the behavior of the login function. When the function
always returns the success value (corresponding to a correct
password), an attacker can login with any desired account, such as the
administrative account of the application.

Certain NETGEAR smart switches are affected by a \n injection in the
web UI's password field, which - due to several faulty aspects of the
authentication scheme - allows the attacker to create (or overwrite) a
file with specific content (e.g., the "2" string). This leads to admin
session crafting and therefore gaining full web UI admin privileges by
an unauthenticated attacker. This affects GC108P before 1.0.8.2,
GC108PP before 1.0.8.2, GS108Tv3 before 7.0.7.2, GS110TPP before
7.0.7.2, GS110TPv3 before 7.0.7.2, GS110TUP before 1.0.5.3, GS308T

** DISPUTED ** RealVNC Viewer 6.21.406 allows remote VNC servers to
cause a denial of service (application crash) via crafted RFB protocol
data. NOTE: It is asserted that this issue requires social engineering
a user into connecting to a fake VNC Server. The VNC Viewer
application they are using will then hang, until terminated, but no
memory leak occurs - the resources are freed once the hung process is
terminated and the resource usage is constant during the hang. Only
the process that is connected to the fake Server is affected. This is
an application bug, not a security issue.
