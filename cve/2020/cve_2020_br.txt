RobotsAndPencils go-saml, a SAML client library written in Go,
contains an authentication bypass vulnerability in all known versions.
This is due to how the `xmlsec1` command line tool is called
internally to verify the signature of SAML assertions. When `xmlsec1`
is used without defining the enabled key data, the origin of the
public key for the signature verification is, unfortunately, not
restricted. That means an attacker can sign the SAML assertions
themselves and provide the required public key (e.g. an RSA key)
directly embedded in the SAML token. Projects still using
RobotsAndPencils/go-saml should move to another SAML library or
alternatively remove support for SAML from their projects. The
vulnerability can likely temporarily be fixed by forking the go-saml
project and adding the command line argument `--enabled-key-data` and
specifying a value such as `x509` or `raw-x509-cert` when calling the
`xmlsec1` binary in the verify function. Please note that this
workaround must be carefully tested before it can be used.

Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform
built as a web application All users of Nautobot versions earlier than
1.6.6 or 2.0.5 are potentially affected by a cross-site scripting
vulnerability. Due to incorrect usage of Django's `mark_safe()` API
when rendering certain types of user-authored content; including
custom links, job buttons, and computed fields; it is possible that
users with permission to create or edit these types of content could
craft a malicious payload (such as JavaScript code) that would be
executed when rendering pages containing this content. The maintainers
have fixed the incorrect uses of `mark_safe()` (generally by replacing
them with appropriate use of `format_html()` instead) to prevent such
malicious data from being executed. Users on Nautobot 1.6.x LTM should
upgrade to v1.6.6 and users on Nautobot 2.0.x should upgrade to
v2.0.5. Appropriate object permissions can and should be applied to
restrict which users are permitted to create or edit the
aforementioned types of user-authored content. Other than that, there
is no direct workaround available.

Vim is a UNIX editor that, prior to version 9.0.2121, has a heap-use-
after-free vulnerability. When executing a `:s` command for the very
first time and using a sub-replace-special atom inside the
substitution part, it is possible that the recursive `:s` call causes
free-ing of memory which may later then be accessed by the initial
`:s` command. The user must intentionally execute the payload and the
whole process is a bit tricky to do since it seems to work only
reliably for the very first :s command. It may also cause a crash of
Vim. Version 9.0.2121 contains a fix for this issue.

google-translate-api-browser is an npm package which interfaces with
the google translate web api. A Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
Vulnerability is present in applications utilizing the `google-
translate-api-browser` package and exposing the `translateOptions` to
the end user. An attacker can set a malicious `tld`, causing the
application to return unsafe URLs pointing towards local resources.
The `translateOptions.tld` field is not properly sanitized before
being placed in the Google translate URL. This can allow an attacker
with control over the `translateOptions` to set the `tld` to a payload
such as `@127.0.0.1`. This causes the full URL to become
`https://translate.google.@127.0.0.1/...`, where `translate.google.`
is the username used to connect to localhost. An attacker can send
requests within internal networks and the local host. Should any HTTPS
application be present on the internal network with a vulnerability
exploitable via a GET call, then it would be possible to exploit this
using this vulnerability. This issue has been addressed in release
version 4.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/20/3

The SSH transport protocol with certain OpenSSH extensions, found in
OpenSSH before 9.6 and other products, allows remote attackers to
bypass integrity checks such that some packets are omitted (from the
extension negotiation message), and a client and server may
consequently end up with a connection for which some security features
have been downgraded or disabled, aka a Terrapin attack. This occurs
because the SSH Binary Packet Protocol (BPP), implemented by these
extensions, mishandles the handshake phase and mishandles use of
sequence numbers. For example, there is an effective attack against
SSH's use of ChaCha20-Poly1305 (and CBC with Encrypt-then-MAC). The
bypass occurs in chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com and (if CBC is used)
the -etm@openssh.com MAC algorithms. This also affects Maverick

The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs,
and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter
notebook, JupyterLab, and Voila. Unhandled errors in API requests
coming from an authenticated user include traceback information, which
can include path information. There is no known mechanism by which to
trigger these errors without authentication, so the paths revealed are
not considered particularly sensitive, given that the requesting user
has arbitrary execution permissions already in the same environment. A
fix has been introduced in commit `0056c3aa52` which no longer
includes traceback information in JSON error responses. For
compatibility, the traceback field is present, but always empty. This
commit has been included in version 2.11.2. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

xml-security is a library that implements XML signatures and
encryption. Validation of an XML signature requires verification that
the hash value of the related XML-document matches a specific
DigestValue-value, but also that the cryptographic signature on the
SignedInfo-tree (the one that contains the DigestValue) verifies and
matches a trusted public key. If an attacker somehow (i.e. by
exploiting a bug in PHP's canonicalization function) manages to
manipulate the canonicalized version's DigestValue, it would be
possible to forge the signature. This issue has been patched in
version 1.6.12 and 5.0.0-alpha.13.

incomplete as it enables an adversary to have a victim browser execute
malicious code when a victim user hovers their mouse over the
malicious data source path in `data_debug.php`. To perform the cross-

Jellyfin is a Free Software Media System for managing and streaming
media. In affected versions there is an argument injection in the
VideosController, specifically the `/Videos/<itemId>/stream` and
`/Videos/<itemId>/stream.<container>` endpoints which are present in
the current Jellyfin version. Additional endpoints in the
AudioController might also be vulnerable, as they differ only slightly
in execution. Those endpoints are reachable by an unauthenticated
user. In order to exploit this vulnerability an unauthenticated
attacker has to guess an itemId, which is a completely random GUID.
It&#8217;s a very unlikely case even for a large media database with lots of
items. Without an additional information leak, this vulnerability
shouldn&#8217;t be directly exploitable, even if the instance is reachable
from the Internet. There are a lot of query parameters that get
accepted by the method. At least two of those, videoCodec and
audioCodec are vulnerable to the argument injection. The values can be
traced through a lot of code and might be changed in the process.
However, the fallback is to always use them as-is, which means we can
inject our own arguments. Those arguments land in the command line of
FFmpeg. Because UseShellExecute is always set to false, we can&#8217;t
simply terminate the FFmpeg command and execute our own. It should
only be possible to add additional arguments to FFmpeg, which is
powerful enough as it stands. There is probably a way of overwriting
an arbitrary file with malicious content. This vulnerability has been
addressed in version 10.8.13. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Trusted Firmware-A (TF-A) before 2.10 has a potential read out-of-
bounds in the SDEI service. The input parameter passed in register x1
is not validated well enough in the function sdei_interrupt_bind. The
parameter is passed to a call to plat_ic_get_interrupt_type. It can be
any arbitrary value passing checks in the function plat_ic_is_sgi. A
compromised Normal World (Linux kernel) can enable a root-privileged
attacker to issue arbitrary SMC calls. Using this primitive, he can
control the content of registers x0 through x6, which are used to send
parameters to TF-A. Out-of-bounds addresses can be read in the context
of TF-A (EL3). Because the read value is never returned to non-secure
memory or in registers, no leak is possible. An attacker can still
crash TF-A, however.

Name: CVE-2023-49103
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://owncloud.com/security-advisories/disclosure-of-sensitive-credentials-and-configuration-in-containerized-deployments/
Reference: MISC:https://owncloud.org/security

An issue was discovered in ownCloud owncloud/graphapi 0.2.x before
0.2.1 and 0.3.x before 0.3.1. The graphapi app relies on a third-party
GetPhpInfo.php library that provides a URL. When this URL is accessed,
it reveals the configuration details of the PHP environment (phpinfo).
This information includes all the environment variables of the
webserver. In containerized deployments, these environment variables
may include sensitive data such as the ownCloud admin password, mail
server credentials, and license key. Simply disabling the graphapi app
does not eliminate the vulnerability. Additionally, phpinfo exposes
various other potentially sensitive configuration details that could
be exploited by an attacker to gather information about the system.
Therefore, even if ownCloud is not running in a containerized
environment, this vulnerability should still be a cause for concern.
Note that Docker containers from before February 2023 are not
vulnerable to the credential disclosure.

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched:
sch_qfq component can be exploited to achieve local privilege
escalation. When the plug qdisc is used as a class of the qfq qdisc,
sending network packets triggers use-after-free in qfq_dequeue() due
to the incorrect .peek handler of sch_plug and lack of error checking
in agg_dequeue(). We recommend upgrading past commit
8fc134fee27f2263988ae38920bc03da416b03d8.

XWiki Change Request is an XWiki application allowing to request
changes on a wiki without publishing directly the changes. Change
request allows to edit any page by default, and the changes are then
exported in an XML file that anyone can download. So it's possible for
an attacker to obtain password hash of users by performing an edit on
the user profiles and then downloading the XML file that has been
created. This is also true for any document that might contain
password field and that a user can view. This vulnerability impacts
all version of Change Request, but the impact depends on the rights
that has been set on the wiki since it requires for the user to have
the Change request right (allowed by default) and view rights on the
page to target. This issue cannot be easily exploited in an automated
way. The patch consists in denying to users the right of editing pages
that contains a password field with change request. It means that
already existing change request for those pages won't be removed by
the patch, administrators needs to take care of it. The patch is
provided in Change Request 1.10, administrators should upgrade
immediately. It's possible to workaround the vulnerability by denying
manually the Change request right on some spaces, such as XWiki space
which will include any user profile by default.

msgraph-sdk-php is the Microsoft Graph Library for PHP. The Microsoft
Graph PHP SDK published packages which contained test code that
enabled the use of the phpInfo() function from any application that
could access and execute the file at vendor/microsoft/microsoft-
graph/tests/GetPhpInfo.php. The phpInfo function exposes system
information. The vulnerability affects the GetPhpInfo.php script of
the PHP SDK which contains a call to the phpinfo() function. This
vulnerability requires a misconfiguration of the server to be present
so it can be exploited. For example, making the PHP application&#8217;s
/vendor directory web accessible. The combination of the vulnerability
and the server misconfiguration would allow an attacker to craft an
HTTP request that executes the phpinfo() method. The attacker would
then be able to get access to system information like configuration,
modules, and environment variables and later on use the compromised
secrets to access additional data. This problem has been patched in
versions 1.109.1 and 2.0.0-RC5. If an immediate deployment with the
updated vendor package is not available, you can perform the following
temporary workarounds: delete the `vendor/microsoft/microsoft-
graph/tests/GetPhpInfo.php` file, remove access to the `/vendor`
directory, or disable the phpinfo function.

microsoft-graph-core the Microsoft Graph Library for PHP. The
Microsoft Graph Beta PHP SDK published packages which contained test
code that enabled the use of the phpInfo() function from any
application that could access and execute the file at
`vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph-core/tests/GetPhpInfo.php`. The
phpInfo function exposes system information. The vulnerability affects
the GetPhpInfo.php script of the PHP SDK which contains a call to the
phpinfo() function. This vulnerability requires a misconfiguration of
the server to be present so it can be exploited. For example, making
the PHP application&#8217;s /vendor directory web accessible. The
combination of the vulnerability and the server misconfiguration would
allow an attacker to craft an HTTP request that executes the phpinfo()
method. The attacker would then be able to get access to system
information like configuration, modules, and environment variables and
later on use the compromised secrets to access additional data. This
problem has been patched in version 2.0.2. If an immediate deployment
with the updated vendor package is not available, you can perform the
following temporary workarounds: delete the
`vendor/microsoft/microsoft-graph-core/tests/GetPhpInfo.php` file,
remove access to the /vendor directory, or disable the phpinfo
function

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20231208 CVE-2023-49284: fish command substitution output can trigger shell expansion
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/08/1

fish is a smart and user-friendly command line shell for macOS, Linux,
and the rest of the family. fish shell uses certain Unicode non-
characters internally for marking wildcards and expansions. It will
incorrectly allow these markers to be read on command substitution
output, rather than transforming them into a safe internal
representation. While this may cause unexpected behavior with direct
input (for example, echo \UFDD2HOME has the same output as echo
$HOME), this may become a minor security problem if the output is
being fed from an external program into a command substitution where
this output may not be expected. This design flaw was introduced in
very early versions of fish, predating the version control system, and
is thought to be present in every version of fish released in the last
15 years or more, although with different characters. Code execution
does not appear to be possible, but denial of service (through large
brace expansion) or information disclosure (such as variable
expansion) is potentially possible under certain circumstances. fish
shell 3.6.2 has been released to correct this issue. Users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

lestrrat-go/jwx is a Go module implementing various JWx
(JWA/JWE/JWK/JWS/JWT, otherwise known as JOSE) technologies. A p2c
parameter set too high in JWE's algorithm PBES2-* could lead to a
denial of service. The JWE key management algorithms based on PBKDF2
require a JOSE Header Parameter called p2c (PBES2 Count). This
parameter dictates the number of PBKDF2 iterations needed to derive a
CEK wrapping key. Its primary purpose is to intentionally slow down
the key derivation function, making password brute-force and
dictionary attacks more resource- intensive. Therefore, if an attacker
sets the p2c parameter in JWE to a very large number, it can cause a
lot of computational consumption, resulting in a denial of service.
This vulnerability has been addressed in commit `64f2a229b` which has
been included in release version 1.2.27 and 2.0.18. Users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

tj-actions/branch-names is a Github action to retrieve branch or tag
names with support for all events. The `tj-actions/branch-names`
GitHub Actions improperly references the
`github.event.pull_request.head.ref` and `github.head_ref` context
variables within a GitHub Actions `run` step. The head ref variable is
the branch name and can be used to execute arbitrary code using a
specially crafted branch name. As a result an attacker can use this
vulnerability to steal secrets from or abuse `GITHUB_TOKEN`
permissions. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 7.0.7.
Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this

Vite is a website frontend framework. When Vite's HTML transformation
is invoked manually via `server.transformIndexHtml`, the original
request URL is passed in unmodified, and the `html` being transformed
contains inline module scripts (`<script type="module">...</script>`),
it is possible to inject arbitrary HTML into the transformed output by
supplying a malicious URL query string to `server.transformIndexHtml`.
Only apps using `appType: 'custom'` and using the default Vite HTML
middleware are affected. The HTML entry must also contain an inline
script. The attack requires a user to click on a malicious URL while
running the dev server. Restricted files aren't exposed to the
attacker. This issue has been addressed in vite@5.0.5, vite@4.5.1, and
vite@4.4.12. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

quic-go is an implementation of the QUIC protocol (RFC 9000, RFC 9001,
RFC 9002) in Go. An attacker can cause its peer to run out of memory
sending a large number of PATH_CHALLENGE frames. The receiver is
supposed to respond to each PATH_CHALLENGE frame with a PATH_RESPONSE
frame. The attacker can prevent the receiver from sending out (the
vast majority of) these PATH_RESPONSE frames by collapsing the peers
congestion window (by selectively acknowledging received packets) and
by manipulating the peer's RTT estimate. This vulnerability has been
patched in versions 0.37.7, 0.38.2 and 0.39.4.

of the ArduinoCreateAgent handles custom error messages. An attacker
that is able to persuade a victim into clicking on a malicious link
can perform a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting attack on the web
interface of the create agent, which would allow the attacker to
execute arbitrary browser client side code. Version 1.3.6 contains a
fix for the issue.

PyDrive2 is a wrapper library of google-api-python-client that
simplifies many common Google Drive API V2 tasks. Unsafe YAML
deserilization will result in arbitrary code execution. A maliciously
crafted YAML file can cause arbitrary code execution if PyDrive2 is
run in the same directory as it, or if it is loaded in via
`LoadSettingsFile`. This is a deserilization attack that will affect
any user who initializes GoogleAuth from this package while a
malicious yaml file is present in the same directory. This
vulnerability does not require the file to be directly loaded through
the code, only present. This issue has been addressed in commit
`c57355dc` which is included in release version `1.16.2`. Users are
advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

OpenZFS through 2.1.13 and 2.2.x through 2.2.1, in certain scenarios
involving applications that try to rely on efficient copying of file
data, can replace file contents with zero-valued bytes and thus
potentially disable security mechanisms. NOTE: this issue is not
always security related, but can be security related in realistic
situations. A possible example is cp, from a recent GNU Core Utilities
(coreutils) version, when attempting to preserve a rule set for
denying unauthorized access. (One might use cp when configuring access
control, such as with the /etc/hosts.deny file specified in the IBM
Support reference.) NOTE: this issue occurs less often in version
2.2.1, and in versions before 2.1.4, because of the default
configuration in those versions.

Reference: URL:https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2023-49783

Silverstripe Admin provides a basic management interface for the
Silverstripe Framework. In versions on the 1.x branch prior to 1.13.19
and on the 2.x branch prior to 2.1.8, users who don't have edit or
delete permissions for records exposed in a `ModelAdmin` can still
edit or delete records using the CSV import form, provided they have
create permissions. The likelihood of a user having create permissions
but not having edit or delete permissions is low, but it is possible.
Note that this doesn't affect any `ModelAdmin` which has had the
import form disabled via the `showImportForm` public property.
Versions 1.13.19 and 2.1.8 contain a patch for the issue. Those who
have a custom implementation of `BulkLoader` should update their
implementations to respect permissions when the return value of
`getCheckPermissions()` is true. Those who use any `BulkLoader` in
their own project logic, or maintain a module which uses it, should
consider passing `true` to `setCheckPermissions()` if the data is
provided by users.

NextChat, also known as ChatGPT-Next-Web, is a cross-platform chat
user interface for use with ChatGPT. Versions 2.11.2 and prior are
vulnerable to server-side request forgery and cross-site scripting.
This vulnerability enables read access to internal HTTP endpoints but
also write access using HTTP POST, PUT, and other methods. Attackers
can also use this vulnerability to mask their source IP by forwarding
malicious traffic intended for other Internet targets through these
open proxies. As of time of publication, no patch is available, but

the application to the public internet or, if exposing the application
to the internet, ensure it is an isolated network with no access to

Asterisk is an open source private branch exchange and telephony
toolkit. In Asterisk prior to versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, and 21.0.1; as
well as certified-asterisk prior to 18.9-cert6; Asterisk is
susceptible to a DoS due to a race condition in the hello handshake
phase of the DTLS protocol when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup.
This attack can be done continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP
encrypted calls during the attack. Abuse of this vulnerability may
lead to a massive Denial of Service on vulnerable Asterisk servers for
calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. Commit
d7d7764cb07c8a1872804321302ef93bf62cba05 contains a fix, which is part
of versions 18.20.1, 20.5.1, 21.0.1, amd 18.9-cert6.

PyInstaller bundles a Python application and all its dependencies into
a single package. A PyInstaller built application, elevated as a
privileged process, may be tricked by an unprivileged attacker into
deleting files the unprivileged user does not otherwise have access
to. A user is affected if **all** the following are satisfied: 1. The
user runs an application containing either `matplotlib` or `win32com`.
2. The application is ran as administrator (or at least a user with
higher privileges than the attacker). 3. The user's temporary
directory is not locked to that specific user (most likely due to
`TMP`/`TEMP` environment variables pointing to an unprotected,
arbitrary, non default location). Either: A. The attacker is able to
very carefully time the replacement of a temporary file with a
symlink. This switch must occur exactly between `shutil.rmtree()`'s
builtin symlink check and the deletion itself B: The application was
built with Python 3.7.x or earlier which has no protection against
Directory Junctions links. The vulnerability has been addressed in PR
#7827 which corresponds to `pyinstaller >= 5.13.1`. Users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. A
merge issue when porting the 5.0.1 patch to the 4.9 branch caused a
line duplication. In the version of `Multicall.sol` released in
`@openzeppelin/contracts@4.9.4` and `@openzeppelin/contracts-
upgradeable@4.9.4`, all subcalls are executed twice. Concretely, this
exposes a user to unintentionally duplicate operations like asset
transfers. The duplicated delegatecall was removed in version 4.9.5.
The 4.9.4 version is marked as deprecated. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

`nuxt-api-party` is an open source module to proxy API requests. nuxt-
api-party attempts to check if the user has passed an absolute URL to
prevent the aforementioned attack. This has been recently changed to
use the regular expression `^https?://`, however this regular
expression can be bypassed by an absolute URL with leading whitespace.
For example `\nhttps://whatever.com` which has a leading newline.
According to the fetch specification, before a fetch is made the URL
is normalized. "To normalize a byte sequence potentialValue, remove
any leading and trailing HTTP whitespace bytes from potentialValue.".
This means the final request will be normalized to
`https://whatever.com` bypassing the check and nuxt-api-party will
send a request outside of the whitelist. This could allow us to leak
credentials or perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF). This
vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are advised
to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should revert to the previous
method of detecting absolute URLs.

`nuxt-api-party` is an open source module to proxy API requests. The
library allows the user to send many options directly to `ofetch`.
There is no filter on which options are available. We can abuse the
retry logic to cause the server to crash from a stack overflow.
fetchOptions are obtained directly from the request body. A malicious
user can construct a URL known to not fetch successfully, then set the
retry attempts to a high value, this will cause a stack overflow as
ofetch error handling works recursively resulting in a denial of
service. This issue has been addressed in version 0.22.1. Users are
advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should limit ofetch
options.

@koa/cors npm provides Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) for koa, a
web framework for Node.js. Prior to version 5.0.0, the middleware
operates in a way that if an allowed origin is not provided, it will
return an `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header with the value of the
origin from the request. This behavior completely disables one of the
most crucial elements of browsers - the Same Origin Policy (SOP), this
could cause a very serious security threat to the users of this
middleware. If such behavior is expected, for instance, when
middleware is used exclusively for prototypes and not for production
applications, it should be heavily emphasized in the documentation
along with an indication of the risks associated with such behavior,
as many users may not be aware of it. Version 5.0.0 fixes this
vulnerability.

Uptime Kuma is an easy-to-use self-hosted monitoring tool. Prior to
version 1.23.9, when a user changes their login password in Uptime
Kuma, a previously logged-in user retains access without being logged
out. This behavior persists consistently, even after system restarts
or browser restarts. This vulnerability allows unauthorized access to
user accounts, compromising the security of sensitive information. The
same vulnerability was partially fixed in CVE-2023-44400, but logging
existing users out of their accounts was forgotten. To mitigate the
risks associated with this vulnerability, the maintainers made the
server emit a `refresh` event (clients handle this by reloading) and
then disconnecting all clients except the one initiating the password
change. It is recommended to update Uptime Kuma to version 1.23.9.

Uptime Kuma is an easy-to-use self-hosted monitoring tool. Prior to
version 1.23.9, the application uses WebSocket (with Socket.io), but
it does not verify that the source of communication is valid. This
allows third-party website to access the application on behalf of
their client. When connecting to the server using Socket.IO, the
server does not validate the `Origin` header leading to other site
being able to open connections to the server and communicate with it.
Other websites still need to authenticate to access most features,
however this can be used to circumvent firewall protections made in
place by people deploying the application. Without origin validation,
Javascript executed from another origin would be allowed to connect to
the application without any user interaction. Without login
credentials, such a connection is unable to access protected endpoints
containing sensitive data of the application. However, such a
connection may allow attacker to further exploit unseen
vulnerabilities of the application. Users with "No-auth" mode
configured who are relying on a reverse proxy or firewall to provide
protection to the application would be especially vulnerable as it
would grant the attacker full access to the application. In version
1.23.9, additional verification of the HTTP Origin header has been
added to the socket.io connection handler. By default, if the `Origin`
header is present, it would be checked against the Host header.
Connection would be denied if the hostnames do not match, which would
indicate that the request is cross-origin. Connection would be allowed
if the `Origin` header is not present. Users can override this
behavior by setting environment variable
`UPTIME_KUMA_WS_ORIGIN_CHECK=bypass`.

authorization to log in, and users would not manually input a
dangerous operation command. Therefore, the risk level of this
vulnerability is very low. Mitigation: all users should upgrade to
2.1.2 Example: ##You can customize the splicing method according to
the compilation situation of the project, mvn compilation results use

Reference: MISC:https://servicedesk.logpoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/14124495377437-Stored-XSS-Vulnerability-in-Alerts-via-Log-Injection

The Jinja templating in Logpoint SIEM 6.10.0 through 7.x before 7.3.0
does not correctly sanitize log data being displayed when using a
custom Jinja template in the Alert view. A remote attacker can craft a
cross-site scripting (XSS) payload and send it to any system or device
that sends logs to the SIEM. If an alert is created, the payload will
execute upon the alert data being viewed with that template, which can
lead to sensitive data disclosure.

h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3.
The QUIC stack (quicly), as used by H2O up to commit 43f86e5 (in
version 2.3.0-beta and prior), is susceptible to a state exhaustion
attack. When H2O is serving HTTP/3, a remote attacker can exploit this
vulnerability to progressively increase the memory retained by the
QUIC stack. This can eventually cause H2O to abort due to memory
exhaustion. The vulnerability has been resolved in commit
d67e81d03be12a9d53dc8271af6530f40164cd35. HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 are not
affected by this vulnerability as they do not use QUIC. Administrators
looking to mitigate this issue without upgrading can disable HTTP/3
support.

php-svg-lib is an SVG file parsing / rendering library. Prior to
version 0.5.1, when parsing the attributes passed to a `use` tag
inside an svg document, an attacker can cause the system to go to an
infinite recursion. Depending on the system configuration and attack
pattern this could exhaust the memory available to the executing
process and/or to the server itself. An attacker sending multiple
request to a system to render the above payload can potentially cause
resource exhaustion to the point that the system is unable to handle
incoming request. Version 0.5.1 contains a patch for this issue.

eProsima Fast DDS (formerly Fast RTPS) is a C++ implementation of the
Data Distribution Service standard of the Object Management Group.
Even with the application of SROS2, due to the issue where the data
(`p[UD]`) and `guid` values used to disconnect between nodes are not
encrypted, a vulnerability has been discovered where a malicious
attacker can forcibly disconnect a Subscriber and can deny a
Subscriber attempting to connect. Afterwards, if the attacker sends
the packet for disconnecting, which is data (`p[UD]`), to the Global
Data Space (`239.255.0.1:7400`) using the said Publisher ID, all the
Subscribers (Listeners) connected to the Publisher (Talker) will not
receive any data and their connection will be disconnected. Moreover,
if this disconnection packet is sent continuously, the Subscribers
(Listeners) trying to connect will not be able to do so. Since the
initial commit of the `SecurityManager.cpp` code (`init`,
`on_process_handshake`) on Nov 8, 2016, the Disconnect Vulnerability
in RTPS Packets Used by SROS2 has been present prior to versions
2.13.0, 2.12.2, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7.

Medusa is an automatic video library manager for TV shows. Versions
prior to 1.0.19 are vulnerable to unauthenticated blind server-side
request forgery (SSRF). The `testDiscord` request handler in
`medusa/server/web/home/handler.py` does not validate the user-
controlled `discord_webhook` variable and passes it to the
`notifiers.discord_notifier.test_notify` method, then
`_notify_discord` and finally `_send_discord_msg` method, which sends
a POST request to the user-controlled URL on line 64 in
`/medusa/notifiers/discord.py`, which leads to a blind server-side
request forgery. This issue allows for crafting POST requests on
behalf of the Medusa server. Version 1.0.19 contains a fix for the
issue.

Dompdf is an HTML to PDF converter for PHP. When parsing SVG images
Dompdf performs an initial validation to ensure that paths within the
SVG are allowed. One of the validations is that the SVG document does
not reference itself. However, prior to version 2.0.4, a recursive
chained using two or more SVG documents is not correctly validated.
Depending on the system configuration and attack pattern this could
exhaust the memory available to the executing process and/or to the
server itself. php-svg-lib, when run in isolation, does not support
SVG references for `image` elements. However, when used in combination
with Dompdf, php-svg-lib will process SVG images referenced by an
`image` element. Dompdf currently includes validation to prevent self-
referential `image` references, but a chained reference is not
checked. A malicious actor may thus trigger infinite recursion by
chaining references between two or more SVG images. When Dompdf parses
a malicious payload, it will crash due after exceeding the allowed
execution time or memory usage. An attacker sending multiple request
to a system can potentially cause resource exhaustion to the point
that the system is unable to handle incoming request. Version 2.0.4
contains a fix for this issue.

Nautobot is a Network Source of Truth and Network Automation Platform
built as a web application atop the Django Python framework with a
PostgreSQL or MySQL database. In Nautobot 1.x and 2.0.x prior to 1.6.7
and 2.0.6, the URLs `/files/get/?name=...` and
`/files/download/?name=...` are used to provide admin access to files
that have been uploaded as part of a run request for a Job that has
FileVar inputs. Under normal operation these files are ephemeral and
are deleted once the Job in question runs. In the default
implementation used in Nautobot, as provided by `django-db-file-
storage`, these URLs do not by default require any user authentication
to access; they should instead be restricted to only users who have
permissions to view Nautobot's `FileProxy` model instances. Note that
no URL mechanism is provided for listing or traversal of the available
file `name` values, so in practice an unauthenticated user would have
to guess names to discover arbitrary files for download, but if a user
knows the file name/path value, they can access it without
authenticating, so we are considering this a vulnerability. Fixes are
included in Nautobot 1.6.7 and Nautobot 2.0.6. No known workarounds
are available other than applying the patches included in those
versions.

Reference: URL:https://solr.apache.org/security.html#cve-2023-50290-apache-solr-allows-read-access-to-host-environment-variables

Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
vulnerability in Apache Solr. The Solr Metrics API publishes all
unprotected environment variables available to each Apache Solr
instance. Users are able to specify which environment variables to
hide, however, the default list is designed to work for known secret
Java system properties. Environment variables cannot be strictly
defined in Solr, like Java system properties can be, and may be set
for the entire host, unlike Java system properties which are set per-
Java-proccess. The Solr Metrics API is protected by the "metrics-read"
permission. Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization setup will only
be vulnerable via users with the "metrics-read" permission. This issue
affects Apache Solr: from 9.0.0 before 9.3.0. Users are recommended to
upgrade to version 9.3.0 or later, in which environment variables are
not published via the Metrics API.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/09/4

Insufficiently Protected Credentials vulnerability in Apache Solr.
This issue affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0
before 9.3.0. One of the two endpoints that publishes the Solr
process' Java system properties, /admin/info/properties, was only
setup to hide system properties that had "password" contained in the
name. There are a number of sensitive system properties, such as
"basicauth" and "aws.secretKey" do not contain "password", thus their
values were published via the "/admin/info/properties" endpoint. This
endpoint populates the list of System Properties on the home screen of
the Solr Admin page, making the exposed credentials visible in the UI.
This /admin/info/properties endpoint is protected under the "config-
read" permission. Therefore, Solr Clouds with Authorization enabled
will only be vulnerable through logged-in users that have the "config-
read" permission. Users are recommended to upgrade to version 9.3.0 or
8.11.3, which fixes the issue. A single option now controls hiding
Java system property for all endpoints, "-Dsolr.hiddenSysProps". By
default all known sensitive properties are hidden (including
"-Dbasicauth"), as well as any property with a name containing
"secret" or "password". Users who cannot upgrade can also use the
following Java system property to fix the issue:
'-Dsolr.redaction.system.pattern=.*(password|secret|basicauth).*'

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/09/3

Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource, Improper
Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources vulnerability in Apache
Solr. This issue affects Apache Solr: from 8.10.0 through 8.11.2, from
9.0.0 before 9.3.0. The Schema Designer was introduced to allow users
to more easily configure and test new Schemas and configSets. However,
when the feature was created, the "trust" (authentication) of these
configSets was not considered. External library loading is only
available to configSets that are "trusted" (created by authenticated
users), thus non-authenticated users are unable to perform Remote Code
Execution. Since the Schema Designer loaded configSets without taking
their "trust" into account, configSets that were created by
unauthenticated users were allowed to load external libraries when
used in the Schema Designer. Users are recommended to upgrade to
version 9.3.0, which fixes the issue.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/09/2

Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue affects Apache Solr: from
6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before 9.4.1. Solr Streaming
Expressions allows users to extract data from other Solr Clouds, using
a "zkHost" parameter. When original SolrCloud is setup to use
ZooKeeper credentials and ACLs, they will be sent to whatever "zkHost"
the user provides. An attacker could setup a server to mock ZooKeeper,
that accepts ZooKeeper requests with credentials and ACLs and extracts
the sensitive information, then send a streaming expression using the
mock server's address in "zkHost". Streaming Expressions are exposed
via the "/streaming" handler, with "read" permissions. Users are
recommended to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the
issue. From these versions on, only zkHost values that have the same
server address (regardless of chroot), will use the given ZooKeeper
credentials and ACLs when connecting.

Improper Control of Dynamically-Managed Code Resources, Unrestricted
Upload of File with Dangerous Type, Inclusion of Functionality from
Untrusted Control Sphere vulnerability in Apache Solr.This issue
affects Apache Solr: from 6.0.0 through 8.11.2, from 9.0.0 before
9.4.1. In the affected versions, Solr ConfigSets accepted Java jar and
class files to be uploaded through the ConfigSets API. When backing up
Solr Collections, these configSet files would be saved to disk when
using the LocalFileSystemRepository (the default for backups). If the
backup was saved to a directory that Solr uses in its
ClassPath/ClassLoaders, then the jar and class files would be
available to use with any ConfigSet, trusted or untrusted. When Solr
is run in a secure way (Authorization enabled), as is strongly
suggested, this vulnerability is limited to extending the Backup
permissions with the ability to add libraries. Users are recommended
to upgrade to version 8.11.3 or 9.4.1, which fix the issue. In these
versions, the following protections have been added: * Users are no
longer able to upload files to a configSet that could be executed via
a Java ClassLoader. * The Backup API restricts saving backups to
directories that are used in the ClassLoader.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20240216 Re: Unbound: disclosure of CVE-2023-50387 and CVE-2023-50868 DNSSEC validation vulnerabilities
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2024/02/16/3

Certain DNSSEC aspects of the DNS protocol (in RFC 4033, 4034, 4035,
6840, and related RFCs) allow remote attackers to cause a denial of
service (CPU consumption) via one or more DNSSEC responses, aka the
"KeyTrap" issue. One of the concerns is that, when there is a zone
with many DNSKEY and RRSIG records, the protocol specification implies
that an algorithm must evaluate all combinations of DNSKEY and RRSIG
records.

yii2-authclient is an extension that adds OpenID, OAuth, OAuth2 and
OpenId Connect consumers for the Yii framework 2.0. In yii2-authclient
prior to version 2.2.15, the Oauth1/2 `state` and OpenID Connect
`nonce` is vulnerable for a `timing attack` since it is compared via
regular string comparison (instead of
`Yii::$app->getSecurity()->compareString()`). Version 2.2.15 contains
a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.

The Sitekit plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
Scripting via 'sitekit_iframe' shortcode in versions up to, and
including, 1.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
contributor-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in
pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

Hono is a web framework written in TypeScript. Prior to version
3.11.7, clients may override named path parameter values from previous
requests if the application is using TrieRouter. So, there is a risk
that a privileged user may use unintended parameters when deleting
REST API resources. TrieRouter is used either explicitly or when the
application matches a pattern that is not supported by the default
RegExpRouter. Version 3.11.7 includes the change to fix this issue. As
a workaround, avoid using TrieRouter directly.

vmm-sys-util is a collection of modules that provides helpers and
utilities used by multiple rust-vmm components. Starting in version
0.5.0 and prior to version 0.12.0, an issue in the
`FamStructWrapper::deserialize` implementation provided by the crate
for `vmm_sys_util::fam::FamStructWrapper` can lead to out of bounds
memory accesses. The deserialization does not check that the length
stored in the header matches the flexible array length. Mismatch in
the lengths might allow out of bounds memory access through Rust-safe
methods. The issue was corrected in version 0.12.0 by inserting a
check that verifies the lengths of compared flexible arrays are equal
for any deserialized header and aborting deserialization otherwise.
Moreover, the API was changed so that header length can only be
modified through Rust-unsafe code. This ensures that users cannot
trigger out-of-bounds memory access from Rust-safe code.

Iris is a web collaborative platform aiming to help incident
responders sharing technical details during investigations. A stored
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in iris-
web, affecting multiple locations in versions prior to v2.3.7. The
vulnerability may allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into
the application, which could then be executed when a user visits the
affected locations. This could lead to unauthorized access, data
theft, or other related malicious activities. An attacker need to be
authenticated on the application to exploit this vulnerability. The
issue is fixed in version v2.3.7 of iris-web. No known workarounds are
available.

Speckle Server provides server, frontend, 3D viewer, and other
JavaScript utilities for the Speckle 3D data platform. A vulnerability
in versions prior to 2.17.6 affects users who: authorized an
application which requested a 'token write' scope or, using
frontend-2, created a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `token write`
scope. When creating a new token an agent needs to authorise the
request with an existing token (the 'requesting token'). The
requesting token is required to have token write scope in order to
generate new tokens. However, Speckle server was not verifying that
other privileges granted to the new token were not in excess of the
privileges of the requesting token. A malicious actor could use a
token with only token write scope to subsequently generate further
tokens with additional privileges. These privileges would only grant
privileges up to the existing privileges of the user. This
vulnerability cannot be used to escalate a user's privileges or grant
privileges on behalf of other users. This has been patched as of
version 2.17.6. All operators of Speckle servers should upgrade their
server to version 2.17.6 or higher. Any users who authorized an
application with 'token write' scope, or created a token in frontend-2
with `token write` scope should review existing tokens and permanently
revoke any they do not recognize, revoke existing tokens and create
new tokens, and review usage of their account for suspicious activity.
No known workarounds for this issue exist.

yii2-authclient is an extension that adds OpenID, OAuth, OAuth2 and
OpenId Connect consumers for the Yii framework 2.0. In yii2-authclient
prior to version 2.2.15, the Oauth2 PKCE implementation is vulnerable
in 2 ways. First, the `authCodeVerifier` should be removed after usage
(similar to `authState`). Second, there is a risk for a `downgrade
attack` if PKCE is being relied on for CSRF protection. Version 2.2.15
contains a patch for the issue. No known workarounds are available.

Home Assistant is open source home automation software. Prior to
version 2023.12.3, the login page discloses all active user accounts
to any unauthenticated browsing request originating on the Local Area
Network. Version 2023.12.3 contains a patch for this issue. When
starting the Home Assistant 2023.12 release, the login page returns
all currently active user accounts to browsing requests from the Local
Area Network. Tests showed that this occurs when the request is not
authenticated and the request originated locally, meaning on the Home
Assistant host local subnet or any other private subnet. The rationale
behind this is to make the login more user-friendly and an experience
better aligned with other applications that have multiple user-
profiles. However, as a result, all accounts are displayed regardless
of them having logged in or not and for any device that navigates to
the server. This disclosure is mitigated by the fact that it only
occurs for requests originating from a LAN address. But note that this
applies to the local subnet where Home Assistant resides and to any
private subnet that can reach it.

defined manifests. Use of the feature should generally be limited to
highly-trusted users, since it allows the user to bypass any merge
protections in git. An improper validation bug allows users who have
`create` privileges but not `override` privileges to sync local
manifests on app creation. All other restrictions, including
AppProject restrictions are still enforced. The only restriction which
is not enforced is that the manifests come from some approved
git/Helm/OCI source. The bug was introduced in 1.2.0-rc1 when the
local manifest sync feature was added. The bug has been patched in
Argo CD versions 2.10.3, 2.9.8, and 2.8.12. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may mitigate the risk of branch
protection bypass by removing `applications, create` RBAC access. The
only way to eliminate the issue without removing RBAC access is to
upgrade to a patched version.

Grackle is a GraphQL server written in functional Scala, built on the
Typelevel stack. The GraphQL specification requires that GraphQL
fragments must not form cycles, either directly or indirectly. Prior
to Grackle version 0.18.0, that requirement wasn't checked, and
queries with cyclic fragments would have been accepted for type
checking and compilation. The attempted compilation of such fragments
would result in a JVM `StackOverflowError` being thrown. Some
knowledge of an applications GraphQL schema would be required to
construct such a query, however no knowledge of any application-
specific performance or other behavioural characteristics would be
needed. Grackle uses the cats-parse library for parsing GraphQL
queries. Prior to version 0.18.0, Grackle made use of the cats-parse
`recursive` operator. However, `recursive` is not currently stack
safe. `recursive` was used in three places in the parser: nested
selection sets, nested input values (lists and objects), and nested
list type declarations. Consequently, queries with deeply nested
selection sets, input values or list types could be constructed which
exploited this, causing a JVM `StackOverflowException` to be thrown
during parsing. Because this happens very early in query processing,
no specific knowledge of an applications GraphQL schema would be
required to construct such a query. The possibility of small queries
resulting in stack overflow is a potential denial of service
vulnerability. This potentially affects all applications using Grackle
which have untrusted users. Both stack overflow issues have been
resolved in the v0.18.0 release of Grackle. As a workaround, users
could interpose a sanitizing layer in between untrusted input and
Grackle query processing.

MindsDB is a SQL Server for artificial intelligence. Prior to version
23.11.4.1, the `put` method in
`mindsdb/mindsdb/api/http/namespaces/file.py` does not validate the
user-controlled name value, which is used in a temporary file name,
which is afterwards opened for writing on lines 122-125, which leads
to path injection. Later in the method, the temporary directory is
deleted on line 151, but since we can write outside of the directory
using the path injection vulnerability, the potentially dangerous file
is not deleted. Arbitrary file contents can be written due to
`f.write(chunk)` on line 125. Mindsdb does check later on line 149 in
the `save_file` method in `file-controller.py` which calls the
`_handle_source` method in `file_handler.py` if a file is of one of
the types `csv`, `json`, `parquet`, `xls`, or `xlsx`. However, since
the check happens after the file has already been written, the files
will still exist (and will not be removed due to the path injection
described earlier), just the `_handle_source` method will return an
error. The same user-controlled source source is used also in another
path injection sink on line 138. This leads to another path injection,
which allows an attacker to delete any `zip` or `tar.gz` files on the
server.

The Copy Anything to Clipboard plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
Stored Cross-Site Scripting via 'copy' shortcode in versions up to,
and including, 2.6.4 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a
user accesses an injected page.

The Closest Encloser Proof aspect of the DNS protocol (in RFC 5155
when RFC 9276 guidance is skipped) allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (CPU consumption for SHA-1 computations) via DNSSEC
responses in a random subdomain attack, aka the "NSEC3" issue. The RFC
5155 specification implies that an algorithm must perform thousands of
iterations of a hash function in certain situations.

Kyocera Device Manager before 3.1.1213.0 allows NTLM credential
exposure during UNC path authentication via a crafted change from a
local path to a UNC path. It allows administrators to configure the
backup location of the database used by the application. Attempting to
change this location to a UNC path via the GUI is rejected due to the
use of a \ (backslash) character, which is supposed to be disallowed
in a pathname. Intercepting and modifying this request via a proxy, or
sending the request directly to the application endpoint, allows UNC
paths to be set for the backup location. Once such a location is set,
Kyocera Device Manager attempts to confirm access and will try to
authenticate to the UNC path; depending on the configuration of the
environment, this may authenticate to the UNC with Windows NTLM
hashes. This could allow NTLM credential relaying or cracking attacks.

Englesystem is a shift planning system for chaos events. Engelsystem
prior to v3.4.1 performed insufficient validation of user supplied
data for the DECT number, mobile number, and work-log comment fields.
The values of those fields would be displayed in corresponding log
overviews, allowing the injection and execution of Javascript code in
another user's context. This vulnerability enables an authenticated
user to inject Javascript into other user's sessions. The injected JS
will be executed during normal usage of the system when viewing, e.g.,
overview pages. This issue has been fixed in version 3.4.1.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
Next-Generation IoT devices. An out-of-bounds read can be caused by an
incoming DIO message when using the RPL-Lite implementation in the
Contiki-NG operating system. More specifically, the prefix information
of the DIO message contains a field that specifies the length of an
IPv6 address prefix. The value of this field is not validated, which
means that an attacker can set a value that is longer than the maximum
prefix length. Subsequently, a memcmp function call that compares
different prefixes can be called with a length argument that surpasses
the boundary of the array allocated for the prefix, causing an out-of-
bounds read. The problem has been patched in the "develop" branch of
Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in the next release. Users
are advised to update as soon as they are able to or to manually apply
the changes in Contiki-NG pull request #2721.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
Next-Generation IoT devices. An attacker can trigger out-of-bounds
reads in the RPL-Lite implementation of the RPL protocol in the
Contiki-NG operating system. This vulnerability is caused by
insufficient control of the lengths for DIO and DAO messages, in
particular when they contain RPL sub-option headers. The problem has
been patched in Contiki-NG 4.9. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
unable to upgrade should manually apply the code changes in PR #2484.

The JSON datasource plugin (
https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/
https://grafana.com/grafana/plugins/marcusolsson-json-datasource/ ) is
a Grafana Labs maintained plugin for Grafana that allows for
retrieving and processing JSON data from a remote endpoint (including
a specific sub-path) configured by an administrator. Due to inadequate
sanitization of the dashboard-supplied path parameter, it was possible
to include path traversal characters (../) in the path parameter and
send requests to paths on the configured endpoint outside the
configured sub-path. This means that if the datasource was configured
by an administrator to point at some sub-path of a domain (e.g.
https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/
https://example.com/api/some_safe_api/ ), it was possible for an
editor to create a dashboard referencing the datasource which issues
queries containing path traversal characters, which would in turn
cause the datasource to instead query arbitrary subpaths on the
configured domain (e.g. https://example.com/api/admin_api/)
https://example.com/api/admin_api/) . In the rare case that this
plugin is configured by an administrator to point back at the Grafana
instance itself, this vulnerability becomes considerably more severe,
as an administrator browsing a maliciously configured panel could be
compelled to make requests to Grafana administrative API endpoints
with their credentials, resulting in the potential for privilege
escalation, hence the high score for this vulnerability.

The Delete Me plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
Scripting via 'plugin_delete_me' shortcode in versions up to, and
including, 3.0 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a
user accesses an injected page. The shortcode is not displayed to
administrators, so it cannot be used against administrator users.

In ssh-agent in OpenSSH before 9.6, certain destination constraints
can be incompletely applied. When destination constraints are
specified during addition of PKCS#11-hosted private keys, these
constraints are only applied to the first key, even if a PKCS#11 token
returns multiple keys.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/26/4

In ssh in OpenSSH before 9.6, OS command injection might occur if a
user name or host name has shell metacharacters, and this name is
referenced by an expansion token in certain situations. For example,
an untrusted Git repository can have a submodule with shell
metacharacters in a user name or host name.

Sandbox Accounts for Events provides multiple, temporary AWS accounts
to a number of authenticated users simultaneously via a browser-based
GUI. Authenticated users could potentially read data from the events
table by sending request payloads to the events API, collecting
information on planned events, timeframes, budgets and owner email
addresses. This data access may allow users to get insights into
upcoming events and join events which they have not been invited to.
This issue has been patched in version 1.10.0.

Hertzbeat is an open source, real-time monitoring system. Hertzbeat
uses aviatorscript to evaluate alert expressions. The alert
expressions are supposed to be some simple expressions. However, due
to improper sanitization for alert expressions in version prior to
1.4.1, a malicious user can use a crafted alert expression to execute
any command on hertzbeat server. A malicious user who has access to
alert define function can execute any command in hertzbeat instance.
This issue is fixed in version 1.4.1.

Hertzbeat is a real-time monitoring system. In `CalculateAlarm.java`,
`AviatorEvaluator` is used to directly execute the expression
function, and no security policy is configured, resulting in
AviatorScript (which can execute any static method by default) script
injection. Version 1.4.1 fixes this vulnerability.

Navidrome is an open source web-based music collection server and
streamer. A security vulnerability has been identified in navidrome's
subsonic endpoint, allowing for authentication bypass. This exploit
enables unauthorized access to any known account by utilizing a JSON
Web Token (JWT) signed with the key "not so secret". The vulnerability
can only be exploited on instances that have never been restarted.
Navidrome supports an extension to the subsonic authentication scheme,
where a JWT can be provided using a `jwt` query parameter instead of
the traditional password or token and salt (corresponding to resp. the
`p` or `t` and `s` query parameters). This authentication bypass
vulnerability potentially affects all instances that don't protect the
subsonic endpoint `/rest/`, which is expected to be most instances in
a standard deployment, and most instances in the reverse proxy setup
too (as the documentation mentions to leave that endpoint
unprotected). This issue has been patched in version 0.50.2.

FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital
transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software
implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version
1.10.11, when handling DTLS-SRTP for media setup, FreeSWITCH is
susceptible to Denial of Service due to a race condition in the hello
handshake phase of the DTLS protocol. This attack can be done
continuously, thus denying new DTLS-SRTP encrypted calls during the
attack. If an attacker manages to send a ClientHello DTLS message with
an invalid CipherSuite (such as `TLS_NULL_WITH_NULL_NULL`) to the port
on the FreeSWITCH server that is expecting packets from the caller, a
DTLS error is generated. This results in the media session being torn
down, which is followed by teardown at signaling (SIP) level too.
Abuse of this vulnerability may lead to a massive Denial of Service on
vulnerable FreeSWITCH servers for calls that rely on DTLS-SRTP. To
address this vulnerability, upgrade FreeSWITCH to 1.10.11 which
includes the security fix. The solution implemented is to drop all
packets from addresses that have not been validated by an ICE check.

GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that
allows users to share and edit geospatial data. An arbitrary file
upload vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.4 and 2.24.1
that enables an authenticated administrator with permissions to modify
coverage stores through the REST Coverage Store API to upload
arbitrary file contents to arbitrary file locations which can lead to
remote code execution. Coverage stores that are configured using
relative paths use a GeoServer Resource implementation that has
validation to prevent path traversal but coverage stores that are
configured using absolute paths use a different Resource
implementation that does not prevent path traversal. This
vulnerability can lead to executing arbitrary code. An administrator
with limited privileges could also potentially exploit this to
overwrite GeoServer security files and obtain full administrator
privileges. Versions 2.23.4 and 2.24.1 contain a fix for this issue.

GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that
allows users to share and edit geospatial data. A stored cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in versions prior to 2.23.3 and
2.24.0 that enables an authenticated administrator with workspace-
level privileges to store a JavaScript payload in uploaded
style/legend resources that will execute in the context of another
administrator's browser when viewed in the REST Resources API. Access
to the REST Resources API is limited to full administrators by default
and granting non-administrators access to this endpoint should be
carefully considered as it may allow access to files containing
sensitive information. Versions 2.23.3 and 2.24.0 contain a patch for
this issue.

Decidim is a participatory democracy framework. Starting in version
0.27.0 and prior to versions 0.27.5 and 0.28.0, the dynamic file
upload feature is subject to potential cross-site scripting attacks in
case the attacker manages to modify the file names of the records
being uploaded to the server. This appears in sections where the user
controls the file upload dialogs themselves and has the technical
knowledge to change the file names through the dynamic upload
endpoint. Therefore I believe it would require the attacker to control
the whole session of the particular user but in any case, this needs
to be fixed. Successful exploit of this vulnerability would require
the user to have successfully uploaded a file blob to the server with
a malicious file name and then have the possibility to direct the
other user to the edit page of the record where the attachment is
attached. The users are able to craft the direct upload requests
themselves controlling the file name that gets stored to the database.
The attacker is able to change the filename e.g. to `<svg
onload=alert('XSS')>` if they know how to craft these requests
themselves. And then enter the returned blob ID to the form inputs
manually by modifying the edit page source. Versions 0.27.5 and 0.28.0
contain a patch for this issue. As a workaround, disable dynamic
uploads for the instance, e.g. from proposals.

Gradio is an open-source Python package that allows you to quickly
build a demo or web application for your machine learning model, API,
or any arbitary Python function. Versions of `gradio` prior to 4.11.0
contained a vulnerability in the `/file` route which made them
susceptible to file traversal attacks in which an attacker could
access arbitrary files on a machine running a Gradio app with a public
URL (e.g. if the demo was created with `share=True`, or on Hugging
Face Spaces) if they knew the path of files to look for. This issue
has been patched in version 4.11.0.

Symbolicator is a service used in Sentry. Starting in Symbolicator
version 0.3.3 and prior to version 21.12.1, an attacker could make
Symbolicator send GET HTTP requests to arbitrary URLs with internal IP
addresses by using an invalid protocol. The responses of those
requests could be exposed via Symbolicator's API. In affected Sentry
instances, the data could be exposed through the Sentry API and user
interface if the attacker has a registered account. The issue has been
fixed in Symbolicator release 23.12.1, Sentry self-hosted release
23.12.1, and has already been mitigated on sentry.io on December 18,
2023. If updating is not possible, some other mitigations are
available. One may disable JS processing by toggling the option `Allow
JavaScript Source Fetching` in `Organization Settings > Security &
Privacy` and/or disable all untrusted public repositories under
`Project Settings > Debug Files`. Alternatively, if JavaScript and
native symbolication are not required, disable Symbolicator completely
in `config.yml`.

Apache James prior to version 3.7.5 and 3.8.0 exposes a JMX endpoint
on localhost subject to pre-authentication deserialisation of
untrusted data. Given a deserialisation gadjet, this could be
leveraged as part of an exploit chain that could result in privilege
escalation. Note that by default JMX endpoint is only bound locally.
We recommend users to: - Upgrade to a non-vulnerable Apache James
version - Run Apache James isolated from other processes (docker -
dedicated virtual machine) - If possible turn off JMX
