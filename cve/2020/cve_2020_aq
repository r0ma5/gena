it, and discover a hardcoded IV used to encrypt the username and
userid in the comment POST request. Additionally, the attacker can
decrypt the encrypted encryption key (sent as a parameter in the
comment form request) by setting this encrypted value as the username,
which will appear on the comment page in its decrypted form. Using
these two values (combined with the encryption functionality
discovered in the decompiled installer), the attacker can encrypt
another user's ID and username. These values can be used as part of
the comment posting request in order to spoof the user.

Tencent GameLoop before 4.1.21.90 downloaded updates over an insecure
HTTP connection. A malicious attacker in an MITM position could spoof
the contents of an XML document describing an update package,
replacing a download URL with one pointing to an arbitrary Windows
executable. Because the only integrity check would be a comparison of
the downloaded file's MD5 checksum to the one contained within the XML
document, the downloaded executable would then be executed on the
victim's machine.

libspf2 before 1.2.11 has a four-byte heap-based buffer overflow that
might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code (via an
unauthenticated e-mail message from anywhere on the Internet) with a
crafted SPF DNS record, because of incorrect sprintf usage in
SPF_record_expand_data in spf_expand.c. The vulnerable code may be
part of the supply chain of a site's e-mail infrastructure (e.g., with
additional configuration, Exim can use libspf2; the Postfix web site
links to unofficial patches for use of libspf2 with Postfix; older
versions of spfquery relied on libspf2) but most often is not.

The lack of validation of a key-value field in the Splunk-to-Splunk
protocol results in a denial-of-service in Splunk Enterprise instances
configured to index Universal Forwarder traffic. The vulnerability
impacts Splunk Enterprise versions before 7.3.9, 8.0 versions before
8.0.9, and 8.1 versions before 8.1.3. It does not impact Universal
Forwarders. When Splunk forwarding is secured using TLS or a Token,
the attack requires compromising the certificate or token, or both.
Implementation of either or both reduces the severity to Medium.

Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An infinite loop
is triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted
image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to
cause a denial of service, if they can trick the victim into running
Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5.

Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A floating point
exception (FPE) due to an integer divide by zero was found in Exiv2
versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The FPE is triggered when Exiv2 is used
to print the metadata of a crafted image file. An attacker could
potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if
they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.
Note that this bug is only triggered when printing the interpreted
(translated) data, which is a less frequently used Exiv2 operation
that requires an extra command line option (`-p t` or `-P t`). The bug
is fixed in version v0.27.5.

An issue was discovered in Mailman Core before 3.3.5. An attacker with
access to the REST API could use timing attacks to determine the value
of the configured REST API password and then make arbitrary REST API
calls. The REST API is bound to localhost by default, limiting the
ability for attackers to exploit this, but can optionally be made to
listen on other interfaces.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20210323 [CVE-2021-3444] Linux kernel bpf verifier incorrect mod32 truncation
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/23/2

The bpf verifier in the Linux kernel did not properly handle mod32
destination register truncation when the source register was known to
be 0. A local attacker with the ability to load bpf programs could use
this gain out-of-bounds reads in kernel memory leading to information
disclosure (kernel memory), and possibly out-of-bounds writes that
could potentially lead to code execution. This issue was addressed in
the upstream kernel in commit 9b00f1b78809 ("bpf: Fix truncation
handling for mod32 dst reg wrt zero") and in Linux stable kernels
5.11.2, 5.10.19, and 5.4.101.

A flaw was found in libtpms in versions before 0.8.2. The commonly
used integration of libtpms with OpenSSL contained a vulnerability
related to the returned IV (initialization vector) when certain
symmetric ciphers were used. Instead of returning the last IV it
returned the initial IV to the caller, thus weakening the subsequent
encryption and decryption steps. The highest threat from this
vulnerability is to data confidentiality.

A flaw was found in several ansible modules, where parameters
containing credentials, such as secrets, were being logged in plain-
text on managed nodes, as well as being made visible on the controller
node when run in verbose mode. These parameters were not protected by
the no_log feature. An attacker can take advantage of this information
to steal those credentials, provided when they have access to the log
files containing them. The highest threat from this vulnerability is
to data confidentiality. This flaw affects Red Hat Ansible Automation
Platform in versions before 1.2.2 and Ansible Tower in versions before
3.8.2.

A flaw was found in dnsmasq in versions before 2.85. When configured
to use a specific server for a given network interface, dnsmasq uses a
fixed port while forwarding queries. An attacker on the network, able
to find the outgoing port used by dnsmasq, only needs to guess the
random transmission ID to forge a reply and get it accepted by
dnsmasq. This flaw makes a DNS Cache Poisoning attack much easier. The
highest threat from this vulnerability is to data integrity.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/28/4

An OpenSSL TLS server may crash if sent a maliciously crafted
renegotiation ClientHello message from a client. If a TLSv1.2
renegotiation ClientHello omits the signature_algorithms extension
(where it was present in the initial ClientHello), but includes a
signature_algorithms_cert extension then a NULL pointer dereference
will result, leading to a crash and a denial of service attack. A
server is only vulnerable if it has TLSv1.2 and renegotiation enabled
(which is the default configuration). OpenSSL TLS clients are not
impacted by this issue. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 versions are affected by
this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k.
OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k
(Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1j).

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/28/4

The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT flag enables additional security checks of
the certificates present in a certificate chain. It is not set by
default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to disallow
certificates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve
parameters was added as an additional strict check. An error in the
implementation of this check meant that the result of a previous check
to confirm that certificates in the chain are valid CA certificates
was overwritten. This effectively bypasses the check that non-CA
certificates must not be able to issue other certificates. If a
"purpose" has been configured then there is a subsequent opportunity
for checks that the certificate is a valid CA. All of the named
"purpose" values implemented in libcrypto perform this check.
Therefore, where a purpose is set the certificate chain will still be
rejected even when the strict flag has been used. A purpose is set by
default in libssl client and server certificate verification routines,
but it can be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be
affected, an application must explicitly set the
X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT verification flag and either not set a purpose
for the certificate verification or, in the case of TLS client or
server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL versions
1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions
should upgrade to OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by
this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected 1.1.1h-1.1.1j).

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the Windows Print
Spooler service improperly performs privileged file operations. An
attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run
arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights.</p> <p>UPDATE July 7, 2021: The security update for
Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2016 and Windows 10, Version 1607
have been released. Please see the Security Updates table for the
applicable update for your system. We recommend that you install these
updates immediately. If you are unable to install these updates, see
the FAQ and Workaround sections in this CVE for information on how to
help protect your system from this vulnerability.</p> <p>In addition
to installing the updates, in order to secure your system, you must
confirm that the following registry settings are set to 0 (zero) or
are not defined (<strong>Note</strong>: These registry keys do not
exist by default, and therefore are already at the secure setting.),
also that your Group Policy setting are correct (see FAQ):</p> <ul>
<li>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
NT\Printers\PointAndPrint</li> <li>NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall = 0
(DWORD) or not defined (default setting)</li> <li>UpdatePromptSettings
= 0 (DWORD) or not defined (default setting)</li> </ul>
<p><strong>Having NoWarningNoElevationOnInstall set to 1 makes your
system vulnerable by design.</strong></p> <p>UPDATE July 6, 2021:
Microsoft has completed the investigation and has released security
updates to address this vulnerability. Please see the Security Updates
table for the applicable update for your system. We recommend that you
install these updates immediately. If you are unable to install these
updates, see the FAQ and Workaround sections in this CVE for

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/07/06/2

XScreenSaver 5.45 can be bypassed if the machine has more than ten
disconnectable video outputs. A buffer overflow in
update_screen_layout() allows an attacker to bypass the standard
screen lock authentication mechanism by crashing XScreenSaver. The
attacker must physically disconnect many video outputs.

A vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) message
parser of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an
attacker to trigger a reload of an affected device, resulting in a
denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to
improper initialization of a buffer. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability via any of the following methods: An authenticated,
remote attacker could access the LLDP neighbor table via either the
CLI or SNMP while the device is in a specific state. An
unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could corrupt the LLDP neighbor
table by injecting specific LLDP frames into the network and then
waiting for an administrator of the device or a network management
system (NMS) managing the device to retrieve the LLDP neighbor table
of the device via either the CLI or SNMP. An authenticated, adjacent
attacker with SNMP read-only credentials or low privileges on the
device CLI could corrupt the LLDP neighbor table by injecting specific
LLDP frames into the network and then accessing the LLDP neighbor
table via either the CLI or SNMP. A successful exploit could allow the
attacker to cause the affected device to crash, resulting in a reload
of the device.

The eBPF RINGBUF bpf_ringbuf_reserve() function in the Linux kernel
did not check that the allocated size was smaller than the ringbuf
size, allowing an attacker to perform out-of-bounds writes within the
kernel and therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed
via commit 4b81ccebaeee ("bpf, ringbuf: Deny reserve of buffers larger
than ringbuf") (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in
v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was introduced via 457f44363a88

The eBPF ALU32 bounds tracking for bitwise ops (AND, OR and XOR) in
the Linux kernel did not properly update 32-bit bounds, which could be
turned into out of bounds reads and writes in the Linux kernel and
therefore, arbitrary code execution. This issue was fixed via commit
049c4e13714e ("bpf: Fix alu32 const subreg bound tracking on bitwise
operations") (v5.13-rc4) and backported to the stable kernels in
v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. The AND/OR issues were introduced by
commit 3f50f132d840 ("bpf: Verifier, do explicit ALU32 bounds
tracking") (5.7-rc1) and the XOR variant was introduced by
2921c90d4718 ("bpf:Fix a verifier failure with xor") ( 5.10-rc1).

There is a flaw in RPM's signature functionality. OpenPGP subkeys are
associated with a primary key via a "binding signature." RPM does not
check the binding signature of subkeys prior to importing them. If an
attacker is able to add or socially engineer another party to add a
malicious subkey to a legitimate public key, RPM could wrongly trust a
malicious signature. The greatest impact of this flaw is to data
integrity. To exploit this flaw, an attacker must either compromise an
RPM repository or convince an administrator to install an untrusted
RPM or public key. It is strongly recommended to only use RPMs and
public keys from trusted sources.

A flaw was found in the Red Hat Ceph Storage RadosGW (Ceph Object
Gateway) in versions before 14.2.21. The vulnerability is related to
the injection of HTTP headers via a CORS ExposeHeader tag. The newline
character in the ExposeHeader tag in the CORS configuration file
generates a header injection in the response when the CORS request is
made. In addition, the prior bug fix for CVE-2020-10753 did not
account for the use of \r as a header separator, thus a new flaw has
been created.

A flaw was found in the USB redirector device (usb-redir) of QEMU.
Small USB packets are combined into a single, large transfer request,
to reduce the overhead and improve performance. The combined size of
the bulk transfer is used to dynamically allocate a variable length
array (VLA) on the stack without proper validation. Since the total
size is not bounded, a malicious guest could use this flaw to
influence the array length and cause the QEMU process to perform an
excessive allocation on the stack, resulting in a denial of service.

Realtek Jungle SDK version v2.x up to v3.4.14B provides an HTTP web
server exposing a management interface that can be used to configure
the access point. Two versions of this management interface exists:
one based on Go-Ahead named webs and another based on Boa named boa.
Both of them are affected by these vulnerabilities. Specifically,
these binaries are vulnerable to the following issues: - stack buffer
overflow in formRebootCheck due to unsafe copy of submit-url parameter
- stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of submit-url
parameter - stack buffer overflow in formWlanMultipleAP due to unsafe
copy of submit-url parameter - stack buffer overflow in
formWlSiteSurvey due to unsafe copy of ifname parameter - stack buffer
overflow in formStaticDHCP due to unsafe copy of hostname parameter -
stack buffer overflow in formWsc due to unsafe copy of 'peerPin'
parameter - arbitrary command execution in formSysCmd via the sysCmd
parameter - arbitrary command injection in formWsc via the 'peerPin'
parameter Exploitability of identified issues will differ based on
what the end vendor/manufacturer did with the Realtek SDK webserver.
Some vendors use it as-is, others add their own authentication
implementation, some kept all the features from the server, some
remove some of them, some inserted their own set of features. However,
given that Realtek SDK implementation is full of insecure calls and
that developers tends to re-use those examples in their custom code,
any binary based on Realtek SDK webserver will probably contains its
own set of issues on top of the Realtek ones (if kept). Successful
exploitation of these issues allows remote attackers to gain arbitrary
code execution on the device.

A path traversal vulnerability in the static router for Drogon from
1.0.0-beta14 to 1.6.0 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker
to arbitrarily read files. The vulnerability is due to lack of proper
input validation for requested path. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP request with specific path to
read. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to read files
that should be restricted.

Prior to ffmpeg version 4.3, the tty demuxer did not have a
'read_probe' function assigned to it. By crafting a legitimate
"ffconcat" file that references an image, followed by a file the
triggers the tty demuxer, the contents of the second file will be
copied into the output file verbatim (as long as the `-vcodec copy`
option is passed to ffmpeg).

A symbolic link issue was found in rpm. It occurs when rpm sets the
desired permissions and credentials after installing a file. A local
unprivileged user could use this flaw to exchange the original file
with a symbolic link to a security-critical file and escalate their
privileges on the system. The highest threat from this vulnerability
is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system
availability.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2017-7500 and CVE-2017-7501 was
incomplete: the check was only implemented for the parent directory of
the file to be created. A local unprivileged user who owns another
ancestor directory could potentially use this flaw to gain root
privileges. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

An out-of-bounds array read in the apr_time_exp*() functions was fixed
in the Apache Portable Runtime 1.6.3 release (CVE-2017-12613). The fix
for this issue was not carried forward to the APR 1.7.x branch, and
hence version 1.7.0 regressed compared to 1.6.3 and is vulnerable to
