<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that
Microsoft browsers access objects in memory. The vulnerability could
corrupt memory in a way that could allow an attacker to execute
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An attacker who
successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user
rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on with
administrative user rights, the attacker could take control of an
affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user
rights.</p> <p>An attacker could host a specially crafted website that
is designed to exploit the vulnerability through Microsoft browsers,
and then convince a user to view the website. The attacker could also
take advantage of compromised websites, or websites that accept or
host user-provided content or advertisements, by adding specially
crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases,
however, an attacker would have no way to force users to view the
attacker-controlled content. Instead, an attacker would have to
convince users to take action, typically via an enticement in email or
instant message, or by getting them to open an email attachment.</p>

Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the
system could be less impacted than users who operate with
administrative user rights.</p> <p>Exploitation of the vulnerability
requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected
version of the Windows Camera Codec Pack. In an email attack scenario,
an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially
crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In
a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or
leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided
content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the
vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit
the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to
click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant
message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted
file.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by
correcting how the Windows Camera Codec Pack handles objects in
memory.</p>

An issue has been found in PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.0 up to and including
4.3.0. It allows an attacker (with enough privileges to change the
system's hostname) to cause disclosure of uninitialized memory content
via a stack-based out-of-bounds read. It only occurs on systems where
gethostname() does not have '\0' termination of the returned string if
the hostname is larger than the supplied buffer. (Linux systems are
not affected because the buffer is always large enough. OpenBSD
systems are not affected because the returned hostname always has '\0'
termination.) Under some conditions, this issue can lead to the
writing of one '\0' byte out-of-bounds on the stack, causing a denial
of service or possibly arbitrary code execution.

Name: CVE-2020-10100
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://zammad.com/news/security-advisory-zaa-2020-05

An issue was discovered in Zammad 3.0 through 3.2. It allows for users
to view ticket customer details associated with specific customers.
However, the application does not properly implement access controls
related to this functionality. As such, users of one company are able
to access ticket data from other companies. Due to the multi-tenant
nature of this application, users who can access ticket details from
one organization to the next allows for users to exfiltrate
potentially sensitive data of other companies.

An issue was discovered in Zammad 3.0 through 3.2. The Forgot Password
functionality is implemented in a way that would enable an anonymous
user to guess valid user emails. In the current implementation, the
application responds differently depending on whether the input
supplied was recognized as associated with a valid user. This behavior
could be used as part of a two-stage automated attack. During the
first stage, an attacker would iterate through a list of account names
to determine which correspond to valid accounts. During the second
stage, the attacker would use a list of common passwords to attempt to
brute force credentials for accounts that were recognized by the
system in the first stage.

Pairing in Bluetooth Core v5.2 and earlier may permit an
unauthenticated attacker to acquire credentials with two pairing
devices via adjacent access when the unauthenticated user initiates
different pairing methods in each peer device and an end-user
erroneously completes both pairing procedures with the MITM using the
confirmation number of one peer as the passkey of the other. An
adjacent, unauthenticated attacker could be able to initiate any
Bluetooth operation on either attacked device exposed by the enabled
Bluetooth profiles. This exposure may be limited when the user must
authorize certain access explicitly, but so long as a user assumes
that it is the intended remote device requesting permissions, device-
local protections may be weakened.

The popup-builder plugin before 3.64.1 for WordPress allows
information disclosure and settings modification, leading to in-scope
privilege escalation via admin-post actions to
com/classes/Actions.php. By sending a POST request to wp-admin/admin-
post.php, an authenticated attacker with minimal (subscriber-level)
permissions can modify the plugin's settings to allow arbitrary roles
(including subscribers) access to plugin functionality by setting the
action parameter to sgpbSaveSettings, export a list of current
newsletter subscribers by setting the action parameter to csv_file, or
obtain system configuration information including webserver
configuration and a list of installed plugins by setting the action
parameter to sgpb_system_info.

An XSS vulnerability in the popup-builder plugin before 3.64.1 for
WordPress allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary JavaScript into
existing popups via an unsecured ajax action in com/classes/Ajax.php.
It is possible for an unauthenticated attacker to insert malicious
JavaScript in several of the popup's fields by sending a request to
wp-admin/admin-ajax.php with the POST action parameter of
sgpb_autosave and including additional data in an allPopupData
parameter, including the popup's ID (which is visible in the source of
the page in which the popup is inserted) and arbitrary JavaScript
which will then be executed in the browsers of visitors to that page.
Because the plugin functionality automatically adds script tags to
data entered into these fields, this injection will typically bypass
most WAF applications.

Modern DRAM chips (DDR4 and LPDDR4 after 2015) are affected by a
vulnerability in deployment of internal mitigations against RowHammer
attacks known as Target Row Refresh (TRR), aka the TRRespass issue. To
exploit this vulnerability, the attacker needs to create certain
access patterns to trigger bit flips on affected memory modules, aka a
Many-sided RowHammer attack. This means that, even when chips
advertised as RowHammer-free are used, attackers may still be able to
conduct privilege-escalation attacks against the kernel, conduct
privilege-escalation attacks against the Sudo binary, and achieve
cross-tenant virtual-machine access by corrupting RSA keys. The issue
affects chips produced by SK Hynix, Micron, and Samsung. NOTE:
tracking DRAM supply-chain issues is not straightforward because a
single product model from a single vendor may use DRAM chips from
different manufacturers.

The password for the safety PLC is the default and thus easy to find
(in manuals, etc.). This allows a manipulated program to be uploaded
to the safety PLC, effectively disabling the emergency stop in case an
object is too close to the robot. Navigation and any other components
dependent on the laser scanner are not affected (thus it is hard to
detect before something happens) though the laser scanner
configuration can also be affected altering further the safety of the
device.

This vulnerability applies to the Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink)
protocol and allows a remote attacker to gain access to sensitive
information provided it has access to the communication medium.
MAVLink is a header-based protocol that does not perform encryption to
improve transfer (and reception speed) and efficiency by design. The
increasing popularity of the protocol (used accross different
autopilots) has led to its use in wired and wireless mediums through
insecure communication channels exposing sensitive information to a
remote attacker with ability to intercept network traffic.

The Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol presents no
authentication mechanism on its version 1.0 (nor authorization) whichs
leads to a variety of attacks including identity spoofing,
unauthorized access, PITM attacks and more. According to literature,
version 2.0 optionally allows for package signing which mitigates this
flaw. Another source mentions that MAVLink 2.0 only provides a simple
authentication system based on HMAC. This implies that the flying
system overall should add the same symmetric key into all devices of
network. If not the case, this may cause a security issue, that if one
of the devices and its symmetric key are compromised, the whole
authentication system is not reliable.

The Micro Air Vehicle Link (MAVLink) protocol presents authentication
mechanisms on its version 2.0 however according to its documentation,
in order to maintain backwards compatibility, GCS and autopilot
negotiate the version via the AUTOPILOT_VERSION message. Since this
negotiation depends on the answer, an attacker may craft packages in a
way that hints the autopilot to adopt version 1.0 of MAVLink for the
communication. Given the lack of authentication capabilities in such
version of MAVLink (refer to CVE-2020-10282), attackers may use this
method to bypass authentication capabilities and interact with the
autopilot directly.

Visual Components (owned by KUKA) is a robotic simulator that allows
simulating factories and robots in order toimprove planning and
decision-making processes. Visual Components software requires a
special license which can beobtained from a network license server.
The network license server binds to all interfaces (0.0.0.0) and
listensfor packets over UDP port 5093. No authentication/authorization
is required in order to communicate with theserver. The protocol being
used is a property protocol by RMS Sentinel which provides the
licensing infrastructurefor the network license server. RMS Sentinel
license manager service exposes UDP port 5093 which provides
sensitivesystem information that could be leveraged for further
exploitation without any kind of authentication. Thisinformation
includes detailed hardware and OS characteristics.After a decryption
process, a textual protocol is found which contains a simple header
with the requested command,application-identifier, and some arguments.
The protocol leaks information regarding the receiving
serverinformation, license information and managing licenses, among
others.Through this flaw, attackers can retreive information about a
KUKA simulation system, particularly, the version ofthe licensing
server, which is connected to the simulator, and which will allow them
to launch local simulationswith similar characteristics, further
understanding the dynamics of motion virtualization and opening doors
toother attacks (see RVDP#711 and RVDP#712 for subsequent
vulnerabilities that compromise integrity andavailability).Beyond
compromising simulations, Visual Components provides capabilities to
interface with industrial machinery.Particularly, their PLC
Connectivity feature 'makes it easy' to connect simulations with
control systems usingeither the industry standard OPC UA or other
supported vendor specific interfaces. This fills the gap of
jumpingfrom simulation to real and enables attackers to pivot from the
Visual Components simulator to robots or otherIndustrial Control
System (ICS) devices, such as PLCs.

The protocol is vulnerable to DoS through an arbitrary
pointerderreference. This flaw allows an attacker to to pass a
specially crafted package that, when processed by theservice, causes
an arbitrary pointer from the stack to be dereferenced, causing an
uncaught exception thatterminates the service. This can be further
contructed in combination with RVDP#710 which exploits an
informationdisclosure leak, or with RVDP#711 for an stack-overflow and
potential code execution.Beyond denying simulations, Visual Components
provides capabilities to interface with industrial machinery
andautomate certain processes (e.g. testing, benchmarking, etc.) which
depending on the DevOps setup might beintegrated into the industrial
flow. Accordingly, a DoS in the simulation might have higher
repercusions, dependingon the Industrial Control System (ICS) ICS
infrastructure.

A remote code execution vulnerability was identified in GitHub
Enterprise Server that could be exploited when building a GitHub Pages
site. User-controlled configuration of the underlying parsers used by
GitHub Pages were not sufficiently restricted and made it possible to
execute commands on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance. To exploit
this vulnerability, an attacker would need permission to create and
build a GitHub Pages site on the GitHub Enterprise Server instance.
This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub Enterprise Server
prior to 2.22.7 and was fixed in 2.22.7, 2.21.15, and 2.20.24. The
underlying issues contributing to this vulnerability were identified
through the GitHub Security Bug Bounty program.

There is a use-after-free in kernel versions before 5.5 due to a race
condition between the release of ptp_clock and cdev while resource
deallocation. When a (high privileged) process allocates a ptp device
file (like /dev/ptpX) and voluntarily goes to sleep. During this time

A flaw was found in Ansible Tower when running Openshift. Tower runs a
memcached, which is accessed via TCP. An attacker can take advantage
of writing a playbook polluting this cache, causing a denial of
service attack. This attack would not completely stop the service, but
in the worst-case scenario, it can reduce the Tower performance, for
which memcached is designed. Theoretically, more sophisticated attacks
can be performed by manipulating and crafting the cache, as Tower
relies on memcached as a place to pull out setting values.
Confidential and sensitive data stored in memcached should not be

A security flaw was found in Ansible Tower when requesting an OAuth2
token with an OAuth2 application. Ansible Tower uses the token to
provide authentication. This flaw allows an attacker to obtain a
refresh token that does not expire. The original token granted to the
user still has access to Ansible Tower, which allows any user that can
gain access to the token to be fully authenticated to Ansible Tower.
This flaw affects Ansible Tower versions before 3.6.4 and Ansible
Tower versions before 3.5.6.

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel's
SELinux subsystem in versions before 5.7. This flaw occurs while
importing the Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO) protocol's
category bitmap into the SELinux extensible bitmap via the'
ebitmap_netlbl_import' routine. While processing the CIPSO restricted
bitmap tag in the 'cipso_v4_parsetag_rbm' routine, it sets the
security attribute to indicate that the category bitmap is present,
even if it has not been allocated. This issue leads to a NULL pointer
dereference issue while importing the same category bitmap into
SELinux. This flaw allows a remote network user to crash the system
kernel, resulting in a denial of service.

A flaw was found in grub2, prior to version 2.06. An attacker may use
the GRUB 2 flaw to hijack and tamper the GRUB verification process.
This flaw also allows the bypass of Secure Boot protections. In order
to load an untrusted or modified kernel, an attacker would first need
to establish access to the system such as gaining physical access,
obtain the ability to alter a pxe-boot network, or have remote access
to a networked system with root access. With this access, an attacker
could then craft a string to cause a buffer overflow by injecting a
malicious payload that leads to arbitrary code execution within GRUB.
The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality
and integrity as well as system availability.

A NULL pointer dereference, or possible use-after-free flaw was found
in Samba AD LDAP server in versions before 4.10.17, before 4.11.11 and
before 4.12.4. Although some versions of Samba shipped with Red Hat
Enterprise Linux do not support Samba in AD mode, the affected code is
shipped with the libldb package. This flaw allows an authenticated
user to possibly trigger a use-after-free or NULL pointer dereference.
The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.

cinder with the Dell EMC ScaleIO or VxFlex OS backend storage driver,
credentials for the entire backend are exposed in the
``connection_info`` element in all Block Storage v3 Attachments API
calls containing that element. This flaw enables an end-user to create
a volume, make an API call to show the attachment detail information,
and retrieve a username and password that may be used to connect to
another user's volume. Additionally, these credentials are valid for
the ScaleIO or VxFlex OS Management API, should an attacker discover

A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel before 5.8-rc6 in the ZRAM kernel
module, where a user with a local account and the ability to read the
/sys/class/zram-control/hot_add file can create ZRAM device nodes in

An issue was discovered in Arm Mbed TLS before 2.16.6 and 2.7.x before
2.7.15. An attacker that can get precise enough side-channel
measurements can recover the long-term ECDSA private key by (1)
reconstructing the projective coordinate of the result of scalar
multiplication by exploiting side channels in the conversion to affine
coordinates; (2) using an attack described by Naccache, Smart, and
Stern in 2003 to recover a few bits of the ephemeral scalar from those
projective coordinates via several measurements; and (3) using a
lattice attack to get from there to the long-term ECDSA private key
used for the signatures. Typically an attacker would have sufficient
access when attacking an SGX enclave and controlling the untrusted OS.

An issue was discovered in Ruby 2.5.x through 2.5.7, 2.6.x through
2.6.5, and 2.7.0. If a victim calls
BasicSocket#read_nonblock(requested_size, buffer, exception: false),
the method resizes the buffer to fit the requested size, but no data
is copied. Thus, the buffer string provides the previous value of the
heap. This may expose possibly sensitive data from the interpreter.

PowerDNS Recursor from 4.1.0 up to and including 4.3.0 does not
sufficiently defend against amplification attacks. An issue in the DNS
protocol has been found that allow malicious parties to use recursive
DNS services to attack third party authoritative name servers. The
attack uses a crafted reply by an authoritative name server to amplify
the resulting traffic between the recursive and other authoritative
name servers. Both types of service can suffer degraded performance as
an effect. This is triggered by random subdomains in the NSDNAME in NS
records. PowerDNS Recursor 4.1.16, 4.2.2 and 4.3.1 contain a
mitigation to limit the impact of this DNS protocol issue.

In Wagtail before versions 2.8.1 and 2.7.2, a cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerability exists on the page revision comparison view within
the Wagtail admin interface. A user with a limited-permission editor
account for the Wagtail admin could potentially craft a page revision
history that, when viewed by a user with higher privileges, could
perform actions with that user's credentials. The vulnerability is not
exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the Wagtail
admin. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail 2.7.2 (for the
LTS 2.7 branch) and Wagtail 2.8.1 (for the current 2.8 branch).

dropwizard-validation before versions 2.0.3 and 1.3.21 has a remote
code execution vulnerability. A server-side template injection was
identified in the self-validating feature enabling attackers to inject
arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
vulnerability. If you are using a self-validating bean an upgrade to
Dropwizard 1.3.21/2.0.3 or later is strongly recommended. The changes
introduced in Dropwizard 1.3.19 and 2.0.2 for CVE-2020-5245
unfortunately did not fix the underlying issue completely. The issue
has been fixed in dropwizard-validation 1.3.21 and 2.0.3 or later. We
strongly recommend upgrading to one of these versions.

Affected versions of Git have a vulnerability whereby Git can be
tricked into sending private credentials to a host controlled by an
attacker. This bug is similar to CVE-2020-5260(GHSA-qm7j-c969-7j4q).
The fix for that bug still left the door open for an exploit where
_some_ credential is leaked (but the attacker cannot control which
one). Git uses external "credential helper" programs to store and
retrieve passwords or other credentials from secure storage provided
by the operating system. Specially-crafted URLs that are considered
illegal as of the recently published Git versions can cause Git to
send a "blank" pattern to helpers, missing hostname and protocol
fields. Many helpers will interpret this as matching _any_ URL, and
will return some unspecified stored password, leaking the password to
an attacker's server. The vulnerability can be triggered by feeding a
malicious URL to `git clone`. However, the affected URLs look rather
suspicious; the likely vector would be through systems which
automatically clone URLs not visible to the user, such as Git
submodules, or package systems built around Git. The root of the
problem is in Git itself, which should not be feeding blank input to
helpers. However, the ability to exploit the vulnerability in practice
depends on which helpers are in use. Credential helpers which are
known to trigger the vulnerability: - Git's "store" helper - Git's
"cache" helper - the "osxkeychain" helper that ships in Git's
"contrib" directory Credential helpers which are known to be safe even
with vulnerable versions of Git: - Git Credential Manager for Windows
Any helper not in this list should be assumed to trigger the
vulnerability.

Reference: MISC:https://docs.rundeck.com/docs/history/3_2_x/version-3.2.6.html

In Rundeck before version 3.2.6, authenticated users can craft a
request that reveals Execution data and logs and Job details that they
are not authorized to see. Depending on the configuration and the way
that Rundeck is used, this could result in anything between a high
severity risk, or a very low risk. If access is tightly restricted and
all users on the system have access to all projects, this is not
really much of an issue. If access is wider and allows login for users
that do not have access to any projects, or project access is
restricted, there is a larger issue. If access is meant to be
restricted and secrets, sensitive data, or intellectual property are
exposed in Rundeck execution output and job data, the risk becomes
much higher. This vulnerability is patched in version 3.2.6

Reference: MISC:https://github.com/helm/helm/releases/tag/v3.2.0

Their is an information disclosure vulnerability in Helm from version
3.1.0 and before version 3.2.0. `lookup` is a Helm template function
introduced in Helm v3. It is able to lookup resources in the cluster
to check for the existence of specific resources and get details about
them. This can be used as part of the process to render templates. The
documented behavior of `helm template` states that it does not attach
to a remote cluster. However, a the recently added `lookup` template
function circumvents this restriction and connects to the cluster even
during `helm template` and `helm install|update|delete|rollback --dry-
run`. The user is not notified of this behavior. Running `helm
template` should not make calls to a cluster. This is different from
`install`, which is presumed to have access to a cluster in order to
load resources into Kubernetes. Helm 2 is unaffected by this
vulnerability. A malicious chart author could inject a `lookup` into a
chart that, when rendered through `helm template`, performs
unannounced lookups against the cluster a user&#39;s `KUBECONFIG` file
points to. This information can then be disclosed via the output of
`helm template`. This issue has been fixed in Helm 3.2.0

In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0,
passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to
one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and
others) may execute untrusted code. This problem is patched in jQuery
3.5.0.

In Wagtail before versions 2.7.2 and 2.8.2, a potential timing attack
exists on pages or documents that have been protected with a shared
password through Wagtail's "Privacy" controls. This password check is
performed through a character-by-character string comparison, and so
an attacker who is able to measure the time taken by this check to a
high degree of accuracy could potentially use timing differences to
gain knowledge of the password. This is understood to be feasible on a
local network, but not on the public internet. Privacy settings that
restrict access to pages/documents on a per-user or per-group basis
(as opposed to a shared password) are unaffected by this
vulnerability. This has been patched in 2.7.3, 2.8.2, 2.9.

defined amount of client memory (32bit unsigned -> 4GB) to an
intermediate buffer. This can be used to crash the client or store
information for later retrieval. This has been patched in 2.0.0.

In qutebrowser versions less than 1.11.1, reloading a page with
certificate errors shows a green URL. After a certificate error was
overridden by the user, qutebrowser displays the URL as yellow
(colors.statusbar.url.warn.fg). However, when the affected website was
subsequently loaded again, the URL was mistakenly displayed as green
(colors.statusbar.url.success_https). While the user already has seen
a certificate error prompt at this point (or set content.ssl_strict to
false, which is not recommended), this could still provide a false
sense of security. This has been fixed in 1.11.1 and 1.12.0. All
versions of qutebrowser are believed to be affected, though versions
before v0.11.x couldn't be tested. Backported patches for older
versions (greater than or equal to 1.4.0 and less than or equal to
1.10.2) are available, but no further releases are planned.

Name: CVE-2020-11069
Status: Candidate
Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/TYPO3/TYPO3.CMS/security/advisories/GHSA-pqg8-crx9-g8m4

In TYPO3 CMS 9.0.0 through 9.5.16 and 10.0.0 through 10.4.1, it has
been discovered that the backend user interface and install tool are
vulnerable to a same-site request forgery. A backend user can be
tricked into interacting with a malicious resource an attacker
previously managed to upload to the web server. Scripts are then
executed with the privileges of the victims' user session. In a worst-
case scenario, new admin users can be created which can directly be
used by an attacker. The vulnerability is basically a cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) triggered by a cross-site scripting
vulnerability (XSS) - but happens on the same target host - thus, it's
actually a same-site request forgery. Malicious payload such as HTML
containing JavaScript might be provided by either an authenticated
backend user or by a non-authenticated user using a third party
extension, e.g. file upload in a contact form with knowing the target
location. To be successful, the attacked victim requires an active and
valid backend or install tool user session at the time of the attack.
This has been fixed in 9.5.17 and 10.4.2. The deployment of additional
mitigation techniques is suggested as described below. - Sudo Mode
Extension This TYPO3 extension intercepts modifications to security
relevant database tables, e.g. those storing user accounts or storages
of the file abstraction layer. Modifications need to confirmed again
by the acting user providing their password again. This technique is
known as sudo mode. This way, unintended actions happening in the
background can be mitigated. - https://github.com/FriendsOfTYPO3/sudo-
mode - https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/sudo_mode - Content
Security Policy Content Security Policies tell (modern) browsers how
resources served a particular site are handled. It is also possible to
disallow script executions for specific locations. In a TYPO3 context,
it is suggested to disallow direct script execution at least for
locations /fileadmin/ and /uploads/.

In Anchore Engine version 0.7.0, a specially crafted container image
manifest, fetched from a registry, can be used to trigger a shell
escape flaw in the anchore engine analyzer service during an image
analysis process. The image analysis operation can only be executed by
an authenticated user via a valid API request to anchore engine, or if
an already added image that anchore is monitoring has its manifest
altered to exploit the same flaw. A successful attack can be used to
execute commands that run in the analyzer environment, with the same
permissions as the user that anchore engine is run as - including
access to the credentials that Engine uses to access its own database
which have read-write ability, as well as access to the running engien
analyzer service environment. By default Anchore Engine is released
and deployed as a container where the user is non-root, but if users
run Engine directly or explicitly set the user to 'root' then that
level of access may be gained in the execution environment where
Engine runs. This issue is fixed in version 0.7.1.

In Puma (RubyGem) before 4.3.5 and 3.12.6, a client could smuggle a
request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to
another unknown client. If the proxy uses persistent connections and
the client adds another request in via HTTP pipelining, the proxy may
mistake it as the first request's body. Puma, however, would see it as
two requests, and when processing the second request, send back a
response that the proxy does not expect. If the proxy has reused the
persistent connection to Puma to send another request for a different
client, the second response from the first client will be sent to the
second client. This is a similar but different vulnerability from
CVE-2020-11076. The problem has been fixed in Puma 3.12.6 and Puma
4.3.5.

In nghttp2 before version 1.41.0, the overly large HTTP/2 SETTINGS
frame payload causes denial of service. The proof of concept attack
involves a malicious client constructing a SETTINGS frame with a
length of 14,400 bytes (2400 individual settings entries) over and
over again. The attack causes the CPU to spike at 100%. nghttp2
v1.41.0 fixes this vulnerability. There is a workaround to this
vulnerability. Implement nghttp2_on_frame_recv_callback callback, and
if received frame is SETTINGS frame and the number of settings entries
are large (e.g., > 32), then drop the connection.

In Indy Node 1.12.2, there is an Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
vulnerability. Indy Node has a bug in TAA handling code. The current
primary can be crashed with a malformed transaction from a client,
which leads to a view change. Repeated rapid view changes have the
potential of bringing down the network. This is fixed in version
1.12.3.

In Weave Net before version 2.6.3, an attacker able to run a process
as root in a container is able to respond to DNS requests from the
host and thereby insert themselves as a fake service. In a cluster
with an IPv4 internal network, if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the
host (via ipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline), it will be either
unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but it's pretty likely
that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, ie
/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//forwarding == 0. Also by default,
/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf//accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2
sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and
configure the IPv6 stack using them. By sending rogue router
advertisements, an attacker can reconfigure the host to redirect part
or all of the IPv6 traffic of the host to the attacker controlled
container. Even if there was no IPv6 traffic before, if the DNS
returns A (IPv4) and AAAA (IPv6) records, many HTTP libraries will try
to connect via IPv6 first then fallback to IPv4, giving an opportunity
to the attacker to respond. If by chance you also have on the host a
vulnerability like last year's RCE in apt (CVE-2019-3462), you can now
escalate to the host. Weave Net version 2.6.3 disables the accept_ra
option on the veth devices that it creates.

Hyperledger Indy Node is the server portion of a distributed ledger
purpose-built for decentralized identity. In Hyperledger Indy before
version 1.12.4, there is lack of signature verification on a specific
transaction which enables an attacker to make certain unauthorized
alterations to the ledger. Updating a DID with a nym transaction will
be written to the ledger if neither ROLE or VERKEY are being changed,
regardless of sender. A malicious DID with no particular role can ask
an update for another DID (but cannot modify its verkey or role). This
is bad because 1) Any DID can write a nym transaction to the ledger
(i.e., any DID can spam the ledger with nym transactions), 2) Any DID
can change any other DID's alias, 3) The update transaction modifies
the ledger metadata associated with a DID.

Reference: MISC:https://github.com/rainlab/debugbar-plugin/commit/86dd29f9866d712de7d98f5f9dc67751b82ecd18

The October CMS debugbar plugin before version 3.1.0 contains a
feature where it will log all requests (and all information pertaining
to each request including session data) whenever it is enabled. This
presents a problem if the plugin is ever enabled on a system that is
open to untrusted users as the potential exists for them to use this
feature to view all requests being made to the application and obtain
sensitive information from those requests. There even exists the
potential for account takeovers of authenticated users by non-
authenticated public users, which would then lead to a number of other
potential issues as an attacker could theoretically get full access to
the system if the required conditions existed. Issue has been patched
in v3.1.0 by locking down access to the debugbar to all users; it now
requires an authenticated backend user with a specifically enabled
permission before it is even usable, and the feature that allows
access to stored request information is restricted behind a different
permission that's more restrictive.

Reference: CONFIRM:https://bitbucket.org/meszarv/webswing/issues/375/webswing-jslink-mechanism-remote-code
Reference: CONFIRM:https://www.webswing.org/docs/2.6/discover/release_notes.html#release-notes-2-6-12

JsLink in Webswing before 2.6.12 LTS, and 2.7.x and 20.x before 20.1,
allows remote code execution.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-11104
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/issues/625

An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal through 1.3.0.
Serialization of an (initialized) C/C++ long double variable into a
BinaryArchive or PortableBinaryArchive leaks several bytes of stack or
heap memory, from which sensitive information (such as memory layout
or private keys) can be gleaned if the archive is distributed outside
of a trusted context.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-11105
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/USCiLab/cereal/issues/636

An issue was discovered in USC iLab cereal through 1.3.0. It employs
caching of std::shared_ptr values, using the raw pointer address as a
unique identifier. This becomes problematic if an std::shared_ptr
variable goes out of scope and is freed, and a new std::shared_ptr is
allocated at the same address. Serialization fidelity thereby becomes
dependent upon memory layout. In short, serialized std::shared_ptr
variables cannot always be expected to serialize back into their
original values. This can have any number of consequences, depending
on the context within which this manifests.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-11106
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/trippo/ResponsiveFilemanager/issues/603

An issue was discovered in Responsive Filemanager through 9.14.0. In
the dialog.php page, the session variable $_SESSION['RF']["view_type"]
wasn't sanitized if it was already set. This made stored XSS possible
if one opens ajax_calls.php and uses the "view" action and places a
payload in the type parameter, and then returns to the dialog.php
page. This occurs because ajax_calls.php was also able to set the
$_SESSION['RF']["view_type"] variable, but there it wasn't sanitized.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-11107
Status: Candidate

Reference: MISC:http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/164292/XAMPP-7.4.3-Privilege-Escalation.html

An issue was discovered in XAMPP before 7.2.29, 7.3.x before 7.3.16 ,
and 7.4.x before 7.4.4 on Windows. An unprivileged user can change a
.exe configuration in xampp-contol.ini for all users (including
admins) to enable arbitrary command execution.

The Gravity updater in Pi-hole through 4.4 allows an authenticated
adversary to upload arbitrary files. This can be abused for Remote
Code Execution by writing to a PHP file in the web directory. (Also,
it can be used in conjunction with the sudo rule for the www-data user
to escalate privileges to root.) The code error is in
gravity_DownloadBlocklistFromUrl in gravity.sh.

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in ManageEngine
ADSelfService Plus before build 6003 because it does not properly
enforce user privileges associated with a Certificate dialog. This
vulnerability could allow an unauthenticated attacker to escalate
privileges on a Windows host. An attacker does not require any
privilege on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.
One option is the self-service option on the Windows login screen.
Upon selecting this option, the thick-client software is launched,
which connects to a remote ADSelfService Plus server to facilitate
self-service operations. An unauthenticated attacker having physical
access to the host could trigger a security alert by supplying a self-
signed SSL certificate to the client. The View Certificate option from
the security alert allows an attacker to export a displayed
certificate to a file. This can further cascade to a dialog that can
open Explorer as SYSTEM. By navigating from Explorer to
\windows\system32, cmd.exe can be launched as a SYSTEM.

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through
5.6.2. mpol_parse_str in mm/mempolicy.c has a stack-based out-of-
bounds write because an empty nodelist is mishandled during mount
option parsing, aka CID-aa9f7d5172fa. NOTE: Someone in the security
community disagrees that this is a vulnerability because the issue &#8220;is
a bug in parsing mount options which can only be specified by a
privileged user, so triggering the bug does not grant any powers not
already held.&#8221;.

The ZlibDecoders in Netty 4.1.x before 4.1.46 allow for unbounded
memory allocation while decoding a ZlibEncoded byte stream. An
attacker could send a large ZlibEncoded byte stream to the Netty
server, forcing the server to allocate all of its free memory to a
single decoder.

Mids' Reborn Hero Designer 2.6.0.7 has an elevation of privilege
vulnerability due to default and insecure permissions being set for
the installation folder. By default, the Authenticated Users group has
Modify permissions to the installation folder. Because of this, any
user on the system can replace binaries or plant malicious DLLs to
obtain elevated, or different, privileges, depending on the context of
the user that runs the application.

Mids' Reborn Hero Designer 2.6.0.7 downloads the update manifest, as
well as update files, over cleartext HTTP. Additionally, the
application does not perform file integrity validation for files after
download. An attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack against
this connection and replace executable files with malicious versions,
which the operating system then executes under the context of the user
running Hero Designer.

Name: CVE-2020-11623
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/avertx-ip-cameras-vulnerabilities/

An issue was discovered in AvertX Auto focus Night Vision HD
Indoor/Outdoor IP Dome Camera HD838 and Night Vision HD Indoor/Outdoor
Mini IP Bullet Camera HD438. An attacker with physical access to the
UART interface could access additional diagnostic and configuration
functionalities as well as the camera's bootloader. Successful
exploitation could compromise confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of the affected system. It could even render the device
inoperable.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-11624
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/avertx-ip-cameras-vulnerabilities/

An issue was discovered in AvertX Auto focus Night Vision HD
Indoor/Outdoor IP Dome Camera HD838 and Night Vision HD Indoor/Outdoor
Mini IP Bullet Camera HD438. They do not require users to change the
default password for the admin account. They only show a pop-up window
suggesting a change but there's no enforcement. An administrator can
click Cancel and proceed to use the device without changing the
password. Additionally, they disclose the default username within the
login.js script. Since many attacks for IoT devices, including malware
and exploits, are based on the usage of default credentials, it makes
these cameras an easy target for malicious actors.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-11625
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/avertx-ip-cameras-vulnerabilities/

An issue was discovered in AvertX Auto focus Night Vision HD
Indoor/Outdoor IP Dome Camera HD838 and Night Vision HD Indoor/Outdoor
Mini IP Bullet Camera HD438. Failed web UI login attempts elicit
different responses depending on whether a user account exists.
Because the responses indicate whether a submitted username is valid
or not, they make it easier to identify legitimate usernames. If a
login request is sent to ISAPI/Security/sessionLogin/capabilities
using a username that exists, it will return the value of the salt
given to that username, even if the password is incorrect. However, if
a login request is sent using a username that is not present in the
database, it will return an empty salt value. This allows attackers to
enumerate legitimate usernames, facilitating brute-force attacks.
NOTE: this is different from CVE-2020-7057.

An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before
7.3.1.2. It is intended to support restriction of available remote
protocols (CMP, ACME, REST, etc.) through the system configuration.
These restrictions can be bypassed by modifying the URI string from a
client. (EJBCA's internal access control restrictions are still in
place, and each respective protocol must be configured to allow for
enrollment.)

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-11629
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://support.primekey.com/news/primekey-announcements

An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before
7.3.1.2. The External Command Certificate Validator, which allows
administrators to upload external linters to validate certificates, is
supposed to save uploaded test certificates to the server. An attacker
who has gained access to the CA UI could exploit this to upload
malicious scripts to the server. (Risks associated with this issue
alone are negligible unless a malicious user already has gained access
to the CA UI through other means, as a trusted user is already trusted
to upload scripts by virtue of having access to the validator.)

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-11631
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://support.primekey.com/news/primekey-announcements

An issue was discovered in EJBCA before 6.15.2.6 and 7.x before
7.3.1.2. An error state can be generated in the CA UI by a malicious
user. This, in turn, allows exploitation of other bugs. This follow-on
exploitation can lead to privilege escalation and remote code
execution. (This is exploitable only when at least one accessible port
lacks a requirement for client certificate authentication. These ports
are 8442 or 8080 in a standard installation.)

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for Kong)
through 2.0.3. The admin API port may be accessible on interfaces
other than 127.0.0.1. NOTE: The vendor argue that this CVE is not a
vulnerability because it has an inaccurate bug scope and patch links.
&#8220;1) Inaccurate Bug Scope - The issue scope was on Kong's docker-
compose template, and not Kong's docker image itself. In reality, this
issue is not associated with any version of the Kong gateway. As such,
the description stating &#8216;An issue was discovered in docker-kong (for
Kong) through 2.0.3.&#8217; is incorrect. This issue only occurs if a user
decided to spin up Kong via docker-compose without following the
security documentation. The docker-compose template is meant for users
to quickly get started with Kong, and is meant for development
purposes only. 2) Incorrect Patch Links - The CVE currently points to
a documentation improvement as a &#8220;Patch&#8221; link: https://github.com/Kong
/docs.konghq.com/commit/d693827c32144943a2f45abc017c1321b33ff611.This
link actually points to an improvement Kong Inc made for fool-
proofing. However, instructions for how to protect the admin API were
already well-documented here: https://docs.konghq.com/2.0.x/secure-
admin-api/#network-layer-access-restrictions , which was first
published back in 2017 (as shown in this commit: https://github.com/Ko
ng/docs.konghq.com/commit/e99cf875d875dd84fdb751079ac37882c9972949)

Github Repo to this issue) on the Hyperlink list does not include any
meaningful information on this topic.&#8221;

An issue was discovered in Stormshield SNS 3.8.0. Authenticated Stored
XSS in the admin login panel leads to SSL VPN credential theft. A
malicious disclaimer file can be uploaded from the admin panel. The
resulting file is rendered on the authentication interface of the
admin panel. It is possible to inject malicious HTML content in order
to execute JavaScript inside a victim's browser. This results in a
stored XSS on the authentication interface of the admin panel.
Moreover, an unsecured authentication form is present on the
authentication interface of the SSL VPN captive portal. Users are
allowed to save their credentials inside the browser. If an
administrator saves his credentials through this unsecured form, these
credentials could be stolen via the stored XSS on the admin panel
without user interaction. Another possible exploitation would be
modification of the authentication form of the admin panel into a
malicious form.

** DISPUTED ** snd_ctl_elem_add in sound/core/control.c in the Linux
kernel through 5.6.3 has a count=info->owner line, which later affects
a private_size*count multiplication for unspecified "interesting side
effects." NOTE: kernel engineers dispute this finding, because it
could be relevant only if new callers were added that were unfamiliar
with the misuse of the info->owner field to represent data unrelated
to the "owner" concept. The existing callers, SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_ADD
and SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_REPLACE, have been designed to misuse the
info->owner field in a safe way.

Reference: SUSE:openSUSE-SU-2020:0599
Reference: URL:http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-05/msg00006.html

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.13.x, allowing guest OS users
to cause a denial of service or possibly gain privileges because of
missing memory barriers in read-write unlock paths. The read-write
unlock paths don't contain a memory barrier. On Arm, this means a
processor is allowed to re-order the memory access with the preceding
ones. In other words, the unlock may be seen by another processor
before all the memory accesses within the "critical" section. As a
consequence, it may be possible to have a writer executing a critical
section at the same time as readers or another writer. In other words,
many of the assumptions (e.g., a variable cannot be modified after a
check) in the critical sections are not safe anymore. The read-write
locks are used in hypercalls (such as grant-table ones), so a
malicious guest could exploit the race. For instance, there is a small
window where Xen can leak memory if XENMAPSPACE_grant_table is used
concurrently. A malicious guest may be able to leak memory, or cause a
hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Information
leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded.

success, and a negative number for errors. The fix for CVE-2017-12135
introduced a path through grant copy handling where success may be
returned to the caller without any action taken. In particular, the
status fields of individual operations are left uninitialised, and may
result in errant behaviour in the caller of GNTTABOP_copy. A buggy or
malicious guest can construct its grant table in such a way that, when
a backend domain tries to copy a grant, it hits the incorrect exit
path. This returns success to the caller without doing anything, which
may cause crashes or other incorrect behaviour.

Istio through 1.5.1 and Envoy through 1.14.1 have a data-leak issue.
If there is a TCP connection (negotiated with SNI over HTTPS) to
*.example.com, a request for a domain concurrently configured

behind *.example.com. The outcome should instead be 421 Misdirected
