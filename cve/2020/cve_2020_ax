A Spring MVC or Spring WebFlux application running on JDK 9+ may be
vulnerable to remote code execution (RCE) via data binding. The
specific exploit requires the application to run on Tomcat as a WAR
deployment. If the application is deployed as a Spring Boot executable
jar, i.e. the default, it is not vulnerable to the exploit. However,
the nature of the vulnerability is more general, and there may be
other ways to exploit it.

incomplete fix for
[CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342).
A successful exploit allows attackers to run arbitrary commands on the
host system where the Snyk CLI is installed by passing in crafted
command line flags. In order to exploit this vulnerability, a user
would have to execute the snyk test command on untrusted files. In
most cases, an attacker positioned to control the command line
arguments to the Snyk CLI would already be positioned to execute
arbitrary commands. However, this could be abused in specific
scenarios, such as continuous integration pipelines, where developers
can control the arguments passed to the Snyk CLI to leverage this
component as part of a wider attack against an integration/build
pipeline. This issue has been addressed in the latest Snyk Docker
images available at https://hub.docker.com/r/snyk/snyk as of
2022-11-29. Images downloaded and built prior to that date should be
updated. The issue has also been addressed in the Snyk TeamCity CI/CD

When compressing or decompressing elliptic curve points using the
Sweet B library, an incorrect choice of sign bit is used. An attacker
with user level privileges and no other user's assistance can exploit
this vulnerability with only knowledge of the public key and the
library. The resulting output may cause an error when used in other
operations; for instance, verification of a valid signature under a
decompressed public key may fail. This may be leveraged by an attacker
to cause an error scenario in applications which use the library,
resulting in a limited denial of service for an individual user. The
scope of impact cannot extend to other components.

Western Digital has identified a weakness in the UFS standard that
could result in a security vulnerability. This vulnerability may exist
in some systems where the Host boot ROM code implements the UFS Boot
feature to boot from UFS compliant storage devices. The UFS Boot
feature, as specified in the UFS standard, is provided by UFS devices
to support platforms that need to download the system boot loader from
external non-volatile storage locations. Several scenarios have been
identified in which adversaries may disable the boot capability, or
revert to an old boot loader code, if the host boot ROM code is
improperly implemented. UFS Host Boot ROM implementers may be impacted
by this vulnerability. UFS devices are only impacted when connected to
a vulnerable UFS Host and are not independently impacted by this
vulnerability. When present, the vulnerability is in the UFS Host
implementation and is not a vulnerability in Western Digital UFS
Devices. Western Digital has provided details of the vulnerability to
the JEDEC standards body, multiple vendors of host processors, and
software solutions providers.

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability was found on Western
Digital My Cloud Home, My Cloud Home Duo, and SanDisk ibi that could
allow an attacker accessing the system locally to read information
from /etc/version file. This vulnerability can only be exploited by
chaining it with another issue. If an attacker is able to carry out a
remote code execution attack, they can gain access to the vulnerable
file, due to the presence of insecure functions in code. User
interaction is required for exploitation. Exploiting the vulnerability
could result in exposure of information, ability to modify files,
memory access errors, or system crashes.

arm: guest_physmap_remove_page not removing the p2m mappings The
functions to remove one or more entries from a guest p2m pagetable on
Arm (p2m_remove_mapping, guest_physmap_remove_page, and p2m_set_entry
with mfn set to INVALID_MFN) do not actually clear the pagetable entry
if the entry doesn't have the valid bit set. It is possible to have a
valid pagetable entry without the valid bit set when a guest operating
system uses set/way cache maintenance instructions. For instance, a
guest issuing a set/way cache maintenance instruction, then calling
the XENMEM_decrease_reservation hypercall to give back memory pages to
Xen, might be able to retain access to those pages even after Xen
started reusing them for other purposes.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/25/3

A PV guest could DoS Xen while unmapping a grant To address XSA-380,
reference counting was introduced for grant mappings for the case
where a PV guest would have the IOMMU enabled. PV guests can request
two forms of mappings. When both are in use for any individual
mapping, unmapping of such a mapping can be requested in two steps.
The reference count for such a mapping would then mistakenly be
decremented twice. Underflow of the counters gets detected, resulting
in the triggering of a hypervisor bug check.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/25/4

Insufficient cleanup of passed-through device IRQs The management of
IRQs associated with physical devices exposed to x86 HVM guests
involves an iterative operation in particular when cleaning up after
the guest's use of the device. In the case where an interrupt is not
quiescent yet at the time this cleanup gets invoked, the cleanup
attempt may be scheduled to be retried. When multiple interrupts are
involved, this scheduling of a retry may get erroneously skipped. At
the same time pointers may get cleared (resulting in a de-reference of
NULL) and freed (resulting in a use-after-free), while other code
would continue to assume them to be valid.

Linux PV device frontends vulnerable to attacks by backends T[his CNA

case, they assume that a following removal of the granted access will
always succeed, which is not true in case the backend has mapped the
granted page between those two operations. As a result the backend can
keep access to the memory page of the guest no matter how the page
will be used after the frontend I/O has finished. The xenbus driver
has a similar problem, as it doesn't check the success of removing the
granted access of a shared ring buffer. blkfront: CVE-2022-23036
netfront: CVE-2022-23037 scsifront: CVE-2022-23038 gntalloc:
CVE-2022-23039 xenbus: CVE-2022-23040 blkfront, netfront, scsifront,
usbfront, dmabuf, xenbus, 9p, kbdfront, and pvcalls are using a
functionality to delay freeing a grant reference until it is no longer
in use, but the freeing of the related data page is not synchronized
with dropping the granted access. As a result the backend can keep
access to the memory page even after it has been freed and then re-
used for a different purpose. CVE-2022-23041 netfront will fail a
BUG_ON() assertion if it fails to revoke access in the rx path. This
will result in a Denial of Service (DoS) situation of the guest which
can be triggered by the backend. CVE-2022-23042

The e1000 network adapters permit a variety of modifications to an
Ethernet packet when it is being transmitted. These include the
insertion of IP and TCP checksums, insertion of an Ethernet VLAN
header, and TCP segmentation offload ("TSO"). The e1000 device model
uses an on-stack buffer to generate the modified packet header when
simulating these modifications on transmitted packets. When checksum
offload is requested for a transmitted packet, the e1000 device model
used a guest-provided value to specify the checksum offset in the on-
stack buffer. The offset was not validated for certain packet types. A
misbehaving bhyve guest could overwrite memory in the bhyve process on
the host, possibly leading to code execution in the host context. The
bhyve process runs in a Capsicum sandbox, which (depending on the
FreeBSD version and bhyve configuration) limits the impact of
exploiting this issue.

NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service
(or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together
with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not
affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data,
given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability
is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize
function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that
parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient
iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N
would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use
cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also
remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be
triggered.

The implementation of lib9p's handling of RWALK messages was missing a

check means that the receipt of a specially crafted message will cause
lib9p to overwrite unrelated memory. The bug can be triggered by a

the host, subject to bhyve's Capsicum sandbox.

Reference: URL:https://security.freebsd.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-22:15.ping.asc

ping reads raw IP packets from the network to process responses in the
pr_pack() function. As part of processing a response ping has to
reconstruct the IP header, the ICMP header and if present a "quoted
packet," which represents the packet that generated an ICMP error. The
quoted packet again has an IP header and an ICMP header. The pr_pack()
copies received IP and ICMP headers into stack buffers for further
processing. In so doing, it fails to take into account the possible
presence of IP option headers following the IP header in either the
response or the quoted packet. When IP options are present, pr_pack()
overflows the destination buffer by up to 40 bytes. The memory safety
bugs described above can be triggered by a remote host, causing the
ping program to crash. The ping process runs in a capability mode
sandbox on all affected versions of FreeBSD and is thus very
constrained in how it can interact with the rest of the system at the
point where the bug can occur.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/22/1

USBView 2.1 before 2.2 allows some local users (e.g., ones logged in
via SSH) to execute arbitrary code as root because certain Polkit
settings (e.g., allow_any=yes) for pkexec disable the authentication
requirement. Code execution can, for example, use the --gtk-module
option. This affects Ubuntu, Debian, and Gentoo.

io_uring use work_flags to determine which identity need to grab from
the calling process to make sure it is consistent with the calling
process when executing IORING_OP. Some operations are missing some
types, which can lead to incorrect reference counts which can then
lead to a double free. We recommend upgrading the kernel past commit

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/18/3

JMSSink in all versions of Log4j 1.x is vulnerable to deserialization
of untrusted data when the attacker has write access to the Log4j
configuration or if the configuration references an LDAP service the
attacker has access to. The attacker can provide a
TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName configuration causing JMSSink to
perform JNDI requests that result in remote code execution in a
similar fashion to CVE-2021-4104. Note this issue only affects Log4j
1.x when specifically configured to use JMSSink, which is not the
default. Apache Log4j 1.2 reached end of life in August 2015. Users
should upgrade to Log4j 2 as it addresses numerous other issues from
the previous versions.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/18/4

By design, the JDBCAppender in Log4j 1.2.x accepts an SQL statement as
a configuration parameter where the values to be inserted are
converters from PatternLayout. The message converter, %m, is likely to
always be included. This allows attackers to manipulate the SQL by
entering crafted strings into input fields or headers of an
application that are logged allowing unintended SQL queries to be
executed. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.x when specifically
configured to use the JDBCAppender, which is not the default.
Beginning in version 2.0-beta8, the JDBCAppender was re-introduced
with proper support for parameterized SQL queries and further
customization over the columns written to in logs. Apache Log4j 1.2
reached end of life in August 2015. Users should upgrade to Log4j 2 as
it addresses numerous other issues from the previous versions.

ESAPI (The OWASP Enterprise Security API) is a free, open source, web
application security control library. Prior to version 2.3.0.0, the
default implementation of `Validator.getValidDirectoryPath(String,
String, File, boolean)` may incorrectly treat the tested input string
as a child of the specified parent directory. This potentially could
allow control-flow bypass checks to be defeated if an attack can
specify the entire string representing the 'input' path. This
vulnerability is patched in release 2.3.0.0 of ESAPI. As a workaround,
it is possible to write one's own implementation of the Validator
interface. However, maintainers do not recommend this.

There exists an unchecked length field in UBoot. The U-Boot DFU
implementation does not bound the length field in USB DFU download
setup packets, and it does not verify that the transfer direction
corresponds to the specified command. Consequently, if a physical
attacker crafts a USB DFU download setup packet with a `wLength`
greater than 4096 bytes, they can write beyond the heap-allocated
request buffer.

Galaxy is an open-source platform for data analysis. An arbitrary file
read exists in Galaxy 22.01 and Galaxy 22.05 due to the switch to
Gunicorn, which can be used to read any file accessible to the
operating system user under which Galaxy is running. This
vulnerability affects Galaxy 22.01 and higher, after the switch to
gunicorn, which serve static contents directly. Additionally, the
vulnerability is mitigated when using Nginx or Apache to serve
/static/* contents, instead of Galaxy's internal middleware. This
issue has been patched in commit `e5e6bda4f` and will be included in
future releases. Users are advised to manually patch their
installations. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

containerd is an open source container runtime. A bug was found in
containerd's CRI implementation where a user can exhaust memory on the
host. In the CRI stream server, a goroutine is launched to handle
terminal resize events if a TTY is requested. If the user's process
fails to launch due to, for example, a faulty command, the goroutine
will be stuck waiting to send without a receiver, resulting in a
memory leak. Kubernetes and crictl can both be configured to use
containerd's CRI implementation and the stream server is used for
handling container IO. This bug has been fixed in containerd 1.6.12
and 1.5.16. Users should update to these versions to resolve the
issue. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that only trusted images
and commands are used and that only trusted users have permissions to
execute commands in running containers.

Passeo is an open source python password generator. Versions prior to
1.0.5 rely on the python `random` library for random value selection.
The python `random` library warns that it should not be used for
security purposes due to its reliance on a non-cryptographically
secure random number generator. As a result a motivated attacker may
be able to guess generated passwords. This issue has been addressed in
version 1.0.5. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

Nokogiri is an open source XML and HTML library for the Ruby
programming language. Nokogiri `1.13.8` and `1.13.9` fail to check the
return value from `xmlTextReaderExpand` in the method
`Nokogiri::XML::Reader#attribute_hash`. This can lead to a null
pointer exception when invalid markup is being parsed. For
applications using `XML::Reader` to parse untrusted inputs, this may
potentially be a vector for a denial of service attack. Users are
advised to upgrade to Nokogiri `>= 1.13.10`. Users may be able to
search their code for calls to either `XML::Reader#attributes` or
`XML::Reader#attribute_hash` to determine if they are affected.

Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform. In
versions of the sentry python library prior to 22.11.0 an attacker
with a known valid invite link could manipulate a cookie to allow the
same invite link to be reused on multiple accounts when joining an
organization. As a result an attacker with a valid invite link can
create multiple users and join an organization they may not have been
originally invited to. This issue was patched in version 22.11.0.
Sentry SaaS customers do not need to take action. Self-hosted Sentry
installs on systems which can not upgrade can disable the invite
functionality until they are ready to deploy the patched version by
editing their `sentry.conf.py` file (usually located at `~/.sentry/`).

when these dialogs were provided with malicious HTML content. This can
occur in plugins that use the alert or confirm dialogs, such as in the
`image` plugin, which presents these dialogs when certain errors
occur. The vulnerability allowed arbitrary JavaScript execution when
an alert presented in the TinyMCE UI for the current user. This
vulnerability has been patched in TinyMCE 5.10.7 and TinyMCE 6.3.1 by
ensuring HTML sanitization was still performed after unwrapping
invalid elements. Users are advised to upgrade to either 5.10.7 or
6.3.1. Users unable to upgrade may ensure the the
`images_upload_handler` returns a valid value as per the
images_upload_handler documentation.

go-merkledag implements the 'DAGService' interface and adds two ipld
node types, Protobuf and Raw for the ipfs project. A `ProtoNode` may
be modified in such a way as to cause various encode errors which will
trigger a panic on common method calls that don't allow for error
returns. A `ProtoNode` should only be able to encode to valid DAG-PB,
attempting to encode invalid DAG-PB forms will result in an error from
the codec. Manipulation of an existing (newly created or decoded)
`ProtoNode` using the modifier methods did not account for certain
states that would place the `ProtoNode` into an unencodeable form. Due
to conformance with the [`github.com/ipfs/go-block-
format#Block`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-block-
format#Block) and [`github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-
format#Node`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/ipfs/go-ipld-format#Node)
interfaces, certain methods, which internally require a re-encode if
state has changed, will panic due to the inability to return an error.
This issue has been addressed across a number of pull requests. Users
are advised to upgrade to version 0.8.1 for a complete set of fixes.
Users unable to upgrade may attempt to mitigate this issue by
sanitising inputs when allowing user-input to set a new `CidBuilder`
on a `ProtoNode` and by sanitising `Tsize` (`Link#Size`) values such
that they are a reasonable byte-size for sub-DAGs where derived from
user-input.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/TYPO3/html-sanitizer/security/advisories/GHSA-hvwx-qh2h-xcfj

HTML sanitizer is written in PHP, aiming to provide XSS-safe markup
based on explicitly allowed tags, attributes and values. In versions
prior to 1.5.0 or 2.1.1, malicious markup used in a sequence with
special HTML CDATA sections cannot be filtered and sanitized due to a
parsing issue in the upstream package masterminds/html5. This allows
bypassing the cross-site scripting mechanism of typo3/html-sanitizer.
The upstream package masterminds/html5 provides HTML raw text elements
(`script`, `style`, `noframes`, `noembed` and `iframe`) as DOMText
nodes, which were not processed and sanitized further. None of the
mentioned elements were defined in the default builder configuration,
that's why only custom behaviors, using one of those tag names, were
vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This issue has been fixed in
versions 1.5.0 and 2.1.1.

TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system. In
versions prior to 9.5.38, 10.4.33, 11.5.20, and 12.1.1, requesting
invalid or non-existing resources via HTTP triggers the page error
handler, which again could retrieve content to be shown as an error
message from another page. This leads to a scenario in which the
application is calling itself recursively - amplifying the impact of
the initial attack until the limits of the web server are exceeded.
This vulnerability is very similar, but not identical, to the one
described in CVE-2021-21359. This issue is patched in versions 9.5.38

Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform
for releasing software changes, and Spinnaker's Rosco microservice
produces machine images. Rosco prior to versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and
1.27.3 does not property mask secrets generated via packer builds.
This can lead to exposure of sensitive AWS credentials in packer log
files. Versions 1.29.2, 1.28.4, and 1.27.3 of Rosco contain fixes for
this issue. A workaround is available. It's recommended to use short
lived credentials via role assumption and IAM profiles. Additionally,
credentials can be set in `/home/spinnaker/.aws/credentials` and
`/home/spinnaker/.aws/config` as a volume mount for Rosco pods vs.
setting credentials in roscos bake config properties. Last even with
those it's recommend to use IAM Roles vs. long lived credentials. This
drastically mitigates the risk of credentials exposure. If users have
used static credentials, it's recommended to purge any bake logs for
AWS, evaluate whether AWS_ACCESS_KEY, SECRET_KEY and/or other
sensitive data has been introduced in log files and bake job logs.
Then, rotate these credentials and evaluate potential improper use of
those credentials.

contain a potential attack via Improper Verification of Cryptographic
Signature, affecting anyone using the tendermint-light-client and
related packages to perform light client verification (e.g. IBC-rs,
Hermes). The light client does not check that the chain IDs of the
trusted and untrusted headers match, resulting in a possible attack
vector where someone who finds a header from an untrusted chain that
satisfies all other verification conditions (e.g. enough overlapping
validator signatures) could fool a light client. The attack vector is
currently theoretical, and no proof-of-concept exists yet to exploit
it on live networks. This issue is patched in version 0.28.0. There

Weave GitOps is a simple open source developer platform for people who
want cloud native applications, without needing Kubernetes expertise.
A vulnerability in GitOps run could allow a local user or process to
alter a Kubernetes cluster's resources. GitOps run has a local S3
bucket which it uses for synchronizing files that are later applied
against a Kubernetes cluster. Its endpoint had no security controls to
block unauthorized access, therefore allowing local users (and
processes) on the same machine to see and alter the bucket content. By
leveraging this vulnerability, an attacker could pick a workload of
their choosing and inject it into the S3 bucket, which resulted in the
successful deployment in the target cluster, without the need to
provide any credentials to either the S3 bucket nor the target
Kubernetes cluster. There are no known workarounds for this issue,
please upgrade. This vulnerability has been fixed by commits 75268c4
and 966823b. Users should upgrade to Weave GitOps version >= v0.12.0
released on 08/12/2022. ### Workarounds There is no workaround for

Git is distributed revision control system. gitattributes are a
mechanism to allow defining attributes for paths. These attributes can
be defined by adding a `.gitattributes` file to the repository, which
contains a set of file patterns and the attributes that should be set
for paths matching this pattern. When parsing gitattributes, multiple
integer overflows can occur when there is a huge number of path
patterns, a huge number of attributes for a single pattern, or when
the declared attribute names are huge. These overflows can be
triggered via a crafted `.gitattributes` file that may be part of the
commit history. Git silently splits lines longer than 2KB when parsing
gitattributes from a file, but not when parsing them from the index.
Consequentially, the failure mode depends on whether the file exists
in the working tree, the index or both. This integer overflow can
result in arbitrary heap reads and writes, which may result in remote
code execution. The problem has been patched in the versions published
on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

MindsDB is an open source machine learning platform. An unsafe
extraction is being performed using `shutil.unpack_archive()` from a
remotely retrieved tarball. Which may lead to the writing of the
extracted files to an unintended location. This vulnerability is
sometimes called a **TarSlip** or a **ZipSlip variant**. Unpacking
files using the high-level function `shutil.unpack_archive()` from a
potentially malicious tarball without validating that the destination
file path remained within the intended destination directory may cause
files to be overwritten outside the destination directory. An attacker
could craft a malicious tarball with a filename path, such as
`../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`, and then serve the archive
remotely using a personal bucket `s3`, thus, retrieve the tarball
through **mindsdb** and overwrite the system files of the hosting
server. This issue has been addressed in version 22.11.4.3. Users are
advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid ingesting
archives from untrusted sources.

In versions prior to 0.8.1, the linux-loader crate uses the offsets
and sizes provided in the ELF headers to determine the offsets to read
from. If those offsets point beyond the end of the file this could
lead to Virtual Machine Monitors using the `linux-loader` crate
entering an infinite loop if the ELF header of the kernel they are
loading was modified in a malicious manner. This issue has been
addressed in 0.8.1. The issue can be mitigated by ensuring that only
trusted kernel images are loaded or by verifying that the headers do
not point beyond the end of the file.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts, pre-configured Kubernetes
resources. Versions prior to 3.10.3 are subject to NULL Pointer
Dereference in the _repo_package. The _repo_ package contains a
handler that processes the index file of a repository. For example,
the Helm client adds references to chart repositories where charts are
managed. The _repo_ package parses the index file of the repository
and loads it into structures Go can work with. Some index files can
cause array data structures to be created causing a memory violation.
Applications that use the _repo_ package in the Helm SDK to parse an
index file can suffer a Denial of Service when that input causes a
panic that cannot be recovered from. The Helm Client will panic with
an index file that causes a memory violation panic. Helm is not a long
running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm
client. This issue has been patched in 3.10.3. SDK users can validate
index files that are correctly formatted before passing them to the
_repo_ functions.

APOC (Awesome Procedures on Cypher) is an add-on library for Neo4j
that provides hundreds of procedures and functions. A path traversal
vulnerability found in the apoc.export.* procedures of apoc plugins in
Neo4j Graph database. The issue allows a malicious actor to
potentially break out of the expected directory. The vulnerability is
such that files could only be created but not overwritten. For the
vulnerability to be exploited, an attacker would need access to
execute an arbitrary query, either by having access to an
authenticated Neo4j client, or a Cypher injection vulnerability in an
application. The minimum versions containing patch for this
vulnerability are 4.4.0.12 and 4.3.0.12 and 5.3.1. As a workaround,
you can control the allowlist of the procedures that can be used in
your system, and/or turn off local file access by setting
apoc.export.file.enabled=false.

LiteDB is a small, fast and lightweight .NET NoSQL embedded database.
Versions prior to 5.0.13 are subject to Deserialization of Untrusted
Data. LiteDB uses a special field in JSON documents to cast different
types from `BsonDocument` to POCO classes. When instances of an object
are not the same of class, `BsonMapper` use a special field `_type`
string info with full class name with assembly to be loaded and fit
into your model. If your end-user can send to your app a plain JSON
string, deserialization can load an unsafe object to fit into your
model. This issue is patched in version 5.0.13 with some basic fixes
to avoid this, but is not 100% guaranteed when using `Object` type.
The next major version will contain an allow-list to select what kind
of Assembly can be loaded. Workarounds are detailed in the vendor

Cortex provides multi-tenant, long term storage for Prometheus. A
local file inclusion vulnerability exists in Cortex versions 1.13.0,
1.13.1 and 1.14.0, where a malicious actor could remotely read local
files as a result of parsing maliciously crafted Alertmanager
configurations when submitted to the Alertmanager Set Configuration
API. Only users of the Alertmanager service where
`-experimental.alertmanager.enable-api` or `enable_api: true` is
configured are affected. Affected Cortex users are advised to upgrade
to patched versions 1.13.2 or 1.14.1. However as a workaround, Cortex
administrators may reject Alertmanager configurations containing the
`api_key_file` setting in the `opsgenie_configs` section before
sending to the Set Alertmanager Configuration API.

github.com/sylabs/scs-library-client is the Go client for the
Singularity Container Services (SCS) Container Library Service. When
the scs-library-client is used to pull a container image, with
authentication, the HTTP Authorization header sent by the client to
the library service may be incorrectly leaked to an S3 backing storage
provider. This occurs in a specific flow, where the library service
redirects the client to a backing S3 storage server, to perform a
multi-part concurrent download. Depending on site configuration, the
S3 service may be provided by a third party. An attacker with access
to the S3 service may be able to extract user credentials, allowing
them to impersonate the user. The vulnerable multi-part concurrent
download flow, with redirect to S3, is only used when communicating
with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, or third party server
implementing this flow. Interaction with Singularity Enterprise 2.x,
and Singularity Container Services (cloud.sylabs.io), does not trigger
the vulnerable flow. We encourage all users to update. Users who
interact with a Singularity Enterprise 1.x installation, using a 3rd
party S3 storage service, are advised to revoke and recreate their
authentication tokens within Singularity Enterprise. There is no
workaround available at this time.

Versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library could be misconfigured so
that legacy, insecure key types are used for signature verification.
For example, DSA keys could be used with the RS256 algorithm. You are
affected if you are using an algorithm and a key type other than a
combination listed in the GitHub Security Advisory as unaffected. This
issue has been fixed, please update to version 9.0.0. This version
validates for asymmetric key type and algorithm combinations. Please
refer to the above mentioned algorithm / key type combinations for the
valid secure configuration. After updating to version 9.0.0, if you
still intend to continue with signing or verifying tokens using
invalid key type/algorithm value combinations, you&#8217;ll need to set the
`allowInvalidAsymmetricKeyTypes` option to `true` in the `sign()`
and/or `verify()` functions.

In versions `<=8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library, lack of algorithm
definition in the `jwt.verify()` function can lead to signature
validation bypass due to defaulting to the `none` algorithm for
signature verification. Users are affected if you do not specify
algorithms in the `jwt.verify()` function. This issue has been fixed,
please update to version 9.0.0 which removes the default support for
the none algorithm in the `jwt.verify()` method. There will be no
impact, if you update to version 9.0.0 and you don&#8217;t need to allow for

jsonwebtoken is an implementation of JSON Web Tokens. Versions `<=
8.5.1` of `jsonwebtoken` library can be misconfigured so that passing
a poorly implemented key retrieval function referring to the
`secretOrPublicKey` argument from the readme link will result in
incorrect verification of tokens. There is a possibility of using a
different algorithm and key combination in verification, other than
the one that was used to sign the tokens. Specifically, tokens signed
with an asymmetric public key could be verified with a symmetric HS256
algorithm. This can lead to successful validation of forged tokens. If
your application is supporting usage of both symmetric key and
asymmetric key in jwt.verify() implementation with the same key
retrieval function. This issue has been patched, please update to

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
Starting with the 8.1 branch and prior to versions 8.5.16, 9.2.10, and
9.3.4, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability affecting the core
plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was possible because SVG
files weren't properly sanitized and allowed arbitrary JavaScript to
be executed in the context of the currently authorized user of the
Grafana instance. An attacker needs to have the Editor role in order
to change a panel to include either an external URL to a SVG-file
containing JavaScript, or use the `data:` scheme to load an inline
SVG-file containing JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege
escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a
known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin
role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may
upgrade to version 8.5.16, 9.2.10, or 9.3.4 to receive a fix.

authentik is an open-source Identity Provider focused on flexibility
and versatility. Versions prior to 2022.11.4 and 2022.10.4 are
vulnerable to Improper Authentication. Token reuse in invitation URLs
leads to access control bypass via the use of a different enrollment
flow than in the one provided. The vulnerability allows an attacker
that knows different invitation flows names (e.g. `enrollment-
invitation-test` and `enrollment-invitation-admin`) via either
different invite links or via brute forcing to signup via a single
invitation url for any valid invite link received (it can even be a
url for a third flow as long as it's a valid invite) as the token used
in the `Invitations` section of the Admin interface does NOT change
when a different `enrollment flow` is selected via the interface and
it is NOT bound to the selected flow, so it will be valid for any flow
when used. This issue is patched in authentik 2022.11.4,2022.10.4 and
2022.12.0. Only configurations that use invitations and have multiple
enrollment flows with invitation stages that grant different
permissions are affected. The default configuration is not vulnerable,
and neither are configurations with a single enrollment flow. As a
workaround, fixed data can be added to invitations which can be

embedding lookup operations. Both `embedding_size` and `lookup_size`
are products of values provided by the user. Hence, a malicious user

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. In multiple
places, TensorFlow uses `tempfile.mktemp` to create temporary files.
While this is acceptable in testing, in utilities and libraries it is
dangerous as a different process can create the file between the check
for the filename in `mktemp` and the actual creation of the file by a
subsequent operation (a TOC/TOU type of weakness). In several
instances, TensorFlow was supposed to actually create a temporary
directory instead of a file. This logic bug is hidden away by the
`mktemp` function usage. We have patched the issue in several commits,
replacing `mktemp` with the safer `mkstemp`/`mkdtemp` functions,
according to the usage pattern. Users are advised to upgrade as soon
as possible.

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding
a tensor from protobuf, TensorFlow might do a null-dereference if
attributes of some mutable arguments to some operations are missing
from the proto. This is guarded by a `DCHECK`. However, `DCHECK` is a
no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in debug builds.
In the first case execution proceeds to the dereferencing of the null
pointer, whereas in the second case it results in a crash due to the
assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We
will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain
scenarios, TensorFlow can fail to specialize a type during shape
inference. This case is covered by the `DCHECK` function however,
`DCHECK` is a no-op in production builds and an assertion failure in
debug builds. In the first case execution proceeds to the `ValueOrDie`
line. This results in an assertion failure as `ret` contains an error
`Status`, not a value. In the second case we also get a crash due to
the assertion failure. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0.
We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and
TensorFlow 2.6.3, as these are also affected and still in supported
range.

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The
implementation of `AssignOp` can result in copying uninitialized data
to a new tensor. This later results in undefined behavior. The
implementation has a check that the left hand side of the assignment
is initialized (to minimize number of allocations), but does not check
that the right hand side is also initialized. The fix will be included
in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. There is a
typo in TensorFlow's `SpecializeType` which results in heap OOB
read/write. Due to a typo, `arg` is initialized to the `i`th mutable
argument in a loop where the loop index is `j`. Hence it is possible
to assign to `arg` from outside the vector of arguments. Since this is
a mutable proto value, it allows both read and write to outside of
bounds data. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will
also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, and TensorFlow 2.6.3,
as these are also affected and still in supported range.

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. A malicious
user can cause a denial of service by altering a `SavedModel` such
that any binary op would trigger `CHECK` failures. This occurs when
the protobuf part corresponding to the tensor arguments is modified
such that the `dtype` no longer matches the `dtype` expected by the
op. In that case, calling the templated binary operator for the binary
op would receive corrupted data, due to the type confusion involved.
If `Tin` and `Tout` don't match the type of data in `out` and
`input_*` tensors then `flat<*>` would interpret it wrongly. In most
cases, this would be a silent failure, but we have noticed scenarios
where this results in a `CHECK` crash, hence a denial of service. The
fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this
commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1, TensorFlow 2.6.3, and TensorFlow 2.5.3, as

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. When decoding
PNG images TensorFlow can produce a memory leak if the image is
invalid. After calling `png::CommonInitDecode(..., &decode)`, the
`decode` value contains allocated buffers which can only be freed by
calling `png::CommonFreeDecode(&decode)`. However, several error case
in the function implementation invoke the `OP_REQUIRES` macro which
immediately terminates the execution of the function, without allowing
for the memory free to occur. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1,

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain
scenarios, Grappler component of TensorFlow is vulnerable to an
integer overflow during cost estimation for crop and resize. Since the
cropping parameters are user controlled, a malicious person can
trigger undefined behavior. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.7.1,

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. Under certain
scenarios, Grappler component of TensorFlow can trigger a null pointer
dereference. There are 2 places where this can occur, for the same
malicious alteration of a `SavedModel` file (fixing the first one
would trigger the same dereference in the second place). First, during
constant folding, the `GraphDef` might not have the required nodes for
the binary operation. If a node is missing, the correposning
`mul_*child` would be null, and the dereference in the subsequent line
would be incorrect. We have a similar issue during
`IsIdentityConsumingSwitch`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The
`GraphDef` format in TensorFlow does not allow self recursive
functions. The runtime assumes that this invariant is satisfied.
However, a `GraphDef` containing a fragment such as the following can
be consumed when loading a `SavedModel`. This would result in a stack
overflow during execution as resolving each `NodeDef` means resolving
the function itself and its nodes. The fix will be included in
TensorFlow 2.8.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow

Tensorflow is an Open Source Machine Learning Framework. The TFG
dialect of TensorFlow (MLIR) makes several assumptions about the
incoming `GraphDef` before converting it to the MLIR-based dialect. If
an attacker changes the `SavedModel` format on disk to invalidate
these assumptions and the `GraphDef` is then converted to MLIR-based
IR then they can cause a crash in the Python interpreter. Under
certain scenarios, heap OOB read/writes are possible. These issues
have been discovered via fuzzing and it is possible that more
weaknesses exist. We will patch them as they are discovered.

Element Desktop is a Matrix client for desktop platforms with Element
Web at its core. Element Desktop before 1.9.7 is vulnerable to a
remote program execution bug with user interaction. The exploit is
non-trivial and requires clicking on a malicious link, followed by
another button click. To the best of our knowledge, the vulnerability
has never been exploited in the wild. If you are using Element Desktop
< 1.9.7, we recommend upgrading at your earliest convenience. If
successfully exploited, the vulnerability allows an attacker to
specify a file path of a binary on the victim's computer which then
gets executed. Notably, the attacker does *not* have the ability to
specify program arguments. However, in certain unspecified
configurations, the attacker may be able to specify an URI instead of
a file path which then gets handled using standard platform
mechanisms. These may allow exploiting further vulnerabilities in
those mechanisms, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

laminas-form is a package for validating and displaying simple and
complex forms. When rendering validation error messages via the
`formElementErrors()` view helper shipped with laminas-form, many
messages will contain the submitted value. However, in laminas-form
prior to version 3.1.1, the value was not being escaped for HTML
contexts, which could potentially lead to a reflected cross-site
scripting attack. Versions 3.1.1 and above contain a patch to mitigate
the vulnerability. A workaround is available. One may manually place
code at the top of a view script where one calls the
`formElementErrors()` view helper. More information about this
workaround is available on the GitHub Security Advisory.

fleet is an open source device management, built on osquery. Versions
prior to 4.9.1 expose a limited ability to spoof SAML authentication
with missing audience verification. This impacts deployments using
SAML SSO in two specific cases: 1. A malicious or compromised Service
Provider (SP) could reuse the SAML response to log into Fleet as a
user -- only if the user has an account with the same email in Fleet,
_and_ the user signs into the malicious SP via SAML SSO from the same
Identity Provider (IdP) configured with Fleet. 2. A user with an
account in Fleet could reuse a SAML response intended for another SP
to log into Fleet. This is only a concern if the user is blocked from
Fleet in the IdP, but continues to have an account in Fleet. If the
user is blocked from the IdP entirely, this cannot be exploited. Fleet
4.9.1 resolves this issue. Users unable to upgrade should: Reduce the
length of sessions on your IdP to reduce the window for malicious re-
use, Limit the amount of SAML Service Providers/Applications used by
user accounts with access to Fleet, and When removing access to Fleet
in the IdP, delete the Fleet user from Fleet as well.

Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
of reusable PHP components. The Symfony form component provides a CSRF
protection mechanism by using a random token injected in the form and
using the session to store and control the token submitted by the
user. When using the FrameworkBundle, this protection can be enabled
or disabled with the configuration. If the configuration is not
specified, by default, the mechanism is enabled as long as the session
is enabled. In a recent change in the way the configuration is loaded,
the default behavior has been dropped and, as a result, the CSRF
protection is not enabled in form when not explicitly enabled, which
makes the application sensible to CSRF attacks. This issue has been
resolved in the patch versions listed and users are advised to update.
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

x26-Cogs is a repository of cogs made by Twentysix for the Red Discord
bot. Among these cogs is the Defender cog, a tool for Discord server
moderation. A vulnerability in the Defender cog prior to version
1.10.0 allows users with admin privileges to issue commands as other
users who share the same server. If a bot owner shares the same server
as the attacker, it is possible for the attacker to issue bot-owner
restricted commands. The issue has been patched in version 1.10.0. One
may unload the Defender cog as a workaround.

Wire webapp is a web client for the wire messaging protocol. In
versions prior to 2022-01-27-production.0 expired ephemeral messages
were not reliably removed from local chat history of Wire Webapp. In
versions before 2022-01-27-production.0 ephemeral messages and assets
might still be accessible through the local search functionality. Any
attempt to view one of these message in the chat view will then
trigger the deletion. This issue only affects locally stored messages.
On premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to
2022-01-27-production.0, so that their users are no longer affected.
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-
native applications. When a cluster is deleted via Cluster Discovery
Service (CDS) all idle connections established to endpoints in that
cluster are disconnected. A recursion was introduced in the procedure
of disconnecting idle connections that can lead to stack exhaustion
and abnormal process termination when a cluster has a large number of
idle connections. This infinite recursion causes Envoy to crash. Users
are advised to upgrade.

treq is an HTTP library inspired by requests but written on top of
Twisted's Agents. Treq's request methods (`treq.get`, `treq.post`,
etc.) and `treq.client.HTTPClient` constructor accept cookies as a
dictionary. Such cookies are not bound to a single domain, and are
therefore sent to *every* domain ("supercookies"). This can
potentially cause sensitive information to leak upon an HTTP redirect
to a different domain., e.g. should `https://example.com` redirect to
`http://cloudstorageprovider.com` the latter will receive the cookie
`session`. Treq 2021.1.0 and later bind cookies given to request
methods (`treq.request`, `treq.get`, `HTTPClient.request`,
`HTTPClient.get`, etc.) to the origin of the *url* parameter. Users
are advised to upgrade. For users unable to upgrade Instead of passing
a dictionary as the *cookies* argument, pass a
`http.cookiejar.CookieJar` instance with properly domain- and scheme-
scoped cookies in it.

PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library
written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as
SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions up to and including
2.11.1 when in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared
by multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one
of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to be
registered in the hash table multiple times (with different hash keys)
leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list collision which
eventually leading to endless loop. A patch is available in commit
db3235953baa56d2fb0e276ca510fefca751643f which will be included in the
next release. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

wire-server provides back end services for Wire, an open source
messenger. In versions of wire-server prior to the 2022-01-27 release,
it was possible to craft DSA Signatures to bypass SAML SSO and
impersonate any Wire user with SAML credentials. In teams with SAML,
but without SCIM, it was possible to create new accounts with fake
SAML credentials. Under certain conditions that can be established by
an attacker, an upstream library for parsing, rendering, signing, and
validating SAML XML data was accepting public keys as trusted that
were provided by the attacker in the signature. As a consequence, the
attacker could login as any user in any Wire team with SAML SSO
enabled. If SCIM was not enabled, the attacker could also create new
users with new SAML NameIDs. In order to exploit this vulnerability,
the attacker needs to know the SSO login code (distributed to all team
members with SAML credentials and visible in the Team Management app),
the SAML EntityID identifying the IdP (a URL not considered sensitive,
but usually hard to guess, also visible in Team Management), and the
SAML NameID of the user (usually an email address or a nick). The
issue has been fixed in wire-server `2022-01-27` and is already
deployed on all Wire managed services. On premise instances of wire-
server need to be updated to `2022-01-27`, so that their backends are
no longer affected. There are currently no known workarounds. More
detailed information about how to reproduce the vulnerability and
mitigation strategies is available in the GitHub Security Advisory.

OpenMRS is a patient-based medical record system focusing on giving
providers a free customizable electronic medical record system.
Affected versions are subject to arbitrary file exfiltration due to
failure to sanitize request when satisfying GET requests for `/images`
& `/initfilter/scripts`. This can allow an attacker to access any file
on a system running OpenMRS that is accessible to the user id OpenMRS
is running under. Affected implementations should update to the latest
patch version of OpenMRS Core for the minor version they use. These
are: 2.1.5, 2.2.1, 2.3.5, 2.4.5 and 2.5.3. As a general rule, this
vulnerability is already mitigated by Tomcat's URL normalization in
Tomcat 7.0.28+. Users on older versions of Tomcat should consider
upgrading their Tomcat instance as well as their OpenMRS instance.

Twig is an open source template language for PHP. When in a sandbox
mode, the `arrow` parameter of the `sort` filter must be a closure to
avoid attackers being able to run arbitrary PHP functions. In affected
versions this constraint was not properly enforced and could lead to
code injection of arbitrary PHP code. Patched versions now disallow
calling non Closure in the `sort` filter as is the case for some other
filters. Users are advised to upgrade.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. In affected versions
AbstractSxExportURLFactoryActionHandler#processSx does not escape
anything from SSX document references when serializing it on
filesystem, it is possible to for the HTML export process to contain
reference elements containing filesystem syntax like "../", "./". or
"/" in general. The referenced elements are not properly escaped. This
issue has been resolved in version 13.6-rc-1. This issue can be worked
around by limiting or disabling document export.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. In affected versions there is a
cross site scripting (XSS) vector in the `registerinline.vm` template
related to the `xredirect` hidden field. This template is only used in
the following conditions: 1. The wiki must be open to registration for
anyone. 2. The wiki must be closed to view for Guest users or more
specifically the XWiki.Registration page must be forbidden in View for
guest user. A way to obtain the second condition is when
administrators checked the "Prevent unregistered users from viewing
pages, regardless of the page rights" box in the administration
rights. This issue is patched in versions 12.10.11, 14.0-rc-1, 13.4.7,
13.10.3. There are two main ways for protecting against this
vulnerability, the easiest and the best one is by applying a patch in
the `registerinline.vm` template, the patch consists in checking the
value of the xredirect field to ensure it matches: `<input
type="hidden" name="xredirect"
value="$escapetool.xml($!request.xredirect)" />`. If for some reason
it's not possible to patch this file, another workaround is to ensure
"Prevent unregistered users from viewing pages, regardless of the page
rights" is not checked in the rights and apply a better right scheme
using groups and rights on spaces.

Wire-ios is a messaging application using the wire protocol on apple's
ios platform. In versions prior to 3.95 malformed resource identifiers
may render the iOS Wire Client completely unusable by causing it to
repeatedly crash on launch. These malformed resource identifiers can
be generated and sent between Wire users. The root cause lies in
[wireapp/wire-ios-transport](https://github.com/wireapp/wire-ios-
transport), where code responsible for removing sensible tokens before
logging may fail and lead to a crash (Swift exception) of the
application. This causes undesirable behavior, however the (greater)
Wire system is still functional. Users are advised to upgrade as soon
as possible. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

ArchiSteamFarm (ASF) is a C# application with primary purpose of
idling Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug
in ASF code, introduced in version V5.2.2.2, the program didn't
adequately verify effective access of the user sending proxy (i.e.
`[Bots]`) commands. In particular, a proxy-like command sent to bot
`A` targeting bot `B` has incorrectly verified user's access against
bot `A` - instead of bot `B`, to which the command was originally
designated. This in result allowed access to resources beyond those
configured, being a security threat affecting confidentiality of other
bot instances. A successful attack exploiting this bug requires a
significant access granted explicitly by original owner of the ASF
process prior to that, as attacker has to control at least a single
bot in the process to make use of this inadequate access verification
loophole. The issue is patched in ASF V5.2.2.5, V5.2.3.2 and future
versions. Users are advised to update as soon as possible.

OPA is an open source, general-purpose policy engine. Under certain
conditions, pretty-printing an abstract syntax tree (AST) that
contains synthetic nodes could change the logic of some statements by
reordering array literals. Example of policies impacted are those that
parse and compare web paths. **All of these** three conditions have to
be met to create an adverse effect: 1. An AST of Rego had to be
**created programmatically** such that it ends up containing terms
without a location (such as wildcard variables). 2. The AST had to be
**pretty-printed** using the `github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/format`
package. 3. The result of the pretty-printing had to be **parsed and
evaluated again** via an OPA instance using the bundles, or the Golang
packages. If any of these three conditions are not met, you are not
affected. Notably, all three would be true if using **optimized
bundles**, i.e. bundles created with `opa build -O=1` or higher. In
that case, the optimizer would fulfil condition (1.), the result of
that would be pretty-printed when writing the bundle to disk,
fulfilling (2.). When the bundle was then used, we'd satisfy (3.). As
a workaround users may disable optimization when creating bundles.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support
for multi-language development. In some cases, Gradle may skip that
verification and accept a dependency that would otherwise fail the
build as an untrusted external artifact. This occurs when dependency
verification is disabled on one or more configurations and those
configurations have common dependencies with other configurations that
have dependency verification enabled. If the configuration that has
dependency verification disabled is resolved first, Gradle does not
verify the common dependencies for the configuration that has
dependency verification enabled. Gradle 7.4 fixes that issue by
validating artifacts at least once if they are present in a resolved
configuration that has dependency verification active. For users who
cannot update either do not use
`ResolutionStrategy.disableDependencyVerification()` and do not use
plugins that use that method to disable dependency verification for a
single configuration or make sure resolution of configuration that
disable that feature do not happen in builds that resolve
configuration where the feature is enabled.

Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version
2.6.1, Traefik skips the router transport layer security (TLS)
configuration when the host header is a fully qualified domain name
(FQDN). For a request, the TLS configuration choice can be different
than the router choice, which implies the use of a wrong TLS
configuration. When sending a request using FQDN handled by a router
configured with a dedicated TLS configuration, the TLS configuration
falls back to the default configuration that might not correspond to
the configured one. If the CNAME flattening is enabled, the selected
TLS configuration is the SNI one and the routing uses the CNAME value,
so this can skip the expected TLS configuration. Version 2.6.1
contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, one may add the FDQN
to the host rule. However, there is no workaround if the CNAME
flattening is enabled.

Action Pack is a framework for handling and responding to web
requests. Under certain circumstances response bodies will not be
closed. In the event a response is *not* notified of a `close`,
`ActionDispatch::Executor` will not know to reset thread local state
for the next request. This can lead to data being leaked to subsequent
requests.This has been fixed in Rails 7.0.2.1, 6.1.4.5, 6.0.4.5, and
5.2.6.1. Upgrading is highly recommended, but to work around this

Puma is a Ruby/Rack web server built for parallelism. Prior to `puma`
version `5.6.2`, `puma` may not always call `close` on the response
body. Rails, prior to version `7.0.2.2`, depended on the response body
being closed in order for its `CurrentAttributes` implementation to
work correctly. The combination of these two behaviors (Puma not
closing the body + Rails' Executor implementation) causes information
leakage. This problem is fixed in Puma versions 5.6.2 and 4.3.11. This
problem is fixed in Rails versions 7.02.2, 6.1.4.6, 6.0.4.6, and
5.2.6.2. Upgrading to a patched Rails _or_ Puma version fixes the
vulnerability.

Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure
microservices. In affected versions the Istio control plane, `istiod`,
is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious
attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the
control plane crashing. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15012,
but does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple
installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the
cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments,
especially [multicluster](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/m
ulticluster/primary-remote/) topologies, this port is exposed over the
public internet. There are no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading.
Limiting network access to Istiod to the minimal set of clients can
help lessen the scope of the vulnerability to some extent.

Wasmtime is an open source runtime for WebAssembly & WASI. Prior to
versions 0.34.1 and 0.33.1, there exists a bug in the pooling instance
allocator in Wasmtime's runtime where a failure to instantiate an
instance for a module that defines an `externref` global will result
in an invalid drop of a `VMExternRef` via an uninitialized pointer. A
number of conditions listed in the GitHub Security Advisory must be
true in order for an instance to be vulnerable to this issue.
Maintainers believe that the effective impact of this bug is
relatively small because the usage of `externref` is still uncommon
and without a resource limiter configured on the `Store`, which is not
the default configuration, it is only possible to trigger the bug from
an error returned by `mprotect` or `VirtualAlloc`. Note that on Linux
with the `uffd` feature enabled, it is only possible to trigger the
bug from a resource limiter as the call to `mprotect` is skipped. The
bug has been fixed in 0.34.1 and 0.33.1 and users are encouraged to
upgrade as soon as possible. If it is not possible to upgrade to
version 0.34.1 or 0.33.1 of the `wasmtime` crate, it is recommend that
support for the reference types proposal be disabled by passing
`false` to `Config::wasm_reference_types`. Doing so will prevent
modules that use `externref` from being loaded entirely.

crossbeam-utils provides atomics, synchronization primitives, scoped
threads, and other utilities for concurrent programming in Rust.
crossbeam-utils prior to version 0.8.7 incorrectly assumed that the
alignment of `{i,u}64` was always the same as `Atomic{I,U}64`.
However, the alignment of `{i,u}64` on a 32-bit target can be smaller
than `Atomic{I,U}64`. This can cause unaligned memory accesses and
data race. Crates using `fetch_*` methods with `AtomicCell<{i,u}64>`
are affected by this issue. 32-bit targets without `Atomic{I,U}64` and
64-bit targets are not affected by this issue. This has been fixed in
crossbeam-utils 0.8.7. There are currently no known workarounds.

Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph prior
to version 3.37 is vulnerable to remote code execution in the
`gitserver` service. The service acts as a git exec proxy, and fails
to properly restrict calling `git config`. This allows an attacker to
set the git `core.sshCommand` option, which sets git to use the
specified command instead of ssh when they need to connect to a remote
system. Exploitation of this vulnerability depends on how Sourcegraph
is deployed. An attacker able to make HTTP requests to internal
services like gitserver is able to exploit it. This issue is patched
in Sourcegraph version 3.37. As a workaround, ensure that requests to
gitserver are properly protected.

Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph
versions 3.35 and 3.36 reintroduced a previously fixed side-channel
vulnerabilitity in the Code Monitoring feature where strings in
private source code could be guessed by an authenticated but
unauthorized actor. This issue affects only the Code Monitoring
feature, whereas CVE-2021-43823 also affected saved searches. A
successful attack would require an authenticated bad actor to create
many Code Monitors to receive confirmation that a specific string
exists. This could allow an attacker to guess formatted tokens in
source code, such as API keys. This issue was patched in versions
3.35.2 and 3.36.3 of Sourcegraph. Those who are unable to upgrade may
disable the Code Monitor feature in their installation.

swtpm is a libtpms-based TPM emulator with socket, character device,
and Linux CUSE interface. Versions prior to 0.5.3, 0.6.2, and 0.7.1
are vulnerable to out-of-bounds read. A specially crafted header of
swtpm's state, where the blobheader's hdrsize indicator has an invalid
value, may cause an out-of-bounds access when the byte array
representing the state of the TPM is accessed. This will likely crash
swtpm or prevent it from starting since the state cannot be
understood. Users should upgrade to swtpm v0.5.3, v0.6.2, or v0.7.1 to
receive a patch. There are currently no known workarounds.

Cosign provides container signing, verification, and storage in an OCI
registry for the sigstore project. Prior to version 1.5.2, Cosign can
be manipulated to claim that an entry for a signature exists in the
Rekor transparency log even if it doesn't. This requires the attacker
to have pull and push permissions for the signature in OCI. This can
happen with both standard signing with a keypair and "keyless signing"
with Fulcio. If an attacker has access to the signature in OCI, they
can manipulate cosign into believing the entry was stored in Rekor
even though it wasn't. The vulnerability has been patched in v1.5.2 of
Cosign. The `signature` in the `signedEntryTimestamp` provided by
Rekor is now compared to the `signature` that is being verified. If
these don't match, then an error is returned. If a valid bundle is
copied to a different signature, verification should fail. Cosign
output now only informs the user that certificates were verified if a
certificate was in fact verified. There is currently no known
workaround.

b2-sdk-python is a python library to access cloud storage provided by
backblaze. Linux and Mac releases of the SDK version 1.14.0 and below
contain a key disclosure vulnerability that, in certain conditions,
can be exploited by local attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-
use (TOCTOU) race condition. SDK users of the SqliteAccountInfo format
are vulnerable while users of the InMemoryAccountInfo format are safe.
The SqliteAccountInfo saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping)
in a local database file ($XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info,
~/.b2_account_info or a user-defined path). When first created, the
file is world readable and is (typically a few milliseconds) later
altered to be private to the user. If the directory containing the
file is readable by a local attacker then during the brief period
between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker
can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the
local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive
information has been saved to it. Consumers of this SDK who rely on it
to save data using SqliteAccountInfo class should upgrade to the
latest version of the SDK. Those who believe a local user might have
opened a handle using this race condition, should remove the affected
database files and regenerate all application keys. Users should
upgrade to b2-sdk-python 1.14.1 or later.

capsule-proxy is a reverse proxy for Capsule Operator which provides
multi-tenancy in Kubernetes. In versions prior to 0.2.1 an attacker
with a proper authentication mechanism may use a malicious
`Connection` header to start a privilege escalation attack towards the
Kubernetes API Server. This vulnerability allows for an exploit of the
`cluster-admin` Role bound to `capsule-proxy`. There are no known
workarounds for this issue.

B2 Command Line Tool is the official command line tool for the
backblaze cloud storage service. Linux and Mac releases of the B2
command-line tool version 3.2.0 and below contain a key disclosure
vulnerability that, in certain conditions, can be exploited by local
attackers through a time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition.
The command line tool saves API keys (and bucket name-to-id mapping)
in a local database file (`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/b2/account_info`,
`~/.b2_account_info` or a user-defined path) when `b2 authorize-
account` is first run. This happens regardless of whether a valid key
is provided or not. When first created, the file is world readable and
is (typically a few milliseconds) later altered to be private to the
user. If the directory is readable by a local attacker and the user
did not yet run `b2 authorize-account` then during the brief period
between file creation and permission modification, a local attacker
can race to open the file and maintain a handle to it. This allows the
local attacker to read the contents after the file after the sensitive
information has been saved to it. Users that have not yet run `b2
authorize-account` should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1
before running it. Users that have run `b2 authorize-account` are safe
if at the time of the file creation no other local users had read
access to the local configuration file. Users that have run `b2
authorize-account` where the designated path could be opened by
another local user should upgrade to B2 Command-Line Tool v3.2.1 and
remove the database and regenerate all application keys. Note that `b2
clear-account` does not remove the database file and it should not be
used to ensure that all open handles to the file are invalidated. If
B2 Command-Line Tool cannot be upgraded to v3.2.1 due to a dependency
conflict, a binary release can be used instead. Alternatively a new
version could be installed within a virtualenv, or the permissions can
be changed to prevent local users from opening the database file.

Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. In affected versions an
authenticated user with write access on a restricted set of paths can
update a page outside the allowed paths by specifying a different
target page ID while keeping the path intact. The access control
incorrectly check the path access against the user-provided values
instead of the actual path associated to the page ID. Commit https://g
ithub.com/Requarks/wiki/commit/411802ec2f654bb5ed1126c307575b81e2361c6
b fixes this vulnerability by checking access control on the path
associated with the page ID instead of the user-provided value. When
the path is different than the current value, a second access control
check is then performed on the user-provided path before the move
operation.

Octobercms is a self-hosted CMS platform based on the Laravel PHP
Framework. Affected versions of OctoberCMS did not validate gateway
server signatures. As a result non-authoritative gateway servers may
be used to exfiltrate user private keys. Users are advised to upgrade
their installations to build 474 or v1.1.10. The only known workaround
is to manually apply the patch
(e3b455ad587282f0fbcb7763c6d9c3d000ca1e6a) which adds server signature
validation.

Zulip is an open source team chat app. The `main` development branch
of Zulip Server from June 2021 and later is vulnerable to a cross-site
scripting vulnerability on the recent topics page. An attacker could
maliciously craft a full name for their account and send messages to a
topic with several participants; a victim who then opens an overflow
tooltip including this full name on the recent topics page could
trigger execution of JavaScript code controlled by the attacker. Users
running a Zulip server from the main branch should upgrade from main
(2022-03-01 or later) again to deploy this fix.

Xerox VersaLink devices on specific versions of firmware before
2022-01-26 allow remote attackers to brick the device via a crafted
TIFF file in an unauthenticated HTTP POST request. There is a
permanent denial of service because image parsing causes a reboot, but
image parsing is restarted as soon as the boot process finishes.
However, this boot loop can be resolved by a field technician. The
TIFF file must have an incomplete Image Directory. Affected firmware
versions include xx.42.01 and xx.50.61. NOTE: the 2022-01-24 NeoSmart
article included "believed to affect all previous and later versions
as of the date of this posting" but a 2022-01-26 vendor statement

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/11/3

An attacker can abuse the batch-requests plugin to send requests to
bypass the IP restriction of Admin API. A default configuration of
Apache APISIX (with default API key) is vulnerable to remote code
execution. When the admin key was changed or the port of Admin API was
changed to a port different from the data panel, the impact is lower.
But there is still a risk to bypass the IP restriction of Apache
APISIX's data panel. There is a check in the batch-requests plugin
which overrides the client IP with its real remote IP. But due to a
bug in the code, this check can be bypassed.

A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability was discovered in
ProjectGeneral/edit_project_settings.php in REDCap 12.0.11. This issue
allows any user with project management permissions to inject
arbitrary code into the project title (app_title) field when editing
an existing project. The payload is then reflected within the title
tag of the page.

Timescale TimescaleDB 1.x and 2.x before 2.5.2 may allow privilege
escalation during extension installation. The installation process
uses commands such as CREATE x IF NOT EXIST that allow an unprivileged
user to precreate objects. These objects will be used by the installer
(which executes as Superuser), leading to privilege escalation. In
order to be able to take advantage of this, an unprivileged user would
need to be able to create objects in a database and then get a
Superuser to install TimescaleDB into their database. (In the fixed
versions, the installation aborts when it finds that an object already
exists.)

In IOBit Advanced System Care (AscService.exe) 15, an attacker with
SEImpersonatePrivilege can create a named pipe with the same name as
one of ASCService's named pipes. ASCService first tries to connect
before trying to create the named pipes, because of that during login
the service will try to connect to the attacker which will lead to
either escalation of privileges (through token manipulation and
ImpersonateNamedPipeClient() ) from ADMIN -> SYSTEM or from Local
ADMIN-> Domain ADMIN depending on the user and named pipe that is
used.

Reference: MISC:https://www.scrawledsecurityblog.com/2022/11/automating-unsolicited-richard-pics.html

The user_id and device_id on the Ourphoto App version 1.4.1 /device/*
end-points both suffer from insecure direct object reference
vulnerabilities. Other end-users user_id and device_id values can be
enumerated by incrementing or decrementing id numbers. The impact of
this vulnerability allows an attacker to discover sensitive
information such as end-user email addresses, and their unique
frame_token value of all other Ourphoto App end-users.

======================================================
Name: CVE-2022-24188
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.scrawledsecurityblog.com/2022/11/automating-unsolicited-richard-pics.html

The /device/signin end-point for the Ourphoto App version 1.4.1
discloses clear-text password information for functionality within the
picture frame devices. The deviceVideoCallPassword and mqttPassword
are returned in clear-text. The lack of sessions management and
presence of insecure direct object references allows to return
password information for other end-users devices. Many of the picture
frame devices offer video calling, and it is likely this information
can be used to abuse that functionality.

======================================================

The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary
file deletion in versions up to, and including 3.2.50. This is due to
insufficient file type and path validation on the deleteFiles()
function found in the ~/Admin/Menu/Packages.php file that triggers
upon download post deletion. This makes it possible for contributor
level users and above to supply an arbitrary file path via the
'file[files]' parameter when creating a download post and once the
user deletes the post the supplied arbitrary file will be deleted.
This can be used by attackers to delete the /wp-config.php file which
will reset the installation and make it possible for an attacker to
achieve remote code execution on the server.

An authenticated user can create a link with reflected XSS payload for
actions&#8217; pages, and send it to other users. Malicious code has access
to all the same objects as the rest of the web page and can make
arbitrary modifications to the contents of the page being displayed to
a victim. This attack can be implemented with the help of social
engineering and expiration of a number of factors - an attacker should
have authorized access to the Zabbix Frontend and allowed network
connection between a malicious server and victim&#8217;s computer,
understand attacked infrastructure, be recognized by the victim as a
trustee and use trusted communication channel.

The package snyk before 1.1064.0 are vulnerable to Code Injection when
analyzing a project. An attacker who can convince a user to scan a
malicious project can include commands in a build file such as
build.gradle or gradle-wrapper.jar, which will be executed with the
privileges of the application. This vulnerability may be triggered
when running the the CLI tool directly, or when running a scan with
one of the IDE plugins that invoke the Snyk CLI. Successful
exploitation of this issue would likely require some level of social
engineering - to coerce an untrusted project to be downloaded and
analyzed via the Snyk CLI or opened in an IDE where a Snyk IDE plugin
is installed and enabled. Additionally, if the IDE has a Trust feature
then the target folder must be marked as &#8216;trusted&#8217; in order to be
vulnerable. **NOTE:** This issue is independent of the one reported in
[CVE-2022-40764](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SNYK-3037342),
and upgrading to a fixed version for this addresses that issue as
well. The affected IDE plugins and versions are: - VS Code - Affected:

XML external entity injection(XXE) is a vulnerability that allows an
attacker to interfere with an application's processing of XML data.
This attack occurs when XML input containing a reference to an
external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser. The
software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with
URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of
control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its
output. Here, XML external entity injection lead to External Service
interaction & Internal file read in Business Central and also Kie-
Server APIs.

A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service
attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HTTP/2
frame. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to
1.19.1. This vulnerability is caused by a logical error when parsing a
HTTP/2 HEADERS frame where the frame contains priority information
without any other data. This logical error caused confusion about the
size of the frame, leading to a parsing error. This parsing error
immediately crashes the entire process. Sending a HEADERS frame with
HTTP/2 priority information does not require any special permission,
so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For clients, this
means any server to which they connect may launch this attack. For
servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch such an
attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little resources to
send an appropriately crafted frame. The impact on availability is
high: receiving the frame immediately crashes the server, dropping all
in-flight connections and causing the service to need to restart. It
is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send appropriately
crafted frames, so attackers require very few resources to achieve a
substantial denial of service. The attack does not have any
confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2
is parsing the frame in memory-safe code, so the crash is safe.
However, sudden process crashes can lead to violations of invariants
in services, so it is possible that this attack can be used to trigger
an error condition that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The
risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from
communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to
many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to
correctly handle the condition. The issue was found by automated
fuzzing by oss-fuzz.

A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service
attack, caused by a network peer sending a specially crafted HPACK-
encoded header block. This attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions
from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. There are a number of implementation errors in
the parsing of HPACK-encoded header blocks that allow maliciously
crafted HPACK header blocks to cause crashes in processes using swift-
nio-http2. Each of these crashes is triggered instead of an integer
overflow. A malicious HPACK header block could be sent on any of the
HPACK-carrying frames in a HTTP/2 connection (HEADERS and
PUSH_PROMISE), at any position. Sending a HPACK header block does not
require any special permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send
one. For clients, this means any server to which they connect may
launch this attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them
may launch such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very
little resources to send an appropriately crafted field block. The
impact on availability is high: receiving a frame carrying this field
block immediately crashes the server, dropping all in-flight
connections and causing the service to need to restart. It is
straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send appropriately
crafted field blocks, so attackers require very few resources to
achieve a substantial denial of service. The attack does not have any
confidentiality or integrity risks in and of itself: swift-nio-http2
is parsing the field block in memory-safe code and the crash is
triggered instead of an integer overflow. However, sudden process
crashes can lead to violations of invariants in services, so it is
possible that this attack can be used to trigger an error condition
that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The risk can be mitigated
if untrusted peers can be prevented from communicating with the
service. This mitigation is not available to many services. The issue
is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to correctly handle all
conditions in the function. The principal issue was found by automated
fuzzing by oss-fuzz, but several associated bugs in the same code were
found by code audit and fixed at the same time

A program using swift-nio-http2 is vulnerable to a denial of service
attack caused by a network peer sending ALTSVC or ORIGIN frames. This
attack affects all swift-nio-http2 versions from 1.0.0 to 1.19.1. This
vulnerability is caused by a logical error after frame parsing but
before frame handling. ORIGIN and ALTSVC frames are not currently
supported by swift-nio-http2, and should be ignored. However, one code
path that encounters them has a deliberate trap instead. This was left
behind from the original development process and was never removed.
Sending an ALTSVC or ORIGIN frame does not require any special
permission, so any HTTP/2 connection peer may send such a frame. For
clients, this means any server to which they connect may launch this
attack. For servers, anyone they allow to connect to them may launch
such an attack. The attack is low-effort: it takes very little
resources to send one of these frames. The impact on availability is
high: receiving the frame immediately crashes the server, dropping all
in-flight connections and causing the service to need to restart. It
is straightforward for an attacker to repeatedly send these frames, so
attackers require very few resources to achieve a substantial denial
of service. The attack does not have any confidentiality or integrity
risks in and of itself. This is a controlled, intentional crash.
However, sudden process crashes can lead to violations of invariants
in services, so it is possible that this attack can be used to trigger
an error condition that has confidentiality or integrity risks. The
risk can be mitigated if untrusted peers can be prevented from
communicating with the service. This mitigation is not available to
many services. The issue is fixed by rewriting the parsing code to
correctly handle the condition. The issue was found by automated

need to code as these after upgrading to v4.1.9. Otherwise, the CSRF
protection may be bypassed. If auto-routing is enabled, check the
request method in the controller method before processing. If auto-
routing is disabled, either avoid using `$routes->add()` and instead
use HTTP verbs in routes; or check the request method in the
controller method before processing.

regex is an implementation of regular expressions for the Rust
language. The regex crate features built-in mitigations to prevent
denial of service attacks caused by untrusted regexes, or untrusted
input matched by trusted regexes. Those (tunable) mitigations already
provide sane defaults to prevent attacks. This guarantee is documented
and it's considered part of the crate's API. Unfortunately a bug was
discovered in the mitigations designed to prevent untrusted regexes to
take an arbitrary amount of time during parsing, and it's possible to
craft regexes that bypass such mitigations. This makes it possible to
perform denial of service attacks by sending specially crafted regexes
to services accepting user-controlled, untrusted regexes. All versions
of the regex crate before or equal to 1.5.4 are affected by this
issue. The fix is include starting from regex 1.5.5. All users
accepting user-controlled regexes are recommended to upgrade
immediately to the latest version of the regex crate. Unfortunately
there is no fixed set of problematic regexes, as there are practically
infinite regexes that could be crafted to exploit this vulnerability.
Because of this, it us not recommend to deny known problematic
regexes.

Fluture-Node is a FP-style HTTP and streaming utils for Node based on
Fluture. Using `followRedirects` or `followRedirectsWith` with any of
the redirection strategies built into fluture-node 4.0.0 or 4.0.1,
paired with a request that includes confidential headers such as
Authorization or Cookie, exposes you to a vulnerability where, if the
destination server were to redirect the request to a server on a
third-party domain, or the same domain over unencrypted HTTP, the
headers would be included in the follow-up request and be exposed to
the third party, or potential http traffic sniffing. The redirection
strategies made available in version 4.0.2 automatically redact
confidential headers when a redirect is followed across to another
origin. A workaround has been identified by using a custom redirection
strategy via the `followRedirectsWith` function. The custom strategy
can be based on the new strategies available in fluture-node@4.0.2.

image_processing is an image processing wrapper for libvips and
ImageMagick/GraphicsMagick. Prior to version 1.12.2, using the
`#apply` method from image_processing to apply a series of operations
that are coming from unsanitized user input allows the attacker to
execute shell commands. This method is called internally by Active
Storage variants, so Active Storage is vulnerable as well. The
vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.12.2 of image_processing. As
a workaround, users who process based on user input should always
sanitize the user input by allowing only a constrained set of
operations.

CometD is a scalable comet implementation for web messaging. In any
version prior to 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6, internal usage of Oort and
Seti channels is improperly authorized, so any remote user could
subscribe and publish to those channels. By subscribing to those
channels, a remote user may be able to watch cluster-internal traffic
that contains other users' (possibly sensitive) data. By publishing to
those channels, a remote user may be able to create/modify/delete
other user's data and modify the cluster structure. A fix is available
in versions 5.0.11, 6.0.6, and 7.0.6. As a workaround, install a
custom `SecurityPolicy` that forbids subscription and publishing to
remote, non-Oort, sessions on Oort and Seti channels.

cmark-gfm is GitHub's extended version of the C reference
implementation of CommonMark. Prior to versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and
0.28.3.gfm.21, an integer overflow in cmark-gfm's table row parsing
`table.c:row_from_string` may lead to heap memory corruption when
parsing tables who's marker rows contain more than UINT16_MAX columns.
The impact of this heap corruption ranges from Information Leak to
Arbitrary Code Execution depending on how and where `cmark-gfm` is
used. If `cmark-gfm` is used for rendering remote user controlled
markdown, this vulnerability may lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
in applications employing affected versions of the `cmark-gfm`
library. This vulnerability has been patched in the following cmark-
gfm versions 0.29.0.gfm.3 and 0.28.3.gfm.21. A workaround is
available. The vulnerability exists in the table markdown extensions
of cmark-gfm. Disabling the table extension will prevent this
vulnerability from being triggered.

patched in version 1.5.1. As a workaround, manually escape all
instances of the tilde character (`~`) using `arg.replace(/~/g,

Istio is an open platform to connect, manage, and secure
microservices. In affected versions the Istio control plane, istiod,
is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a malicious
attacker that sends a specially crafted message which results in the
control plane crashing when the validating webhook for a cluster is
exposed publicly. This endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but
does not require any authentication from the attacker. For simple
installations, Istiod is typically only reachable from within the
cluster, limiting the blast radius. However, for some deployments,
especially [external
istiod](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/install/external-
controlplane/) topologies, this port is exposed over the public
internet. This issue has been patched in versions 1.13.2, 1.12.5 and
1.11.8. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should
disable access to a validating webhook that is exposed to the public
internet or restrict the set of IP addresses that can query it to a
set of known, trusted entities.

The WP-UserOnline plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-
Site Scripting via the &#8216;templates[browsingpage][text]' parameter in
versions up to, and including, 2.87.6 due to insufficient input
sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers with administrative capabilities and above to
inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a
user accesses an injected page. The only affects multi-site

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 1.3.0 but before versions
2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal bug,
compounded by an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious
user with read-only repository access to leak sensitive files from
Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user who has been granted
`get` access for a repository containing a Helm chart can craft an API
request to the `/api/v1/repositories/{repo_url}/appdetails` endpoint
to leak the contents of out-of-bounds files from the repo-server. The
malicious payload would reference an out-of-bounds file, and the
contents of that file would be returned as part of the response.
Contents from a non-YAML file may be returned as part of an error
message. The attacker would have to know or guess the location of the
target file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include files from
other Applications' source repositories or any secrets which have been
mounted as files on the repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in
Argo CD versions 2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The patches prevent path
traversal and limit access to users who either A) have been granted
Application `create` privileges or B) have been granted Application
`get` privileges and are requesting details for a `repo_url` that has
already been used for the given Application. There are currently no
known workarounds.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 1.5.0 but before versions
2.1.11, 2.2.6, and 2.3.0 is vulnerable to a path traversal
vulnerability, allowing a malicious user with read/write access to
leak sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD
user who has been granted `create` or `update` access to Applications
can leak the contents of any text file on the repo-server. By crafting
a malicious Helm chart and using it in an Application, the attacker
can retrieve the sensitive file's contents either as part of the
generated manifests or in an error message. The attacker would have to
know or guess the location of the target file. Sensitive files which
could be leaked include files from another Application's source
repositories or any secrets which have been mounted as files on the
repo-server. This vulnerability is patched in Argo CD versions 2.1.11,
2.2.6, and 2.3.0. The problem can be mitigated by avoiding storing
secrets in git, avoiding mounting secrets as files on the repo-server,
avoiding decrypting secrets into files on the repo-server, and
carefully limiting who can `create` or `update` Applications.

Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.9.10,
1.10.11, and 1.11.2, it is possible for a page controlled by an
attacker to load the website within an iframe. This will enable a

application's interface with a different interface provided by the
attacker. The issue is fixed in versions 1.9.10, 1.10.11, and 1.11.2.
A workaround is available. Every response from app should have an
X-Frame-Options header set to: ``sameorigin``. To achieve that, add a
new `subscriber` in the app.

MyBB is a free and open source forum software. In affected versions
the Admin CP's Settings management module does not validate setting
types correctly on insertion and update, making it possible to add
settings of supported type `php` with PHP code, executed on on _Change
Settings_ pages. This results in a Remote Code Execution (RCE)
vulnerability. The vulnerable module requires Admin CP access with the
`Can manage settings?` permission. MyBB's Settings module, which
allows administrators to add, edit, and delete non-default settings,
stores setting data in an options code string ($options_code;
mybb_settings.optionscode database column) that identifies the setting
type and its options, separated by a new line character (\n). In MyBB
1.2.0, support for setting type php was added, for which the remaining
part of the options code is PHP code executed on Change Settings pages
(reserved for plugins and internal use). MyBB 1.8.30 resolves this
issue. There are no known workarounds.

Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. By exploiting
weaknesses in the Lua script execution environment, an attacker with
access to Redis prior to version 7.0.0 or 6.2.7 can inject Lua code
that will execute with the (potentially higher) privileges of another
Redis user. The Lua script execution environment in Redis provides
some measures that prevent a script from creating side effects that
persist and can affect the execution of the same, or different script,
at a later time. Several weaknesses of these measures have been
publicly known for a long time, but they had no security impact as the
Redis security model did not endorse the concept of users or
privileges. With the introduction of ACLs in Redis 6.0, these
weaknesses can be exploited by a less privileged users to inject Lua
code that will execute at a later time, when a privileged user
executes a Lua script. The problem is fixed in Redis versions 7.0.0
and 6.2.7. An additional workaround to mitigate this problem without
patching the redis-server executable, if Lua scripting is not being
used, is to block access to `SCRIPT LOAD` and `EVAL` commands using
ACL rules.

alltube is an html front end for youtube-dl. On releases prior to
3.0.3, an attacker could craft a special HTML page to trigger either
an open redirect attack or a Server-Side Request Forgery attack
(depending on how AllTube is configured). The impact is mitigated by
the fact the SSRF attack is only possible when the `stream` option is
enabled in the configuration. (This option is disabled by default.)

Sylius is an open source eCommerce platform. Prior to versions 1.10.11
and 1.11.2, the reset password token was not set to null after the
password was changed. The same token could be used several times,
which could result in leak of the existing token and unauthorized
password change. The issue is fixed in versions 1.10.11 and 1.11.2. As
a workaround, overwrite the
`Sylius\Bundle\ApiBundle\CommandHandler\ResetPasswordHandler` class

Bareos is open source software for backup, archiving, and recovery of
data for operating systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 >= 18.2 but
prior to 21.1.0, 20.0.6, and 19.2.12 is built and configured for PAM
authentication, it will skip authorization checks completely. Expired
accounts and accounts with expired passwords can still login. This
problem will affect users that have PAM enabled. Currently there is no
authorization (e.g. check for expired or disabled accounts), but only
plain authentication (i.e. check if username and password match).
Bareos Director versions 21.1.0, 20.0.6 and 19.2.12 implement the
authorization check that was previously missing. The only workaround
is to make sure that authentication fails if the user is not
authorized.

data for operating systems. When Bareos Director >= 18.2 but prior to
21.1.0, 20.0.6, and 19.2.12 is built and configured for PAM

Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions
prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability
in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the
default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to
RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file
`DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any
other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed
on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as
possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your
installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00011.html

Waitress is a Web Server Gateway Interface server for Python 2 and 3.
When using Waitress versions 2.1.0 and prior behind a proxy that does
not properly validate the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230
standard, Waitress and the frontend proxy may disagree on where one
request starts and where it ends. This would allow requests to be
smuggled via the front-end proxy to waitress and later behavior. There
are two classes of vulnerability that may lead to request smuggling
that are addressed by this advisory: The use of Python's `int()` to
parse strings into integers, leading to `+10` to be parsed as `10`, or
`0x01` to be parsed as `1`, where as the standard specifies that the
string should contain only digits or hex digits; and Waitress does not
support chunk extensions, however it was discarding them without
validating that they did not contain illegal characters. This
vulnerability has been patched in Waitress 2.1.1. A workaround is
available. When deploying a proxy in front of waitress, turning on any
and all functionality to make sure that the request matches the
RFC7230 standard. Certain proxy servers may not have this
functionality though and users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest
version of waitress instead.

sysend.js is a library that allows a user to send messages between
pages that are open in the same browser. Users that use cross-origin
communication may have their communications intercepted. Impact is
limited by the communication occurring in the same browser. This issue
has been patched in sysend.js version 1.10.0. The only currently known
workaround is to avoid sending communications that a user does not
want to have intercepted via sysend messages.

Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches.
This vulnerability affects users working on multi-user machines, where
untrusted parties have write access to the same hard disk. Those
untrusted parties could create the folder `C:\.git`, which would be
picked up by Git operations run supposedly outside a repository while
searching for a Git directory. Git would then respect any config in
said Git directory. Git Bash users who set `GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE`
are vulnerable as well. Users who installed posh-gitare vulnerable
simply by starting a PowerShell. Users of IDEs such as Visual Studio
are vulnerable: simply creating a new project would already read and
respect the config specified in `C:\.git\config`. Users of the
Microsoft fork of Git are vulnerable simply by starting a Git Bash.
The problem has been patched in Git for Windows v2.35.2. Users unable
to upgrade may create the folder `.git` on all drives where Git
commands are run, and remove read/write access from those folders as a
workaround. Alternatively, define or extend `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`
to cover the _parent_ directory of the user profile, e.g. `C:\Users`
if the user profile is located in `C:\Users\my-user-name`.

mitmproxy is an interactive, SSL/TLS-capable intercepting proxy. In
mitmproxy 7.0.4 and below, a malicious client or server is able to
perform HTTP request smuggling attacks through mitmproxy. This means
that a malicious client/server could smuggle a request/response
through mitmproxy as part of another request/response's HTTP message
body. While mitmproxy would only see one request, the target server
would see multiple requests. A smuggled request is still captured as
part of another request's body, but it does not appear in the request
list and does not go through the usual mitmproxy event hooks, where
users may have implemented custom access control checks or input
sanitization. Unless mitmproxy is used to protect an HTTP/1 service,
no action is required. The vulnerability has been fixed in mitmproxy
8.0.0 and above. There are currently no known workarounds.

Git for Windows is a fork of Git containing Windows-specific patches.
Since part of Git for Windows' uninstaller is copied into the current
user's temporary directory and run in that place, it is important to
ensure that there are no malicious `.dll` file in that directory that
might be loaded as part of loading the executable. However, the
default system settings for `TMP` and `TEMP` are to point to
`C:\Windows\Temp`, a folder that is world-writable (for historical
reasons), and the SYSTEM user account inherits those settings. This
means that any authenticated user can place malicious `.dll` files
that are loaded when Git for Windows' uninstaller is run via the
SYSTEM account. Fixes are available in Git for Windows v2.35.2 or
newer. Users unable to upgrade may override SYSTEM's `TMP` environment
variable to point to a directory exclusively under SYSTEM's control
before running the uninstaller, clear `C:\Windows\Temp` of all `.dll`
files before running the uninstaller, or run the uninstaller under an
admin account rather than SYSTEM as a workaround.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. All unpatched versions of Argo CD starting with 1.0.0 are
vulnerable to an improper access control bug, allowing a malicious
user to potentially escalate their privileges to admin-level. Versions
starting with 0.8.0 and 0.5.0 contain limited versions of this issue.
To perform exploits, an authorized Argo CD user must have push access
to an Application's source git or Helm repository or `sync` and
`override` access to an Application. Once a user has that access,
different exploitation levels are possible depending on their other
RBAC privileges. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in
Argo CD versions 2.3.2, 2.2.8, and 2.1.14. Some mitigation measures
are available but do not serve as a substitute for upgrading. To avoid
privilege escalation, limit who has push access to Application source
repositories or `sync` + `override` access to Applications; and limit
which repositories are available in projects where users have `update`
access to Applications. To avoid unauthorized resource
inspection/tampering, limit who has `delete`, `get`, or `action`
access to Applications.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/05/12/1

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable and
accelerate software containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker
Engine) prior to version 20.10.14 where containers were incorrectly
started with non-empty inheritable Linux process capabilities,
creating an atypical Linux environment and enabling programs with
inheritable file capabilities to elevate those capabilities to the
permitted set during `execve(2)`. Normally, when executable programs
have specified permitted file capabilities, otherwise unprivileged
users and processes can execute those programs and gain the specified
file capabilities up to the bounding set. Due to this bug, containers
which included executable programs with inheritable file capabilities
allowed otherwise unprivileged users and processes to additionally
gain these inheritable file capabilities up to the container's
bounding set. Containers which use Linux users and groups to perform
privilege separation inside the container are most directly impacted.
This bug did not affect the container security sandbox as the
inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were included
in the container's bounding set. This bug has been fixed in Moby
(Docker Engine) 20.10.14. Running containers should be stopped,
deleted, and recreated for the inheritable capabilities to be reset.
This fix changes Moby (Docker Engine) behavior such that containers
are started with a more typical Linux environment. As a workaround,
the entry point of a container can be modified to use a utility like
`capsh(1)` to drop inheritable capabilities prior to the primary
process starting.

`gradio` is an open source framework for building interactive machine
learning models and demos. Prior to version 2.8.11, `gradio` suffers
from Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File. The
`gradio` library has a flagging functionality which saves input/output
data into a CSV file on the developer's computer. This can allow a
user to save arbitrary text into the CSV file, such as commands. If a
program like MS Excel opens such a file, then it automatically runs
these commands, which could lead to arbitrary commands running on the
user's computer. The problem has been patched as of `2.8.11`, which
escapes the saved csv with single quotes. As a workaround, avoid
opening csv files generated by `gradio` with Excel or similar
spreadsheet programs.

Forge (also called `node-forge`) is a native implementation of
Transport Layer Security in JavaScript. Prior to version 1.3.0, RSA
PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification code is lenient in checking the
digest algorithm structure. This can allow a crafted structure that
steals padding bytes and uses unchecked portion of the PKCS#1 encoded
message to forge a signature when a low public exponent is being used.
The issue has been addressed in `node-forge` version 1.3.0. There are
currently no known workarounds.

The imgcrypt library provides API exensions for containerd to support
encrypted container images and implements the ctd-decoder command line
tool for use by containerd to decrypt encrypted container images. The
imgcrypt function `CheckAuthorization` is supposed to check whether
the current used is authorized to access an encrypted image and
prevent the user from running an image that another user previously
decrypted on the same system. In versions prior to 1.1.4, a failure
occurs when an image with a ManifestList is used and the architecture
of the local host is not the first one in the ManifestList. Only the
first architecture in the list was tested, which may not have its
layers available locally since it could not be run on the host
architecture. Therefore, the verdict on unavailable layers was that
the image could be run anticipating that image run failure would occur
later due to the layers not being available. However, this verdict to
allow the image to run enabled other architectures in the ManifestList
to run an image without providing keys if that image had previously
been decrypted. A patch has been applied to imgcrypt 1.1.4.
Workarounds may include usage of different namespaces for each remote
user.

altering application logic. The authenticated user may unknowingly
perform the actions by visiting a specially crafted site. Patched in
C1 CMS v6.12, no known workarounds exist.

Puma is a simple, fast, multi-threaded, parallel HTTP 1.1 server for
Ruby/Rack applications. When using Puma behind a proxy that does not
properly validate that the incoming HTTP request matches the RFC7230
standard, Puma and the frontend proxy may disagree on where a request
starts and ends. This would allow requests to be smuggled via the
front-end proxy to Puma. The vulnerability has been fixed in 5.6.4 and
4.3.12. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Workaround:
when deploying a proxy in front of Puma, turning on any and all
functionality to make sure that the request matches the RFC7230
standard.

Wasmtime is a standalone JIT-style runtime for WebAssembly, using
Cranelift. There is a use after free vulnerability in Wasmtime when
both running Wasm that uses externrefs and enabling epoch interruption
in Wasmtime. If you are not explicitly enabling epoch interruption (it
is disabled by default) then you are not affected. If you are
explicitly disabling the Wasm reference types proposal (it is enabled
by default) then you are also not affected. The use after free is
caused by Cranelift failing to emit stack maps when there are
safepoints inside cold blocks. Cold blocks occur when epoch
interruption is enabled. Cold blocks are emitted at the end of
compiled functions, and change the order blocks are emitted versus
defined. This reordering accidentally caused Cranelift to skip
emitting some stack maps because it expected to emit the stack maps in
block definition order, rather than block emission order. When
Wasmtime would eventually collect garbage, it would fail to find live
references on the stack because of the missing stack maps, think that
they were unreferenced garbage, and therefore reclaim them. Then after
the collection ended, the Wasm code could use the reclaimed-too-early
references, which is a use after free. Patches have been released in
versions 0.34.2 and 0.35.2, which fix the vulnerability. All Wasmtime
users are recommended to upgrade to these patched versions. If
upgrading is not an option for you at this time, you can avoid the
vulnerability by either: disabling the Wasm reference types proposal,
config.wasm_reference_types(false); or by disabling epoch interruption
if you were previously enabling it. config.epoch_interruption(false).

PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library
written in C. A buffer overflow vulnerability in versions 2.12 and
prior affects applications that use PJSIP DNS resolution. It doesn't
affect PJSIP users who utilize an external resolver. This
vulnerability is related to CVE-2023-27585. The difference is that
this issue is in parsing the query record `parse_rr()`, while the
issue in CVE-2023-27585 is in `parse_query()`. A patch is available in
the `master` branch of the `pjsip/pjproject` GitHub repository. A
workaround is to disable DNS resolution in PJSIP config (by setting
`nameserver_count` to zero) or use an external resolver instead.

yajl-ruby is a C binding to the YAJL JSON parsing and generation
library. The 1.x branch and the 2.x branch of `yajl` contain an
integer overflow which leads to subsequent heap memory corruption when
dealing with large (~2GB) inputs. The reallocation logic at
`yajl_buf.c#L64` may result in the `need` 32bit integer wrapping to 0
when `need` approaches a value of 0x80000000 (i.e. ~2GB of data),
which results in a reallocation of buf->alloc into a small heap chunk.
These integers are declared as `size_t` in the 2.x branch of `yajl`,
which practically prevents the issue from triggering on 64bit
platforms, however this does not preclude this issue triggering on
32bit builds on which `size_t` is a 32bit integer. Subsequent
population of this under-allocated heap chunk is based on the original
buffer size, leading to heap memory corruption. This vulnerability
mostly impacts process availability. Maintainers believe exploitation
for arbitrary code execution is unlikely. A patch is available and
anticipated to be part of yajl-ruby version 1.4.2. As a workaround,
avoid passing large inputs to YAJL.

RaspberryMatic is a free and open-source operating system for running
a cloud-free smart-home using the homematicIP / HomeMatic hardware
line of IoT devices. A Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in
the file upload facility of the WebUI interface of RaspberryMatic
exists. Missing input validation/sanitization in the file upload
mechanism allows remote, unauthenticated attackers with network access
to the WebUI interface to achieve arbitrary operating system command
execution via shell metacharacters in the HTTP query string. Injected
commands are executed as root, thus leading to a full compromise of
the underlying system and all its components. Versions after
`2.31.25.20180428` and prior to `3.63.8.20220330` are affected. Users
are advised to update to version `3.63.8.20220330` or newer. There are
currently no known workarounds to mitigate the security impact and
users are advised to update to the latest version available.

Internet Routing Registry daemon version 4 is an IRR database server,
processing IRR objects in the RPSL format. IRRd did not always filter
password hashes in query responses relating to `mntner` objects and
database exports. This may have allowed adversaries to retrieve some
of these hashes, perform a brute-force search for the clear-text
passphrase, and use these to make unauthorised changes to affected IRR
objects. This issue only affected instances that process password
hashes, which means it is limited to IRRd instances that serve
authoritative databases. IRRd instances operating solely as mirrors of
other IRR databases are not affected. This has been fixed in IRRd
4.2.3 and the main branch. Versions in the 4.1.x series never were
affected. Users of the 4.2.x series are strongly recommended to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

wire-webapp is the web application interface for the wire messaging
service. Insufficient escaping in markdown &#8220;code highlighting&#8221; in the
wire-webapp resulted in the possibility of injecting and executing
arbitrary HTML code and thus also JavaScript. If a user receives and
views such a malicious message, arbitrary code is injected and
executed in the context of the victim. This allows the attacker to

October/System is the system module for October CMS, a self-hosted CMS
platform based on the Laravel PHP Framework. Prior to versions
1.0.476, 1.1.12, and 2.2.15, when the developer allows the user to
specify their own filename in the `fromData` method, an
unauthenticated user can perform remote code execution (RCE) by
exploiting a race condition in the temporary storage directory. This
vulnerability affects plugins that expose the
`October\Rain\Database\Attach\File::fromData` as a public interface
and does not affect vanilla installations of October CMS since this
method is not exposed or used by the system internally or externally.
The issue has been patched in Build 476 (v1.0.476), v1.1.12, and
v2.2.15. Those who are unable to upgrade may apply with patch to their
installation manually as a workaround.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00003.html

Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications,
supporting Python 3.6+. Prior to version 22.4.0rc1, the Twisted Web
HTTP 1.1 server, located in the `twisted.web.http` module, parsed
several HTTP request constructs more leniently than permitted by RFC
7230. This non-conformant parsing can lead to desync if requests pass
through multiple HTTP parsers, potentially resulting in HTTP request
smuggling. Users who may be affected use Twisted Web's HTTP 1.1 server
and/or proxy and also pass requests through a different HTTP server
and/or proxy. The Twisted Web client is not affected. The HTTP 2.0
server uses a different parser, so it is not affected. The issue has
been addressed in Twisted 22.4.0rc1. Two workarounds are available:
Ensure any vulnerabilities in upstream proxies have been addressed,
such as by upgrading them; or filter malformed requests by other
means, such as configuration of an upstream proxy.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
When fine-grained access control is enabled and a client uses Grafana
API Key to make requests, the permissions for that API Key are cached
for 30 seconds for the given organization. Because of the way the
cache ID is constructed, the consequent requests with any API Key
evaluate to the same permissions as the previous requests. This can
lead to an escalation of privileges, when for example a first request
is made with Admin permissions, and the second request with different
API Key is made with Viewer permissions, the second request will get
the cached permissions from the previous Admin, essentially accessing
higher privilege than it should. The vulnerability is only impacting
Grafana Enterprise when the fine-grained access control beta feature
is enabled and there are more than one API Keys in one organization
with different roles assigned. All installations after Grafana
Enterprise v8.1.0-beta1 should be upgraded as soon as possible. As an
alternative, disable fine-grained access control will mitigate the
vulnerability.

JHipster is a development platform to quickly generate, develop, &
deploy modern web applications & microservice architectures. SQL
Injection vulnerability in entities for applications generated with
the option "reactive with Spring WebFlux" enabled and an SQL database
using r2dbc. Applications created without "reactive with Spring
WebFlux" and applications with NoSQL databases are not affected. Users
who have generated a microservice Gateway using the affected version
may be impacted as Gateways are reactive by default. Currently, SQL
injection is possible in the findAllBy(Pageable pageable, Criteria
criteria) method of an entity repository class generated in these
applications as the where clause using Criteria for queries are not
sanitized and user input is passed on as it is by the criteria. This
issue has been patched in v7.8.1. Users unable to upgrade should be
careful when combining criterias and conditions as the root of the
issue lies in the `EntityManager.java` class when creating the where
clause via `Conditions.just(criteria.toString())`. `just` accepts the
literal string provided. Criteria's `toString` method returns a plain
string and this combination is vulnerable to sql injection as the
string is not sanitized and will contain whatever used passed as input
using any plain SQL.

Flux2 is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for
Kubernetes. Flux2 versions between 0.1.0 and 0.29.0, helm-controller
0.1.0 to v0.19.0, and kustomize-controller 0.1.0 to v0.23.0 are
vulnerable to Code Injection via malicious Kubeconfig. In multi-
tenancy deployments this can also lead to privilege escalation if the
controller's service account has elevated permissions. Workarounds
include disabling functionality via Validating Admission webhooks by
restricting users from setting the `spec.kubeConfig` field in Flux
`Kustomization` and `HelmRelease` objects. Additional mitigations
include applying restrictive AppArmor and SELinux profiles on the
controller&#8217;s pod to limit what binaries can be executed. This
vulnerability is fixed in kustomize-controller v0.23.0 and helm-

Similar to the Log4J case, the vulnerability can be triggered if the
JNDI names are user-provided, but requires admin-level login to be
triggered. The lookups are now restricted in GeoTools 26.4, GeoTools
25.6, and GeoTools 24.6. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that
any downstream application should not allow usage of remotely provided
JNDI strings.

Discourse is an open source platform for community discussion. In
affected versions an attacker can poison the cache for anonymous (i.e.
not logged in) users, such that the users are shown the crawler view
of the site instead of the HTML page. This can lead to a partial
denial-of-service. This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta
and tests-passed versions of Discourse. There are no known workarounds
for this issue.

Smokescreen is a simple HTTP proxy that fogs over naughty URLs. The
primary use case for Smokescreen is to prevent server-side request
forgery (SSRF) attacks in which external attackers leverage the
behavior of applications to connect to or scan internal
infrastructure. Smokescreen also offers an option to deny access to
additional (e.g., external) URLs by way of a deny list. There was an
issue in Smokescreen that made it possible to bypass the deny list
feature by appending a dot to the end of user-supplied URLs, or by
providing input in a different letter case. Recommended to upgrade
Smokescreen to version 0.0.3 or later.

On Windows, if Git LFS operates on a malicious repository with a
`..exe` file as well as a file named `git.exe`, and `git.exe` is not
found in `PATH`, the `..exe` program will be executed, permitting the
attacker to execute arbitrary code. This does not affect Unix systems.
Similarly, if the malicious repository contains files named `..exe`
and `cygpath.exe`, and `cygpath.exe` is not found in `PATH`, the
`..exe` program will be executed when certain Git LFS commands are
run. More generally, if the current working directory contains any
file with a base name of `.` and a file extension from `PATHEXT`
(except `.bat` and `.cmd`), and also contains another file with the
same base name as a program Git LFS intends to execute (such as `git`,
`cygpath`, or `uname`) and any file extension from `PATHEXT`
(including `.bat` and `.cmd`), then, on Windows, when Git LFS attempts
to execute the intended program the `..exe`, `..com`, etc., file will
be executed instead, but only if the intended program is not found in
any directory listed in `PATH`. The vulnerability occurs because when
Git LFS detects that the program it intends to run does not exist in
any directory listed in `PATH` then Git LFS passes an empty string as
the executable file path to the Go `os/exec` package, which contains a
bug such that, on Windows, it prepends the name of the current working
directory (i.e., `.`) to the empty string without adding a path
separator, and as a result searches in that directory for a file with
the base name `.` combined with any file extension from `PATHEXT`,
executing the first one it finds. (The reason `..bat` and `..cmd`
files are not executed in the same manner is that, although the Go
`os/exec` package tries to execute them just as it does a `..exe`
file, the Microsoft Win32 API `CreateProcess()` family of functions
have an undocumented feature in that they apparently recognize when a
caller is attempting to execute a batch script file and instead run
the `cmd.exe` command interpreter, passing the full set of command
line arguments as parameters. These are unchanged from the command
line arguments set by Git LFS, and as such, the intended program's
name is the first, resulting in a command line like `cmd.exe /c git`,
which then fails.) Git LFS has resolved this vulnerability by always
reporting an error when a program is not found in any directory listed
in `PATH` rather than passing an empty string to the Go `os/exec`
package in this case. The bug in the Go `os/exec` package has been
reported to the Go project and is expected to be patched after this
security advisory is published. The problem was introduced in version
2.12.1 and is patched in version 3.1.3. Users of affected versions
should upgrade to version 3.1.3. There are currently no known
workarounds at this time.

Elide is a Java library that lets you stand up a GraphQL/JSON-API web
service with minimal effort. When leveraging the following together:
Elide Aggregation Data Store for Analytic Queries, Parameterized
Columns (A column that requires a client provided parameter), and a
parameterized column of type TEXT. There is the potential for a hacker
to provide a carefully crafted query that would bypass server side
authorization filters through SQL injection. A recent patch to Elide
6.1.2 allowed the '-' character to be included in parameterized TEXT
columns. This character can be interpreted as SQL comments ('--') and
allow the attacker to remove the WHERE clause from the generated query
and bypass authorization filters. A fix is provided in Elide 6.1.4.
The vulnerability only exists for parameterized columns of type TEXT
and only for analytic queries (CRUD is not impacted). Workarounds
include leveraging a different type of parameterized column (TIME,
MONEY, etc) or not leveraging parameterized columns.

Composer is a dependency manager for the PHP programming language.
Integrators using Composer code to call `VcsDriver::getFileContent`
can have a code injection vulnerability if the user can control the
`$file` or `$identifier` argument. This leads to a vulnerability on
packagist.org for example where the composer.json's `readme` field can
be used as a vector for injecting parameters into hg/Mercurial via the
`$file` argument, or git via the `$identifier` argument if you allow
arbitrary data there (Packagist does not, but maybe other integrators
do). Composer itself should not be affected by the vulnerability as it
does not call `getFileContent` with arbitrary data into
`$file`/`$identifier`. To the best of our knowledge this was not
abused, and the vulnerability has been patched on packagist.org and
Private Packagist within a day of the vulnerability report.

Garden is an automation platform for Kubernetes development and
testing. In versions prior to 0.12.39 multiple endpoints did not
require authentication. In some operating modes this allows for an
attacker to gain access to the application erroneously. The
configuration is leaked through the /api endpoint on the local server
that is responsible for serving the Garden dashboard. At the moment,
this server is accessible to 0.0.0.0 which makes it accessible to
anyone on the same network (or anyone on the internet if they are on a
public, static IP). This may lead to the ability to compromise
credentials, secrets or environment variables. Users are advised to
upgrade to version 0.12.39 as soon as possible. Users unable to
upgrade should use a firewall blocking access to port 9777 from all
untrusted network machines.

GoCD is an open source a continuous delivery server. The bundled gocd-
ldap-authentication-plugin included with the GoCD Server fails to
correctly escape special characters when using the username to
construct LDAP queries. While this does not directly allow arbitrary
LDAP data exfiltration, it can allow an existing LDAP-authenticated
GoCD user with malicious intent to construct and execute malicious
queries, allowing them to deduce facts about other users or entries
within the LDAP database (e.g alternate fields, usernames, hashed
passwords etc) through brute force mechanisms. This only affects users
who have a working LDAP authorization configuration enabled on their
GoCD server, and only is exploitable by users authenticating using
such an LDAP configuration. This issue has been fixed in GoCD 22.1.0,
which is bundled with gocd-ldap-authentication-plugin v2.2.0-144.

All versions of fleet making use of the teams feature are affected by
this authorization bypass issue. Fleet instances without teams, or
with teams but without restricted team accounts are not affected. In
affected versions a team admin can erroneously add themselves as
admin, maintainer or observer on other teams. Users are advised to
upgrade to version 4.13. There are no known workarounds for this
issue.

MinIO is a High Performance Object Storage released under GNU Affero
General Public License v3.0. A security issue was found where an non-
admin user is able to create service accounts for root or other admin
users and then is able to assume their access policies via the
generated credentials. This in turn allows the user to escalate
privilege to that of the root user. This vulnerability has been
resolved in pull request #14729 and is included in
`RELEASE.2022-04-12T06-55-35Z`. Users unable to upgrade may workaround
this issue by explicitly adding a `admin:CreateServiceAccount` deny
policy, however, this, in turn, denies the user the ability to create
their own service accounts as well.

GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that
allows users to share and edit geospatial data. The GeoServer security
mechanism can perform an unchecked JNDI lookup, which in turn can be
used to perform class deserialization and result in arbitrary code
execution. The same can happen while configuring data stores with data
sources located in JNDI, or while setting up the disk quota mechanism.
In order to perform any of the above changes, the attack needs to have
obtained admin rights and use either the GeoServer GUI, or its REST
API. The lookups are going to be restricted in GeoServer 2.21.0,
2.20.4, 1.19.6. Users unable to upgrade should restrict access to the
`geoserver/web` and `geoserver/rest` via a firewall and ensure that
the GeoWebCache is not remotely accessible.

DHIS2 is an information system for data capture, management,
validation, analytics and visualization. A SQL injection security
vulnerability affects the `/api/programs/orgUnits?programs=` API
endpoint in DHIS2 versions prior to 2.36.10.1 and 2.37.6.1. The system
is vulnerable to attack only from users that are logged in to DHIS2,
and there is no known way of exploiting the vulnerability without
first being logged in as a DHIS2 user. The vulnerability is not
exposed to a non-malicious user and requires a conscious attack to be
exploited. A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow the
malicious user to read, edit and delete data in the DHIS2 instance's
database. Security patches are now available for DHIS2 versions
2.36.10.1 and 2.37.6.1. One may apply mitigations at the web proxy
level as a workaround. More information about these mitigations is
available in the GitHub Security Advisory.

LDAP Account Manager (LAM) is an open source web frontend for managing
entries stored in an LDAP directory. The profile editor tool has an
edit profile functionality, the parameters on this page are not
properly sanitized and hence leads to stored XSS attacks. An
authenticated user can store XSS payloads in the profiles, which gets
triggered when any other user try to access the edit profile page. The
pdf editor tool has an edit pdf profile functionality, the logoFile
parameter in it is not properly sanitized and an user can enter
relative paths like ../../../../../../../../../../../../../usr/share/i
cons/hicolor/48x48/apps/gvim.png via tools like burpsuite. Later when
a pdf is exported using the edited profile the pdf icon has the image
on that path(if image is present). Both issues require an attacker to
be able to login to LAM admin interface. The issue is fixed in version
7.9.1.

as part of our GeoJSON support. While we do validation to not return
contents of arbitrary URLs, there is a case where a particularly
crafted request could result in file access on windows, which allows
enabling an `NTLM relay attack`, potentially allowing an attacker to

Metabase is an open source business intelligence and analytics

which allows connecting multiple SQLite databases via the initial
connection. If the attacker has SQL permissions to at least one SQLite
database, then it can attach this database to a second database, and
then it can query across all the tables. To be able to do that the
attacker also needs to know the file path to the second database.
Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. If you're unable to
upgrade, you can modify your SQLIte connection strings to contain the
url argument `?limit_attached=0`, which will disallow making
connections to other SQLite databases. Only users making use of SQLite
are affected.

django-mfa3 is a library that implements multi factor authentication
for the django web framework. It achieves this by modifying the
regular login view. Django however has a second login view for its
admin area. This second login view was not modified, so the multi
factor authentication can be bypassed. Users are affected if they have
activated both django-mfa3 (< 0.5.0) and django.contrib.admin and have
not taken any other measures to prevent users from accessing the admin
login view. The issue has been fixed in django-mfa3 0.5.0. It is
possible to work around the issue by overwriting the admin login
route, e.g. by adding the following URL definition *before* the admin
routes: url('admin/login/', lambda request:
redirect(settings.LOGIN_URL)

recipient is using an email program that is susceptible to XSS, then
that email recipient will receive an email that may contain malicious
XSS. Regardless if the email recipient&#8217;s mail program has
vulnerabilities or not, the hacker can at the very least inject
malicious HTML that modifies the body content of the email. There are

only leaked to trusted staff member, but for sites with assign
features enabled publicly, the data was accessible to more people than
just staff. Version 1.0.1 contains a patch. There are currently no

generate templates. In versions prior to 1.0.0.beta.2, attackers can
implement remote code execution through malicious code injection of
the template engine. This happens because Velocity and freemarker
templates are introduced but input verification is not done. The fault
is rectified in version 1.0.0.beta.2.

FreeRDP is a free implementation of the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
Prior to version 2.7.0, server side authentication against a `SAM`
file might be successful for invalid credentials if the server has
configured an invalid `SAM` file path. FreeRDP based clients are not
affected. RDP server implementations using FreeRDP to authenticate
against a `SAM` file are affected. Version 2.7.0 contains a fix for
this issue. As a workaround, use custom authentication via
`HashCallback` and/or ensure the `SAM` database path configured is
valid and the application has file handles left.

ecdsautils is a tiny collection of programs used for ECDSA (keygen,
sign, verify). `ecdsa_verify_[prepare_]legacy()` does not check
whether the signature values `r` and `s` are non-zero. A signature
consisting only of zeroes is always considered valid, making it
trivial to forge signatures. Requiring multiple signatures from
different public keys does not mitigate the issue:
`ecdsa_verify_list_legacy()` will accept an arbitrary number of such
forged signatures. Both the `ecdsautil verify` CLI command and the
libecdsautil library are affected. The issue has been fixed in
ecdsautils 0.4.1. All older versions of ecdsautils (including versions
before the split into a library and a CLI utility) are vulnerable.

Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set

reverse proxy: It caches entire responses (including headers) and
returns them to the clients. In a recent change in the
`AbstractSessionListener`, the response might contain a `Set-Cookie`
header. If the Symfony HTTP cache system is enabled, this response
might bill stored and return to the next clients. An attacker can use
this vulnerability to retrieve the victim's session. This issue has

Symfony is a PHP framework for web and console applications and a set
of reusable PHP components. When authenticating users Symfony by
default regenerates the session ID upon login, but preserves the rest
of session attributes. Because this does not clear CSRF tokens upon
login, this might enables same-site attackers to bypass the CSRF
protection mechanism by performing an attack similar to a session-
fixation. This issue has been fixed in the 4.4 branch.

12.6.7, 12.10.3, and 13.0, the velocity scripts are not properly
sandboxed against using the Java File API to perform read or write
operations on the filesystem. Writing an attacking script in Velocity
requires the Script rights in XWiki so not all users can use it, and
it also requires finding an XWiki API which returns a File. The
problem has been patched in versions 12.6.7, 12.10.3, and 13.0. There
is no easy workaround for fixing this vulnerability other than

Piano LED Visualizer is software that allows LED lights to light up as
a person plays a piano connected to a computer. Version 1.3 and prior
are vulnerable to a path traversal attack. The `os.path.join` call is
unsafe for use with untrusted input. When the `os.path.join` call
encounters an absolute path, it ignores all the parameters it has
encountered till that point and starts working with the new absolute
path. Since the "malicious" parameter represents an absolute path, the
result of `os.path.join` ignores the static directory completely.
Hence, untrusted input is passed via the `os.path.join` call to
`flask.send_file` can lead to path traversal attacks. A patch with a
fix is available on the `master` branch of the GitHub repository. This
can also be fixed by preventing flow of untrusted data to the
vulnerable `send_file` function. In case the application logic
necessiates this behaviour, one can either use the `flask.safe_join`
to join untrusted paths or replace `flask.send_file` calls with
`flask.send_from_directory` calls.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/05/msg00028.html

Rsyslog is a rocket-fast system for log processing. Modules for TCP
syslog reception have a potential heap buffer overflow when octet-
counted framing is used. This can result in a segfault or some other
malfunction. As of our understanding, this vulnerability can not be
used for remote code execution. But there may still be a slight chance
for experts to do that. The bug occurs when the octet count is read.
While there is a check for the maximum number of octets, digits are
written to a heap buffer even when the octet count is over the
maximum, This can be used to overrun the memory buffer. However, once
the sequence of digits stop, no additional characters can be added to
the buffer. In our opinion, this makes remote exploits impossible or
at least highly complex. Octet-counted framing is one of two potential
framing modes. It is relatively uncommon, but enabled by default on
receivers. Modules `imtcp`, `imptcp`, `imgssapi`, and `imhttp` are
used for regular syslog message reception. It is best practice not to
directly expose them to the public. When this practice is followed,
the risk is considerably lower. Module `imdiag` is a diagnostics
module primarily intended for testbench runs. We do not expect it to
be present on any production installation. Octet-counted framing is
not very common. Usually, it needs to be specifically enabled at
senders. If users do not need it, they can turn it off for the most
important modules. This will mitigate the vulnerability.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. Argo CD starting with version 0.7.0 and prior to versions
2.1.15m 2.2.9, and 2.3.4 is vulnerable to a symlink following bug
allowing a malicious user with repository write access to leak
sensitive files from Argo CD's repo-server. A malicious Argo CD user
with write access for a repository which is (or may be) used in a
directory-type Application may commit a symlink which points to an
out-of-bounds file. Sensitive files which could be leaked include
manifest files from other Applications' source repositories
(potentially decrypted files, if you are using a decryption plugin) or
any JSON-formatted secrets which have been mounted as files on the
repo-server. A patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo
CD versions 2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. Users of versions 2.3.0 or above
who do not have any Jsonnet/directory-type Applications may disable
the Jsonnet/directory config management tool as a workaround.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. A vulnerability was found in Argo CD prior to versions
2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15 that allows an attacker to spoof error
messages on the login screen when single sign on (SSO) is enabled. In
order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would have to trick
the victim to visit a specially crafted URL which contains the message
to be displayed. As far as the research of the Argo CD team concluded,
it is not possible to specify any active content (e.g. Javascript) or
other HTML fragments (e.g. clickable links) in the spoofed message. A
patch for this vulnerability has been released in Argo CD versions
2.3.4, 2.2.9, and 2.1.15. There are currently no known workarounds.

Reference: MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20230130 [SECURITY] [DLA 3299-1] node-qs security update
Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00039.html

qs before 6.10.3, as used in Express before 4.17.3 and other products,
allows attackers to cause a Node process hang for an Express
application because an __ proto__ key can be used. In many typical
Express use cases, an unauthenticated remote attacker can place the
attack payload in the query string of the URL that is used to visit
the application, such as
a[__proto__]=b&a[__proto__]&a[length]=100000000. The fix was
backported to qs 6.9.7, 6.8.3, 6.7.3, 6.6.1, 6.5.3, 6.4.1, 6.3.3, and
6.2.4 (and therefore Express 4.17.3, which has "deps: qs@6.9.7" in its
release description, is not vulnerable).

A vulnerability exists in the HCI IEC 60870-5-104 function included in
certain versions of the RTU500 series product. The vulnerability can
only be exploited, if the HCI 60870-5-104 is configured with support
for IEC 62351-5 and the CMU contains the license feature &#8216;Advanced
security&#8217; which must be ordered separately. If these preconditions are
fulfilled, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending a
specially crafted message to the RTU500, causing the targeted RTU500
CMU to reboot. The vulnerability is caused by a missing input data
validation which eventually if exploited causes an internal buffer to
overflow in the HCI IEC 60870-5-104 function.

Dm-verity is used for extending root-of-trust to root filesystems.
LoadPin builds on this property to restrict module/firmware loads to
just the trusted root filesystem. Device-mapper table reloads
currently allow users with root privileges to switch out the target
with an equivalent dm-linear target and bypass verification till
reboot. This allows root to bypass LoadPin and can be used to load
untrusted and unverified kernel modules and firmware, which implies
arbitrary kernel execution and persistence for peripherals that do not
verify firmware updates. We recommend upgrading past commit

An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. A TOCTOU race
condition exists during the validation of VPN configuration files.
This allows parameters outside of the AWS VPN Client allow list to be
injected into the configuration file prior to the AWS VPN Client
service (running as SYSTEM) processing the file. Dangerous arguments
can be injected by a low-level user such as log, which allows an
arbitrary destination to be specified for writing log files. This
leads to an arbitrary file write as SYSTEM with partial control over
the files content. This can be abused to cause an elevation of
privilege or denial of service.

An issue was discovered in Amazon AWS VPN Client 2.0.0. It is possible
to include a UNC path in the OpenVPN configuration file when
referencing file paths for parameters (such as auth-user-pass). When
this file is imported and the client attempts to validate the file
path, it performs an open operation on the path and leaks the user's
Net-NTLMv2 hash to an external server. This could be exploited by
having a user open a crafted malicious ovpn configuration file.

Apache Hadoop's FileUtil.unTar(File, File) API does not escape the
input file name before being passed to the shell. An attacker can
inject arbitrary commands. This is only used in Hadoop 3.3
InMemoryAliasMap.completeBootstrapTransfer, which is only ever run by
a local user. It has been used in Hadoop 2.x for yarn localization,
which does enable remote code execution. It is used in Apache Spark,
from the SQL command ADD ARCHIVE. As the ADD ARCHIVE command adds new
binaries to the classpath, being able to execute shell scripts does
not confer new permissions to the caller. SPARK-38305. "Check
existence of file before untarring/zipping", which is included in
3.3.0, 3.1.4, 3.2.2, prevents shell commands being executed,
regardless of which version of the hadoop libraries are in use. Users

included in the version 22.5.9.163 of the K2 firmware, and version
32.1.15.93 of the K3C firmware (possibly amongst many other releases)
included both the private and public RSA keys. The remaining versions
cited here redacted the private key, but left the public key
unchanged. An attacker in possession of the leaked private key may,
through a scripted exchange of UDP packets, instruct telnetd_startup
to spawn an unauthenticated telnet shell as root, by means of which
they can then obtain complete control of the device. A consequence of
the limited availablility of firmware images for testing is that
models and versions not listed here may share this vulnerability.

Name: CVE-2022-25218
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2022-01
Reference: URL:https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2022-01

The use of the RSA algorithm without OAEP, or any other padding
scheme, in telnetd_startup, allows an unauthenticated attacker on the
local area network to achieve a significant degree of control over the
"plaintext" to which an arbitrary blob of ciphertext will be decrypted
by OpenSSL's RSA_public_decrypt() function. This weakness allows the
attacker to manipulate the various iterations of the telnetd startup
state machine and eventually obtain a root shell on the device, by
means of an exchange of crafted UDP packets. In all versions but K2
22.5.9.163 and K3C 32.1.15.93 a successful attack also requires the
exploitation of a null-byte interaction error (CVE-2022-25219).

======================================================
Name: CVE-2022-25219
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2022-01
Reference: URL:https://www.tenable.com/security/research/tra-2022-01

A null byte interaction error has been discovered in the code that the
telnetd_startup daemon uses to construct a pair of ephemeral passwords
that allow a user to spawn a telnet service on the router, and to
ensure that the telnet service persists upon reboot. By means of a
crafted exchange of UDP packets, an unauthenticated attacker on the
local network can leverage this null byte interaction error in such a
way as to make those ephemeral passwords predictable (with 1-in-94
odds). Since the attacker must manipulate data processed by the
OpenSSL function RSA_public_decrypt(), successful exploitation of this
vulnerability depends on the use of an unpadded RSA cipher
(CVE-2022-25218).

A use-after-free vulnerability was found in systemd. This issue occurs
due to the on_stream_io() function and dns_stream_complete() function

can dereference the DNSStream object, causing the use-after-free when
the reference is still used later.

Drupal 9.3 implemented a generic entity access API for entity
revisions. However, this API was not completely integrated with
existing permissions, resulting in some possible access bypass for
users who have access to use revisions of content generally, but who
do not have access to individual items of node and media content. This
vulnerability only affects sites using Drupal's revision system.

In some situations, the Image module does not correctly check access
to image files not stored in the standard public files directory when
generating derivative images using the image styles system. Access to
a non-public file is checked only if it is stored in the "private"
file system. However, some contributed modules provide additional file
systems, or schemes, which may lead to this vulnerability. This
vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that it only applies when the
site sets (Drupal 9)
$config['image.settings']['allow_insecure_derivatives'] or (Drupal 7)
$conf['image_allow_insecure_derivatives'] to TRUE. The recommended and
default setting is FALSE, and Drupal core does not provide a way to
change that in the admin UI. Some sites may require configuration
changes following this security release. Review the release notes for
your Drupal version if you have issues accessing files or image styles
after updating.

Drupal core sanitizes filenames with dangerous extensions upon upload
(reference: SA-CORE-2020-012) and strips leading and trailing dots
from filenames to prevent uploading server configuration files
(reference: SA-CORE-2019-010). However, the protections for these two
vulnerabilities previously did not work correctly together. As a
result, if the site were configured to allow the upload of files with
an htaccess extension, these files' filenames would not be properly
sanitized. This could allow bypassing the protections provided by
Drupal core's default .htaccess files and possible remote code
execution on Apache web servers. This issue is mitigated by the fact
that it requires a field administrator to explicitly configure a file
field to allow htaccess as an extension (a restricted permission), or
a contributed module or custom code that overrides allowed file
uploads.
