The POST SMTP Mailer plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.0.20. This is due
to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the handleCsvExport()
function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
trigger a CSV export via a forged request granted they can trick a
site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
link.

A vulnerability has been identified in SIMATIC eaSie Core Package (All

does not perform authentication in the default configuration. This
could allow an unauthenticated remote attacker to send arbitrary
messages to the service and thereby issue arbitrary requests in the

Reference: MISC:https://vavkamil.cz/2021/11/25/wordpress-plugin-confusion-update-can-get-you-pwned/

WordPress before 5.8 lacks support for the Update URI plugin header.
This makes it easier for remote attackers to execute arbitrary code
via a supply-chain attack against WordPress installations that use any
plugin for which the slug satisfies the naming constraints of the
WordPress.org Plugin Directory but is not yet present in that
directory.

Apache Log4j2 2.0-beta9 through 2.15.0 (excluding security releases
2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1) JNDI features used in configuration, log
messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled
LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log
messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded
from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From
log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. From version
2.16.0 (along with 2.12.2, 2.12.3, and 2.3.1), this functionality has
been completely removed. Note that this vulnerability is specific to
log4j-core and does not affect log4net, log4cxx, or other Apache
Logging Services projects.

admin-display.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated
attackers to edit the plugins settings via a forged request granted
they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
clicking on a link.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/02/11/4

When running Apache Cassandra with the following configuration:
enable_user_defined_functions: true
enable_scripted_user_defined_functions: true
enable_user_defined_functions_threads: false it is possible for an
attacker to execute arbitrary code on the host. The attacker would
need to have enough permissions to create user defined functions in
the cluster to be able to exploit this. Note that this configuration
is documented as unsafe, and will continue to be considered unsafe
after this CVE.

Accepting arbitrary Subject Alternative Name (SAN) types, unless a PKI
is specifically defined to use a particular SAN type, can result in
bypassing name-constrained intermediates. Node.js < 12.22.9, <
14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 was accepting URI SAN types, which
PKIs are often not defined to use. Additionally, when a protocol
allows URI SANs, Node.js did not match the URI correctly.Versions of
Node.js with the fix for this disable the URI SAN type when checking a
certificate against a hostname. This behavior can be reverted through
the --security-revert command-line option.

Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 converts SANs
(Subject Alternative Names) to a string format. It uses this string to
check peer certificates against hostnames when validating connections.
The string format was subject to an injection vulnerability when name
constraints were used within a certificate chain, allowing the bypass
of these name constraints.Versions of Node.js with the fix for this
escape SANs containing the problematic characters in order to prevent
the injection. This behavior can be reverted through the --security-
revert command-line option.

Node.js < 12.22.9, < 14.18.3, < 16.13.2, and < 17.3.1 did not handle
multi-value Relative Distinguished Names correctly. Attackers could
craft certificate subjects containing a single-value Relative
Distinguished Name that would be interpreted as a multi-value Relative
Distinguished Name, for example, in order to inject a Common Name that
would allow bypassing the certificate subject verification.Affected
versions of Node.js that do not accept multi-value Relative
Distinguished Names and are thus not vulnerable to such attacks
themselves. However, third-party code that uses node's ambiguous
presentation of certificate subjects may be vulnerable.

Apache Sling Commons Messaging Mail provides a simple layer on top of
JavaMail/Jakarta Mail for OSGi to send mails via SMTPS. To reduce the
risk of "man in the middle" attacks additional server identity checks
must be performed when accessing mail servers. For compatibility
reasons these additional checks are disabled by default in
JavaMail/Jakarta Mail. The SimpleMailService in Apache Sling Commons
Messaging Mail 1.0 lacks an option to enable these checks for the
shared mail session. A user could enable these checks nevertheless by
accessing the session via the message created by SimpleMessageBuilder
and setting the property mail.smtps.ssl.checkserveridentity to true.
Apache Sling Commons Messaging Mail 2.0 adds support for enabling
server identity checks and these checks are enabled by default. -

Reference: MISC:https://www.buddyboss.com/resources/buddyboss-platform-releases/
Reference: MISC:https://www.cygenta.co.uk/post/buddyboss

BuddyBoss Platform through 1.8.0 allows remote attackers to obtain the
email address of each user. When creating a new user, it generates a
Unique ID for their profile. This UID is their private email address
with symbols removed and periods replaced with hyphens. For example.
JohnDoe@example.com would become /members/johndoeexample-com and
Jo.test@example.com would become /members/jo-testexample-com. The
members list is available to everyone and (in a default configuration)
often without authentication. It is therefore trivial to collect a
list of email addresses.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/30/2

A race condition existed in the snapd 2.54.2 snap-confine binary when
preparing a private mount namespace for a snap. This could allow a
local attacker to gain root privileges by bind-mounting their own
contents inside the snap's private mount namespace and causing snap-
confine to execute arbitrary code and hence gain privilege escalation.
Fixed in snapd versions 2.54.3+18.04, 2.54.3+20.04 and 2.54.3+21.10.1

On Xilinx Zynq-7000 SoC devices, physical modification of an SD boot
image allows for a buffer overflow attack in the ROM. Because the
Zynq-7000's boot image header is unencrypted and unauthenticated
before use, an attacker can modify the boot header stored on an SD
card so that a secure image appears to be unencrypted, and they will
be able to modify the full range of register initialization values.
Normally, these registers will be restricted when booting securely. Of
importance to this attack are two registers that control the SD card's
transfer type and transfer size. These registers could be modified a
way that causes a buffer overflow in the ROM.

without an explicit configuration on its side or for the "idtoken"

Specification. The "none" algorithm does not require any signature
verification when validating the ID tokens, which allows the attacker
to bypass the token validation by injecting a malformed ID token using
"none" as the value of "alg" key in the header with an empty signature
value.

It was found that the fix to address CVE-2021-44228 in Apache Log4j
2.15.0 was incomplete in certain non-default configurations. This
could allows attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC)
input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern
Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or
a Thread Context Map pattern (%X, %mdc, or %MDC) to craft malicious
input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern resulting in an information
leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code
execution in all environments. Log4j 2.16.0 (Java 8) and 2.12.2 (Java
7) fix this issue by removing support for message lookup patterns and
disabling JNDI functionality by default.

An issue was discovered in Suricata before 6.0.4. It is possible to
bypass/evade any HTTP-based signature by faking an RST TCP packet with
random TCP options of the md5header from the client side. After the
three-way handshake, it's possible to inject an RST ACK with a random
TCP md5header option. Then, the client can send an HTTP GET request
with a forbidden URL. The server will ignore the RST ACK and send the
response HTTP packet for the client's request. These packets will not
trigger a Suricata reject action.

The ksmbd server through 3.4.2, as used in the Linux kernel through
5.15.8, sometimes communicates in cleartext even though encryption has
been enabled. This occurs because it sets the
SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION flag when using the SMB 3.1.1 protocol,
which is a violation of the SMB protocol specification. When Windows
10 detects this protocol violation, it disables encryption.

Pentaho Business Analytics Server versions before 9.2.0.2 and 8.3.0.25
using the Pentaho Analyzer plugin exposes a service endpoint for
templates which allows a user-supplied path to access resources that
are out of bounds. The software uses external input to construct a
pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is
located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software
does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that
can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the
restricted directory. By using special elements such as ".." and "/"
separators, attackers can escape outside of the restricted location to
access files or directories that are elsewhere on the system.

during login. This only affects users if they are on Docker Desktop
4.3.0, 4.3.1 and the user has logged in while on 4.3.0, 4.3.1. Gaining
access to this data would require having access to the user&#8217;s local

In the IPv6 implementation in the Linux kernel before 5.13.3,
net/ipv6/output_core.c has an information leak because of certain use
of a hash table which, although big, doesn't properly consider that
IPv6-based attackers can typically choose among many IPv6 source
addresses.

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://controlgap.com/blog?tag=insecurity
Reference: MISC:https://www.controlgap.com/blog/sage-300-case-study

In Sage 300 ERP (formerly accpac) through 6.8.x, the installer
configures the C:\Sage\Sage300\Runtime directory to be the first entry
in the system-wide PATH environment variable. However, this directory
is writable by unprivileged users because the Sage installer fails to
set explicit permissions and therefore inherits weak permissions from
the C:\ folder. Because entries in the system-wide PATH variable are
included in the search order for DLLs, an attacker could perform DLL
search-order hijacking to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM.
Furthermore, if the Global Search or Web Screens functionality is
enabled, then privilege escalation is possible via the
GlobalSearchService and Sage.CNA.WindowsService services, again via
DLL search-order hijacking because unprivileged users would have
modify permissions on the application directory. Note that while older
versions of the software default to installing in %PROGRAMFILES(X86)%
(which would allow the Sage folder to inherit strong permissions,
making the installation not vulnerable), the official Sage 300
installation guides for those versions recommend installing in
C:\Sage, which would make the installation vulnerable.

** DISPUTED ** Dnsmasq 2.86 has a heap-based buffer overflow in
resize_packet (called from FuzzResizePacket and fuzz_rfc1035.c)
because of the lack of a proper bounds check upon pseudo header re-
insertion. NOTE: the vendor's position is that CVE-2021-45951 through
CVE-2021-45957 "do not represent real vulnerabilities, to the best of
our knowledge." However, a contributor states that a security patch
(mentioned in 016162.html) is needed.

An access control issue in the authentication module of Lexar_F35
v1.0.34 allows attackers to access sensitive data and cause a Denial
of Service (DoS). An attacker without access to securely protected
data on a secure USB flash drive can bypass user authentication
without having any information related to the password of the
registered user. The secure USB flash drive transmits the password
entered by the user to the authentication module in the drive after
the user registers a password, and then the input password is compared
with the registered password stored in the authentication module.
Subsequently, the module returns the comparison result for the
authentication decision. Therefore, an attacker can bypass password
authentication by analyzing the functions that return the password
verification or comparison results and manipulate the authentication
result values. Accordingly, even if attackers enter an incorrect
password, they can be authenticated as a legitimate user and can
therefore exploit functions of the secure USB flash drive by
manipulating the authentication result values.

An issue was discovered in Treasure Data Fluent Bit 1.7.1, erroneous
parsing in flb_pack_msgpack_to_json_format leads to type confusion bug
that interprets whatever is on the stack as msgpack maps and arrays,
leading to use-after-free. This can be used by an attacker to craft a
specially craft file and trick the victim opening it using the affect
software, triggering use-after-free and execute arbitrary code on the
target system.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net: hso: fix null-ptr-deref during tty device unregistration Multiple
ttys try to claim the same the minor number causing a double
unregistration of the same device. The first unregistration succeeds
but the next one results in a null-ptr-deref. The
get_free_serial_index() function returns an available minor number but
doesn't assign it immediately. The assignment is done by the caller
later. But before this assignment, calls to get_free_serial_index()
would return the same minor number. Fix this by modifying
get_free_serial_index to assign the minor number immediately after one
is found to be and rename it to obtain_minor() to better reflect what
it does. Similary, rename set_serial_by_index() to release_minor() and
modify it to free up the minor number of the given hso_serial. Every
obtain_minor() should have corresponding release_minor() call.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
HID: usbhid: fix info leak in hid_submit_ctrl In hid_submit_ctrl(),
the way of calculating the report length doesn't take into account
that report->size can be zero. When running the syzkaller reproducer,
a report of size 0 causes hid_submit_ctrl) to calculate
transfer_buffer_length as 16384. When this urb is passed to the usb
core layer, KMSAN reports an info leak of 16384 bytes. To fix this,
first modify hid_report_len() to account for the zero report size case
by using DIV_ROUND_UP for the division. Then, call it from
hid_submit_ctrl().

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ARM: footbridge: fix PCI interrupt mapping Since commit 30fdfb929e82
("PCI: Add a call to pci_assign_irq() in pci_device_probe()"), the PCI
code will call the IRQ mapping function whenever a PCI driver is
probed. If these are marked as __init, this causes an oops if a PCI
driver is loaded or bound after the kernel has initialised.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ARM: 9063/1: mm: reduce maximum number of CPUs if DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL is
enabled The debugging code for kmap_local() doubles the number of per-
CPU fixmap slots allocated for kmap_local(), in order to use half of
them as guard regions. This causes the fixmap region to grow downwards
beyond the start of its reserved window if the supported number of
CPUs is large, and collide with the newly added virtual DT mapping
right below it, which is obviously not good. One manifestation of this
is EFI boot on a kernel built with NR_CPUS=32 and
CONFIG_DEBUG_KMAP_LOCAL=y, which may pass the FDT in highmem,
resulting in block entries below the fixmap region that the fixmap
code misidentifies as fixmap table entries, and subsequently tries to
dereference using a phys-to-virt translation that is only valid for
lowmem. This results in a cryptic splat such as the one below. ftrace:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net: Make tcp_allowed_congestion_control readonly in non-init netns
Currently, tcp_allowed_congestion_control is global and writable;
writing to it in any net namespace will leak into all other net
namespaces. tcp_available_congestion_control and
tcp_allowed_congestion_control are the only sysctls in ipv4_net_table
(the per-netns sysctl table) with a NULL data pointer; their handlers
(proc_tcp_available_congestion_control and
proc_allowed_congestion_control) have no other way of referencing a
struct net. Thus, they operate globally. Because ipv4_net_table does
not use designated initializers, there is no easy way to fix up this
one "bad" table entry. However, the data pointer updating logic
shouldn't be applied to NULL pointers anyway, so we instead force
these entries to be read-only. These sysctls used to exist in
ipv4_table (init-net only), but they were moved to the per-net
ipv4_net_table, presumably without realizing that
tcp_allowed_congestion_control was writable and thus introduced a
leak. Because the intent of that commit was only to know (i.e. read)
"which congestion algorithms are available or allowed", this read-only
solution should be sufficient. The logic added in recent commit
31c4d2f160eb: ("net: Ensure net namespace isolation of sysctls") does
not and cannot check for NULL data pointers, because other table
entries (e.g. /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_log/) have .data=NULL but use
other methods (.extra2) to access the struct net.

ixgbe: Fix NULL pointer dereference in ethtool loopback test The ixgbe
driver currently generates a NULL pointer dereference when performing
the ethtool loopback test. This is due to the fact that there isn't a
q_vector associated with the test ring when it is setup as interrupts
are not normally added to the test rings. To address this I have added
code that will check for a q_vector before returning a napi_id value.
If a q_vector is not present it will return a value of 0.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
locking/qrwlock: Fix ordering in queued_write_lock_slowpath() While
this code is executed with the wait_lock held, a reader can acquire
the lock without holding wait_lock. The writer side loops checking the
value with the atomic_cond_read_acquire(), but only truly acquires the
lock when the compare-and-exchange is completed successfully which
isn&#8217;t ordered. This exposes the window between the acquire and the
cmpxchg to an A-B-A problem which allows reads following the lock
acquisition to observe values speculatively before the write lock is
truly acquired. We've seen a problem in epoll where the reader does a
xchg while holding the read lock, but the writer can see a value
change out from under it. Writer | Reader ----------------------------
----------------------------------------------------
ep_scan_ready_list() | |- write_lock_irq() | |-
queued_write_lock_slowpath() | |- atomic_cond_read_acquire() | |
read_lock_irqsave(&ep->lock, flags); --> (observes value before
unlock) | chain_epi_lockless() | | epi->next = xchg(&ep->ovflist,
epi); | | read_unlock_irqrestore(&ep->lock, flags); | | |
atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed() | |-- READ_ONCE(ep->ovflist); | A core can
order the read of the ovflist ahead of the atomic_cmpxchg_relaxed().
Switching the cmpxchg to use acquire semantics addresses this issue at
which point the atomic_cond_read can be switched to use relaxed
semantics. [peterz: use try_cmpxchg()]

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
KEYS: trusted: Fix TPM reservation for seal/unseal The original patch
8c657a0590de ("KEYS: trusted: Reserve TPM for seal and unseal
operations") was correct on the mailing list:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-
integrity/20210128235621.127925-4-jarkko@kernel.org/ But somehow got
rebased so that the tpm_try_get_ops() in tpm2_seal_trusted() got lost.
This causes an imbalanced put of the TPM ops and causes oopses on TIS
based hardware. This fix puts back the lost tpm_try_get_ops()

when the link is going to be destroyed, smcr_link_clear() will reset

the CQ. To make sure all the CQEs will always come back so the

smc_ib_modify_qp_reset() was replaced by smc_ib_modify_qp_error(). And
remove the timeout in smc_wr_tx_wait_no_pending_sends() since we need

when handling CQEs. For IB device removal routine, we need to wait for
all the QPs on that device been destroyed before we can destroy CQs on
the device, or the refcount on smc_connection won't reach 0 and
smc_sock cannot be released.

parisc: Clear stale IIR value on instruction access rights trap When a
trap 7 (Instruction access rights) occurs, this means the CPU couldn't
execute an instruction due to missing execute permissions on the
memory region. In this case it seems the CPU didn't even fetched the
instruction from memory and thus did not store it in the cr19 (IIR)
register before calling the trap handler. So, the trap handler will
find some random old stale value in cr19. This patch simply overwrites
the stale IIR value with a constant magic "bad food" value
(0xbaadf00d), in the hope people don't start to try to understand the
various random IIR values in trap 7 dumps.

sock_diag_rcv+0x2a/0x40 net/core/sock_diag.c:274 This issue occurs
when asoc is peeled off and the old sk is freed after getting it by
asoc->base.sk and before calling lock_sock(sk). To prevent the sk
free, as a holder of the sk, ep should be alive when calling
lock_sock(). This patch uses call_rcu() and moves sock_put and ep free
into sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), so that it's safe to try to hold the
ep under rcu_read_lock in sctp_transport_traverse_process(). If
sctp_endpoint_hold() returns true, it means this ep is still alive and
we have held it and can continue to dump it; If it returns false, it
means this ep is dead and can be freed after rcu_read_unlock, and we
should skip it. In sctp_sock_dump(), after locking the sk, if this ep
is different from tsp->asoc->ep, it means during this dumping, this
asoc was peeled off before calling lock_sock(), and the sk should be
skipped; If this ep is the same with tsp->asoc->ep, it means no
peeloff happens on this asoc, and due to lock_sock, no peeloff will
happen either until release_sock. Note that delaying endpoint free
won't delay the port release, as the port release happens in
sctp_endpoint_destroy() before calling call_rcu(). Also, freeing
endpoint by call_rcu() makes it safe to access the sk by asoc->base.sk
in sctp_assocs_seq_show() and sctp_rcv(). Thanks Jones to bring this
issue up. v1->v2: - improve the changelog. - add kfree(ep) into
sctp_endpoint_destroy_rcu(), as Jakub noticed.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
Input: appletouch - initialize work before device registration Syzbot
has reported warning in __flush_work(). This warning is caused by
work->func == NULL, which means missing work initialization. This may
happen, since input_dev->close() calls cancel_work_sync(&dev->work),
but dev->work initalization happens _after_ input_register_device()
call. So this patch moves dev->work initialization before registering
input device

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
usb: gadget: f_fs: Clear ffs_eventfd in ffs_data_clear. ffs_data_clear
is indirectly called from both ffs_fs_kill_sb and ffs_ep0_release, so
it ends up being called twice when userland closes ep0 and then
unmounts f_fs. If userland provided an eventfd along with function's
USB descriptors, it ends up calling eventfd_ctx_put as many times,
causing a refcount underflow. NULL-ify ffs_eventfd to prevent these
extraneous eventfd_ctx_put calls. Also, set epfiles to NULL right
after de-allocating it, for readability. For completeness,
ffs_data_clear actually ends up being called thrice, the last call
being before the whole ffs structure gets freed, so when this specific
sequence happens there is a second underflow happening (but not being
reported): /sys/kernel/debug/tracing# modprobe usb_f_fs
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing# echo ffs_data_clear > set_ftrace_filter
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing# echo function > current_tracer

i2c: validate user data in compat ioctl Wrong user data may cause
warning in i2c_transfer(), ex: zero msgs. Userspace should not be able
to trigger warnings, so this patch adds validation checks for user

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
binder: fix async_free_space accounting for empty parcels In 4.13,
commit 74310e06be4d ("android: binder: Move buffer out of area shared
with user space") fixed a kernel structure visibility issue. As part
of that patch, sizeof(void *) was used as the buffer size for 0-length
data payloads so the driver could detect abusive clients sending
0-length asynchronous transactions to a server by enforcing limits on
async_free_size. Unfortunately, on the "free" side, the accounting of
async_free_space did not add the sizeof(void *) back. The result was
that up to 8-bytes of async_free_space were leaked on every async
transaction of 8-bytes or less. These small transactions are uncommon,
so this accounting issue has gone undetected for several years. The
fix is to use "buffer_size" (the allocated buffer size) instead of
"size" (the logical buffer size) when updating the async_free_space
during the free operation. These are the same except for this corner
case of asynchronous transactions with payloads < 8 bytes.

issue was also reported since 2017 in the thread [1], unfortunately,
the issue was still can be reproduced after fixing DCCP. The
ipv4_mib_exit_net is called before tcp_sk_exit_batch when a net
namespace is destroyed since tcp_sk_ops is registered befrore
ipv4_mib_ops, which means tcp_sk_ops is in the front of ipv4_mib_ops
in the list of pernet_list. There will be a use-after-free on
net->mib.net_statistics in tw_timer_handler after ipv4_mib_exit_net if
there are some inflight time-wait timers. This bug is not introduced
by commit f2bf415cfed7 ("mib: add net to NET_ADD_STATS_BH") since the
net_statistics is a global variable instead of dynamic allocation and
freeing. Actually, commit 61a7e26028b9 ("mib: put net statistics on
struct net") introduces the bug since it put net statistics on struct
net and free it when net namespace is destroyed. Moving
init_ipv4_mibs() to the front of tcp_init() to fix this bug and
replace pr_crit() with panic() since continuing is meaningless when
init_ipv4_mibs() fails. [1]

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
mm/damon/dbgfs: fix 'struct pid' leaks in 'dbgfs_target_ids_write()'
DAMON debugfs interface increases the reference counts of 'struct
pid's for targets from the 'target_ids' file write callback
('dbgfs_target_ids_write()'), but decreases the counts only in DAMON
monitoring termination callback ('dbgfs_before_terminate()').
Therefore, when 'target_ids' file is repeatedly written without DAMON
monitoring start/termination, the reference count is not decreased and
therefore memory for the 'struct pid' cannot be freed. This commit
fixes this issue by decreasing the reference counts when 'target_ids'
is written.

With the following RIP: RIP:
0010:native_queued_spin_lock_slowpath+0x69/0x200 Since the fix to the
recursion detection would allow a single recursion to happen while
tracing, this lead to the trace_clock_global() taking a spin lock and
then trying to take it again: ring_buffer_lock_reserve() {
trace_clock_global() { arch_spin_lock() { queued_spin_lock_slowpath()
{ /* lock taken */ (something else gets traced by function graph
tracer) ring_buffer_lock_reserve() { trace_clock_global() {
arch_spin_lock() { queued_spin_lock_slowpath() { /* DEAD LOCK! */
Tracing should *never* block, as it can lead to strange lockups like
the above. Restructure the trace_clock_global() code to instead of
simply taking a lock to update the recorded "prev_time" simply use it,
as two events happening on two different CPUs that calls this at the
same time, really doesn't matter which one goes first. Use a trylock
to grab the lock for updating the prev_time, and if it fails, simply
try again the next time. If it failed to be taken, that means
something else is already updating it. Bugzilla:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
tools/power turbostat: Fix offset overflow issue in index converting
The idx_to_offset() function returns type int (32-bit signed), but
MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STAT is u32 and would be interpreted as a negative
number. The end result is that it hits the if (offset < 0) check in
update_msr_sum() which prevents the timer callback from updating the
stat in the background when long durations are used. The similar issue
exists in offset_to_idx() and update_msr_sum(). Fix this issue by
converting the 'int' to 'off_t' accordingly.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
usb: dwc3: core: Do core softreset when switch mode According to the
programming guide, to switch mode for DRD controller, the driver needs
to do the following. To switch from device to host: 1. Reset
controller with GCTL.CoreSoftReset 2. Set GCTL.PrtCapDir(host mode) 3.
Reset the host with USBCMD.HCRESET 4. Then follow up with the
initializing host registers sequence To switch from host to device: 1.
Reset controller with GCTL.CoreSoftReset 2. Set GCTL.PrtCapDir(device
mode) 3. Reset the device with DCTL.CSftRst 4. Then follow up with the
initializing registers sequence Currently we're missing step 1) to do
GCTL.CoreSoftReset and step 3) of switching from host to device. John
Stult reported a lockup issue seen with HiKey960 platform without
these steps[1]. Similar issue is observed with Ferry's testing
platform[2]. So, apply the required steps along with some fixes to Yu
Chen's and John Stultz's version. The main fixes to their versions are
the missing wait for clocks synchronization before clearing
GCTL.CoreSoftReset and only apply DCTL.CSftRst when switching from
host to device. [1] https://lore.kernel.org/linux-

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
io_uring: fix shared sqpoll cancellation hangs [ 736.982891] INFO:

736.982897] Call Trace: [ 736.982901] schedule+0x68/0xe0 [ 736.982903]

We call io_uring_cancel_sqpoll() one by one for each ctx either in
sq_thread() itself or via task works, and it's intended to cancel all
requests of a specified context. However the function uses per-task
counters to track the number of inflight requests, so it counts more
requests than available via currect io_uring ctx and goes to sleep for
them to appear (e.g. from IRQ), that will never happen. Cancel a bit
more than before, i.e. all ctxs that share sqpoll and continue to use
shared counters. Don't forget that we should not remove ctx from the
list before running that task_work sqpoll-cancel, otherwise the
function wouldn't be able to find the context and will hang.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ext4: always panic when errors=panic is specified Before commit
014c9caa29d3 ("ext4: make ext4_abort() use __ext4_error()"), the
following series of commands would trigger a panic: 1. mount /dev/sda
-o ro,errors=panic test 2. mount /dev/sda -o remount,abort test After
commit 014c9caa29d3, remounting a file system using the test mount
option "abort" will no longer trigger a panic. This commit will
restore the behaviour immediately before commit 014c9caa29d3.
(However, note that the Linux kernel's behavior has not been
consistent; some previous kernel versions, including 5.4 and 4.19
similarly did not panic after using the mount option "abort".) This
also makes a change to long-standing behaviour; namely, the following
series commands will now cause a panic, when previously it did not: 1.
mount /dev/sda -o ro,errors=panic test 2. echo test >
/sys/fs/ext4/sda/trigger_fs_error However, this makes ext4's behaviour
much more consistent, so this is a good thing.

tpm_read_log_efi is called multiple times, which happens when one

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
NFS: fs_context: validate UDP retrans to prevent shift out-of-bounds
Fix shift out-of-bounds in xprt_calc_majortimeo(). This is caused by a
garbage timeout (retrans) mount option being passed to nfs mount, in
this case from syzkaller. If the protocol is XPRT_TRANSPORT_UDP, then
'retrans' is a shift value for a 64-bit long integer, so 'retrans'
cannot be >= 64. If it is >= 64, fail the mount and return an error.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ACPI: GTDT: Don't corrupt interrupt mappings on watchdow probe failure
When failing the driver probe because of invalid firmware properties,
the GTDT driver unmaps the interrupt that it mapped earlier. However,
it never checks whether the mapping of the interrupt actially
succeeded. Even more, should the firmware report an illegal interrupt
number that overlaps with the GIC SGI range, this can result in an IPI
being unmapped, and subsequent fireworks (as reported by Dann
Frazier). Rework the driver to have a slightly saner behaviour and
actually check whether the interrupt has been mapped before unmapping
things.

/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/trace Here's what happens to hit that
BUG_ON(): 1) After installing kprobe at entry of sys_read, the first
instruction is replaced by 'ebreak' instruction on riscv64 platform.
2) Once kernel reach the 'ebreak' instruction at the entry of
sys_read, it trap into the riscv breakpoint handler, where it do
something to setup for coming single-step of origin instruction,
including backup the 'sstatus' in pt_regs, followed by disable
interrupt during single stepping via clear 'SIE' bit of 'sstatus' in
pt_regs. 3) Then kernel restore to the instruction slot contains two
instructions, one is original instruction at entry of sys_read, the
other is 'ebreak'. Here it trigger a 'Instruction page fault'
exception (value at 'scause' is '0xc'), if PF is not filled into
PageTabe for that slot yet. 4) Again kernel trap into page fault
exception handler, where it choose different policy according to the
state of running kprobe. Because afte 2) the state is KPROBE_HIT_SS,
so kernel reset the current kp ---truncated---

Limit: none which is cause by a 'BUG_ON(in_nmi())' in nmi_enter().
From the call trace, we can find three interrupts (noted A, B, C
above): interrupt (A) is preempted by (B), which is further
interrupted by (C). Subsequent investigations show that (B) results in
nmi_enter() being called, but that it actually is a spurious
interrupt. Furthermore, interrupts are reenabled in the context of
(B), and (C) fires with NMI priority. We end-up with a nested NMI
situation, something we definitely do not want to (and cannot) handle.
The bug here is that spurious interrupts should never result in any
state change, and we should just return to the interrupted context.
Moving the handling of spurious interrupts as early as possible in the
GICv3 handler fixes this issue. [maz: rewrote commit message,

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
mmc: uniphier-sd: Fix a resource leak in the remove function A
'tmio_mmc_host_free()' call is missing in the remove function, in
order to balance a 'tmio_mmc_host_alloc()' call in the probe. This is
done in the error handling path of the probe, but not in the remove
function. Add the missing call.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
scsi: qla2xxx: Reserve extra IRQ vectors Commit a6dcfe08487e ("scsi:
qla2xxx: Limit interrupt vectors to number of CPUs") lowers the number
of allocated MSI-X vectors to the number of CPUs. That breaks vector
allocation assumptions in qla83xx_iospace_config(),
qla24xx_enable_msix() and qla2x00_iospace_config(). Either of the
functions computes maximum number of qpairs as: ha->max_qpairs =
ha->msix_count - 1 (MB interrupt) - 1 (default response queue) - 1
(ATIO, in dual or pure target mode) max_qpairs is set to zero in case
of two CPUs and initiator mode. The number is then used to allocate
ha->queue_pair_map inside qla2x00_alloc_queues(). No allocation
happens and ha->queue_pair_map is left NULL but the driver thinks
there are queue pairs available. qla2xxx_queuecommand() tries to find
a qpair in the map and crashes: if (ha->mqenable) { uint32_t tag;
uint16_t hwq; struct qla_qpair *qpair = NULL; tag =
blk_mq_unique_tag(cmd->request); hwq = blk_mq_unique_tag_to_hwq(tag);

The driver should allocate enough vectors to provide every CPU it's
own HW queue and still handle reserved (MB, RSP, ATIO) interrupts. The
change fixes the crash on dual core VM and prevents unbalanced QP
allocation where nr_hw_queues is two less than the number of CPUs.

ACPI: custom_method: fix potential use-after-free issue In cm_write(),
buf is always freed when reaching the end of the function. If the
requested count is less than table.length, the allocated buffer will
be freed but subsequent calls to cm_write() will still try to access
it. Remove the unconditional kfree(buf) at the end of the function and
set the buf to NULL in the -EINVAL error path to match the rest of
function.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
vhost-vdpa: fix vm_flags for virtqueue doorbell mapping The virtqueue
doorbell is usually implemented via registeres but we don't provide
the necessary vma->flags like VM_PFNMAP. This may cause several issues
e.g when userspace tries to map the doorbell via vhost IOTLB, kernel
may panic due to the page is not backed by page structure. This patch
fixes this by setting the necessary vm_flags. With this patch, try to
map doorbell via IOTLB will fail with bad address.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
s390/zcrypt: fix zcard and zqueue hot-unplug memleak Tests with kvm
and a kmemdebug kernel showed, that on hot unplug the zcard and zqueue
structs for the unplugged card or queue are not properly freed because
of a mismatch with get/put for the embedded kref counter. This fix now
adjusts the handling of the kref counters. With init the kref counter
starts with 1. This initial value needs to drop to zero with the
unregister of the card or queue to trigger the release and free the
object.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
bus: mhi: core: Fix invalid error returning in mhi_queue mhi_queue
returns an error when the doorbell is not accessible in the current
state. This can happen when the device is in non M0 state, like M3,
and needs to be waken-up prior ringing the DB. This case is managed
earlier by triggering an asynchronous M3 exit via controller
resume/suspend callbacks, that in turn will cause M0 transition and DB
update. So, since it's not an error but just delaying of doorbell
update, there is no reason to return an error. This also fixes a use
after free error for skb case, indeed a caller queuing skb will try to
free the skb if the queueing fails, but in that case queueing has been
done.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

A recent change created a dedicated workqueue for the state-change
work with WQ_HIGHPRI (no strong reason for that) and WQ_MEM_RECLAIM
flags, but the state-change work (mhi_pm_st_worker) does not guarantee
forward progress under memory pressure, and will even wait on various

this causes a warning in check_flush_dependency() since we end up in

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
perf/core: Fix unconditional security_locked_down() call Currently,
the lockdown state is queried unconditionally, even though its result
is used only if the PERF_SAMPLE_REGS_INTR bit is set in
attr.sample_type. While that doesn't matter in case of the Lockdown
LSM, it causes trouble with the SELinux's lockdown hook
implementation. SELinux implements the locked_down hook with a check
whether the current task's type has the corresponding "lockdown" class
permission ("integrity" or "confidentiality") allowed in the policy.
This means that calling the hook when the access control decision
would be ignored generates a bogus permission check and audit record.
Fix this by checking sample_type first and only calling the hook when
its result would be honored.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net: qrtr: Avoid potential use after free in MHI send It is possible
that the MHI ul_callback will be invoked immediately following the
queueing of the skb for transmission, leading to the callback
decrementing the refcount of the associated sk and freeing the skb. As
such the dereference of skb and the increment of the sk refcount must
happen before the skb is queued, to avoid the skb to be used after
free and potentially the sk to drop its last refcount..

unconditionally into AX from the off_reg, then move the pointer from
the src to dst and finally use AX as the source for the original
pointer arithmetic operation such that the inversion yields a correct
result. The single non-AX mov in between is possible given constant

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
KVM: VMX: Disable preemption when probing user return MSRs Disable
preemption when probing a user return MSR via RDSMR/WRMSR. If the MSR
holds a different value per logical CPU, the WRMSR could corrupt the
host's value if KVM is preempted between the RDMSR and WRMSR, and then
rescheduled on a different CPU. Opportunistically land the helper in
common x86, SVM will use the helper in a future commit.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
KVM: nVMX: Always make an attempt to map eVMCS after migration When
enlightened VMCS is in use and nested state is migrated with
vmx_get_nested_state()/vmx_set_nested_state() KVM can't map evmcs page
right away: evmcs gpa is not 'struct kvm_vmx_nested_state_hdr' and we
can't read it from VP assist page because userspace may decide to
restore HV_X64_MSR_VP_ASSIST_PAGE after restoring nested state (and
QEMU, for example, does exactly that). To make sure eVMCS is mapped
/vmx_set_nested_state() raises KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES request.
Commit f2c7ef3ba955 ("KVM: nSVM: cancel KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES
on nested vmexit") added KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES clearing to
nested_vmx_vmexit() to make sure MSR permission bitmap is not switched
when an immediate exit from L2 to L1 happens right after migration
(caused by a pending event, for example). Unfortunately, in the exact
same situation we still need to have eVMCS mapped so
nested_sync_vmcs12_to_shadow() reflects changes in VMCS12 to eVMCS. As
a band-aid, restore nested_get_evmcs_page() when clearing
KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES in nested_vmx_vmexit(). The 'fix' is
far from being ideal as we can't easily propagate possible failures
and even if we could, this is most likely already too late to do so.
The whole 'KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES' idea for mapping eVMCS
after migration seems to be fragile as we diverge too much from the
'native' path when vmptr loading happens on vmx_set_nested_state().

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
iio: core: fix ioctl handlers removal Currently ioctl handlers are
removed twice. For the first time during iio_device_unregister() then
later on inside iio_device_unregister_eventset() and
iio_buffers_free_sysfs_and_mask(). Double free leads to kernel panic.
Fix this by not touching ioctl handlers list directly but rather
letting code responsible for registration call the matching cleanup
routine itself.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
usb: typec: ucsi: Retrieve all the PDOs instead of just the first 4
commit 4dbc6a4ef06d ("usb: typec: ucsi: save power data objects in PD
mode") introduced retrieval of the PDOs when connected to a PD-capable
source. But only the first 4 PDOs are received since that is the
maximum number that can be fetched at a time given the MESSAGE_IN
length limitation (16 bytes). However, as per the PD spec a connected
source may advertise up to a maximum of 7 PDOs. If such a source is
connected it's possible the PPM could have negotiated a power contract
with one of the PDOs at index greater than 4, and would be reflected
in the request data object's (RDO) object position field. This would
result in an out-of-bounds access when the rdo_index() is used to
index into the src_pdos array in ucsi_psy_get_voltage_now(). With the
help of the UBSAN -fsanitize=array-bounds checker enabled this exact
issue is revealed when connecting to a PD source adapter that
advertise 5 PDOs and the PPM enters a contract having selected the 5th
one. [ 151.545106][ T70] Unexpected kernel BRK exception at EL1 [

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
kyber: fix out of bounds access when preempted
__blk_mq_sched_bio_merge() gets the ctx and hctx for the current CPU
and passes the hctx to ->bio_merge(). kyber_bio_merge() then gets the
ctx for the current CPU again and uses that to get the corresponding
Kyber context in the passed hctx. However, the thread may be preempted
between the two calls to blk_mq_get_ctx(), and the ctx returned the
second time may no longer correspond to the passed hctx. This "works"
accidentally most of the time, but it can cause us to read garbage if
the second ctx came from an hctx with more ctx's than the first one
(i.e., if ctx->index_hw[hctx->type] > hctx->nr_ctx). This manifested
as this UBSAN array index out of bounds error reported by Jakub:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
usb: dwc3: gadget: Free gadget structure only after freeing endpoints
As part of commit e81a7018d93a ("usb: dwc3: allocate gadget structure
dynamically") the dwc3_gadget_release() was added which will free the
dwc->gadget structure upon the device's removal when
usb_del_gadget_udc() is called in dwc3_gadget_exit(). However, simply
freeing the gadget results a dangling pointer situation: the endpoints
created in dwc3_gadget_init_endpoints() have their
dep->endpoint.ep_list members chained off the list_head anchored at
dwc->gadget->ep_list. Thus when dwc->gadget is freed, the first
dwc3_ep in the list now has a dangling prev pointer and likewise for
the next pointer of the dwc3_ep at the tail of the list. The
dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() that follows will result in a use-after-
free when it calls list_del(). This was caught by enabling KASAN and
performing a driver unbind. The recent commit 568262bf5492 ("usb:
dwc3: core: Add shutdown callback for dwc3") also exposes this as a
panic during shutdown. There are a few possibilities to fix this. One
could be to perform a list_del() of the gadget->ep_list itself which
removes it from the rest of the dwc3_ep chain. Another approach is
what this patch does, by splitting up the usb_del_gadget_udc() call
into its separate "del" and "put" components. This allows
dwc3_gadget_free_endpoints() to be called before the gadget is finally
freed with usb_put_gadget().

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
btrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extents and using qgroups
There are a few exceptional cases where cloning an inline extent needs
to copy the inline extent data into a page of the destination inode.
When this happens, we end up starting a transaction while having a
dirty page for the destination inode and while having the range locked
in the destination's inode iotree too. Because when reserving metadata
space for a transaction we may need to flush existing delalloc in case
there is not enough free space, we have a mechanism in place to
prevent a deadlock, which was introduced in commit 3d45f221ce627d
("btrfs: fix deadlock when cloning inline extent and low on free
metadata space"). However when using qgroups, a transaction also
reserves metadata qgroup space, which can also result in flushing
delalloc in case there is not enough available space at the moment.
When this happens we deadlock, since flushing delalloc requires
locking the file range in the inode's iotree and the range was already
locked at the very beginning of the clone operation, before attempting
to start the transaction. When this issue happens, stack traces like
the following are reported: [72747.556262] task:kworker/u81:9 state:D

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
userfaultfd: release page in error path to avoid BUG_ON Consider the
following sequence of events: 1. Userspace issues a UFFD ioctl, which
ends up calling into shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). We successfully account
the blocks, we shmem_alloc_page(), but then the copy_from_user()
fails. We return -ENOENT. We don't release the page we allocated. 2.
Our caller detects this error code, tries the copy_from_user() after
dropping the mmap_lock, and retries, calling back into
shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). 3. Meanwhile, let's say another process
filled up the tmpfs being used. 4. So shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() fails
to account blocks this time, and immediately returns - without
releasing the page. This triggers a BUG_ON in our caller, which
asserts that the page should always be consumed, unless -ENOENT is
returned. To fix this, detect if we have such a "dangling" page when
accounting fails, and if so, release it before returning.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
hfsplus: prevent corruption in shrinking truncate I believe there are
some issues introduced by commit 31651c607151 ("hfsplus: avoid
deadlock on file truncation") HFS+ has extent records which always
contains 8 extents. In case the first extent record in catalog file
gets full, new ones are allocated from extents overflow file. In case
shrinking truncate happens to middle of an extent record which locates
in extents overflow file, the logic in hfsplus_file_truncate() was
changed so that call to hfs_brec_remove() is not guarded any more.
Right action would be just freeing the extents that exceed the new
size inside extent record by calling hfsplus_free_extents(), and then
check if the whole extent record should be removed. However since the
guard (blk_cnt > start) is now after the call to hfs_brec_remove(),
this has unfortunate effect that the last matching extent record is
removed unconditionally. To reproduce this issue, create a file which
has at least 10 extents, and then perform shrinking truncate into
middle of the last extent record, so that the number of remaining
extents is not under or divisible by 8. This causes the last extent
record (8 extents) to be removed totally instead of truncating into
middle of it. Thus this causes corruption, and lost data. Fix for this
is simply checking if the new truncated end is below the start of this
extent record, making it safe to remove the full extent record.
However call to hfs_brec_remove() can't be moved to it's previous
place since we're dropping ->tree_lock and it can cause a race
condition and the cached info being invalidated possibly corrupting
the node data. Another issue is related to this one. When entering
into the block (blk_cnt > start) we are not holding the ->tree_lock.
We break out from the loop not holding the lock, but hfs_find_exit()
does unlock it. Not sure if it's possible for someone else to take the
lock under our feet, but it can cause hard to debug errors and
premature unlocking. Even if there's no real risk of it, the locking
should still always be kept in balance. Thus taking the lock now just
before the check.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
powerpc/64s: Fix crashes when toggling entry flush barrier The entry
flush mitigation can be enabled/disabled at runtime via a debugfs file
(entry_flush), which causes the kernel to patch itself to
enable/disable the relevant mitigations. However depending on which
mitigation we're using, it may not be safe to do that patching while
other CPUs are active. For example the following crash:
sleeper[15639]: segfault (11) at c000000000004c20 nip c000000000004c20
lr c000000000004c20 Shows that we returned to userspace with a
corrupted LR that points into the kernel, due to executing the
partially patched call to the fallback entry flush (ie. we missed the
LR restore). Fix it by doing the patching under stop machine. The CPUs
that aren't doing the patching will be spinning in the core of the
stop machine logic. That is currently sufficient for our purposes,
because none of the patching we do is to that code or anywhere in the
vicinity.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
sched: Fix out-of-bound access in uclamp Util-clamp places tasks in
different buckets based on their clamp values for performance reasons.
However, the size of buckets is currently computed using a rounding
division, which can lead to an off-by-one error in some
configurations. For instance, with 20 buckets, the bucket size will be
1024/20=51. A task with a clamp of 1024 will be mapped to bucket id
1024/51=20. Sadly, correct indexes are in range [0,19], hence leading
to an out of bound memory access. Clamp the bucket id to fix the
issue.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
arm64: entry: always set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during entry Zenghui
reports that booting a kernel with "irqchip.gicv3_pseudo_nmi=1" on the
command line hits a warning during kernel entry, due to the way we
manipulate the PMR. Early in the entry sequence, we call
lockdep_hardirqs_off() to inform lockdep that interrupts have been
masked (as the HW sets DAIF wqhen entering an exception).
Architecturally PMR_EL1 is not affected by exception entry, and we
don't set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in the PMR early in the exception entry
sequence, so early in exception entry the PMR can indicate that
interrupts are unmasked even though they are masked by DAIF. If
DEBUG_LOCKDEP is selected, lockdep_hardirqs_off() will check that
interrupts are masked, before we set GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET in any of the
exception entry paths, and hence lockdep_hardirqs_off() will WARN()
that something is amiss. We can avoid this by consistently setting
GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET during exception entry so that kernel code sees a
consistent environment. We must also update local_daif_inherit() to
undo this, as currently only touches DAIF. For other paths,
local_daif_restore() will update both DAIF and the PMR. With this
done, we can remove the existing special cases which set this later in
the entry code. We always use (GIC_PRIO_IRQON | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET)
for consistency with local_daif_save(), as this will warn if it ever
encounters (GIC_PRIO_IRQOFF | GIC_PRIO_PSR_I_SET), and never sets this
itself. This matches the gic_prio_kentry_setup that we have to retain
for ret_to_user. The original splat from Zenghui's report was: |

ethernet:enic: Fix a use after free bug in enic_hard_start_xmit In
enic_hard_start_xmit, it calls enic_queue_wq_skb(). Inside
enic_queue_wq_skb, if some error happens, the skb will be freed by
dev_kfree_skb(skb). But the freed skb is still used in
skb_tx_timestamp(skb). My patch makes enic_queue_wq_skb() return error
and goto spin_unlock() incase of error. The solution is provided by
Govind. See https://lkml.org/lkml/2021/4/30/961.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
sctp: do asoc update earlier in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a There's a panic
that occurs in a few of envs, the call trace is as below: [] general
protection fault, ... 0x29acd70f1000a: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI [] RIP:

sctp_do_sm+0xc3/0x2a0 [sctp] [] sctp_generate_timeout_event+0x81/0xf0
[sctp] This is caused by a transport use-after-free issue. When
processing a duplicate COOKIE-ECHO chunk in sctp_sf_do_dupcook_a(),
both COOKIE-ACK and SHUTDOWN chunks are allocated with the transort
from the new asoc. However, later in the sideeffect machine, the old
asoc is used to send them out and old asoc's shutdown_last_sent_to is
set to the transport that SHUTDOWN chunk attached to in
sctp_cmd_setup_t2(), which actually belongs to the new asoc. After the
new_asoc is freed and the old asoc T2 timeout, the old asoc's
shutdown_last_sent_to that is already freed would be accessed in
sctp_sf_t2_timer_expire(). Thanks Alexander and Jere for helping dig
into this issue. To fix it, this patch is to do the asoc update first,
then allocate the COOKIE-ACK and SHUTDOWN chunks with the 'updated'
old asoc. This would make more sense, as a chunk from an asoc
shouldn't be sent out with another asoc. We had fixed quite a few
issues caused by this.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
xprtrdma: Fix cwnd update ordering After a reconnect, the reply
handler is opening the cwnd (and thus enabling more RPC Calls to be
sent) /before/ rpcrdma_post_recvs() can post enough Receive WRs to
receive their replies. This causes an RNR and the new connection is
lost immediately. The race is most clearly exposed when KASAN and
disconnect injection are enabled. This slows down rpcrdma_rep_create()
enough to allow the send side to post a bunch of RPC Calls before the
Receive completion handler can invoke ib_post_recv().

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
f2fs: fix to avoid touching checkpointed data in get_victim() In CP
disabling mode, there are two issues when using LFS or SSR | AT_SSR
mode to select victim: 1. LFS is set to find source section during GC,
the victim should have no checkpointed data, since after GC, section
could not be set free for reuse. Previously, we only check valid chpt
blocks in current segment rather than section, fix it. 2. SSR | AT_SSR
are set to find target segment for writes which can be fully filled by
checkpointed and newly written blocks, we should never select such
segment, otherwise it can cause panic or data corruption during
allocation, potential case is described as below: a) target segment
has 'n' (n < 512) ckpt valid blocks b) GC migrates 'n' valid blocks to
other segment (segment is still in dirty list) c) GC migrates '512 -
n' blocks to target segment (segment has 'n' cp_vblocks and '512 - n'
vblocks) d) If GC selects target segment via {AT,}SSR allocator,
however there is no free space in targe segment.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ARM: 9064/1: hw_breakpoint: Do not directly check the event's
overflow_handler hook The commit 1879445dfa7b ("perf/core: Set event's
default ::overflow_handler()") set a default event->overflow_handler
in perf_event_alloc(), and replace the check event->overflow_handler
with is_default_overflow_handler(), but one is missing. Currently, the
bp->overflow_handler can not be NULL. As a result,
enable_single_step() is always not invoked. Comments from Zhen Lei:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
KVM: SVM: Make sure GHCB is mapped before updating Access to the GHCB
is mainly in the VMGEXIT path and it is known that the GHCB will be
mapped. But there are two paths where it is possible the GHCB might
not be mapped. The sev_vcpu_deliver_sipi_vector() routine will update
the GHCB to inform the caller of the AP Reset Hold NAE event that a
SIPI has been delivered. However, if a SIPI is performed without a
corresponding AP Reset Hold, then the GHCB might not be mapped
(depending on the previous VMEXIT), which will result in a NULL
pointer dereference. The svm_complete_emulated_msr() routine will
update the GHCB to inform the caller of a RDMSR/WRMSR operation about
any errors. While it is likely that the GHCB will be mapped in this
situation, add a safe guard in this path to be certain a NULL pointer
dereference is not encountered.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net: Only allow init netns to set default tcp cong to a restricted
algo tcp_set_default_congestion_control() is netns-safe in that it
writes to &net->ipv4.tcp_congestion_control, but it also sets
ca->flags |= TCP_CONG_NON_RESTRICTED which is not namespaced. This has
the unintended side-effect of changing the global
net.ipv4.tcp_allowed_congestion_control sysctl, despite the fact that
it is read-only: 97684f0970f6 ("net: Make
tcp_allowed_congestion_control readonly in non-init netns") Resolve
this netns "leak" by only allowing the init netns to set the default
algorithm to one that is restricted. This restriction could be removed
if tcp_allowed_congestion_control were namespace-ified in the future.
This bug was uncovered with https://github.com/JonathonReinhart/linux-
netns-sysctl-verify

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
mm: memcontrol: slab: fix obtain a reference to a freeing memcg Patch
series "Use obj_cgroup APIs to charge kmem pages", v5. Since Roman's
series "The new cgroup slab memory controller" applied. All slab
objects are charged with the new APIs of obj_cgroup. The new APIs
introduce a struct obj_cgroup to charge slab objects. It prevents
long-living objects from pinning the original memory cgroup in the
memory. But there are still some corner objects (e.g. allocations
larger than order-1 page on SLUB) which are not charged with the new
APIs. Those objects (include the pages which are allocated from buddy
allocator directly) are charged as kmem pages which still hold a
reference to the memory cgroup. E.g. We know that the kernel stack is
charged as kmem pages because the size of the kernel stack can be
greater than 2 pages (e.g. 16KB on x86_64 or arm64). If we create a
thread (suppose the thread stack is charged to memory cgroup A) and
then move it from memory cgroup A to memory cgroup B. Because the
kernel stack of the thread hold a reference to the memory cgroup A.
The thread can pin the memory cgroup A in the memory even if we remove
the cgroup A. If we want to see this scenario by using the following
script. We can see that the system has added 500 dying cgroups (This
is not a real world issue, just a script to show that the large
kmallocs are charged as kmem pages which can pin the memory cgroup in
the memory). #!/bin/bash cat /proc/cgroups | grep memory cd
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory echo 1 > memory.move_charge_at_immigrate for i
in range{1..500} do mkdir kmem_test echo $$ > kmem_test/cgroup.procs
sleep 3600 & echo $$ > cgroup.procs echo `cat kmem_test/cgroup.procs`
> cgroup.procs rmdir kmem_test done cat /proc/cgroups | grep memory
This patchset aims to make those kmem pages to drop the reference to
memory cgroup by using the APIs of obj_cgroup. Finally, we can see
that the number of the dying cgroups will not increase if we run the
above test script. This patch (of 7): The rcu_read_lock/unlock only
can guarantee that the memcg will not be freed, but it cannot
guarantee the success of css_get (which is in the refill_stock when
cached memcg changed) to memcg. rcu_read_lock() memcg =
obj_cgroup_memcg(old) __memcg_kmem_uncharge(memcg) refill_stock(memcg)
if (stock->cached != memcg) // css_get can change the ref counter from
0 back to 1. css_get(&memcg->css) rcu_read_unlock() This fix is very
like the commit: eefbfa7fd678 ("mm: memcg/slab: fix use after free in
obj_cgroup_charge") Fix this by holding a reference to the memcg which
is passed to the __memcg_kmem_uncharge() before calling
__memcg_kmem_uncharge().

RDMA/siw: Fix a use after free in siw_alloc_mr Our code analyzer
reported a UAF. In siw_alloc_mr(), it calls siw_mr_add_mem(mr,..). In
the implementation of siw_mr_add_mem(), mem is assigned to mr->mem and
then mem is freed via kfree(mem) if xa_alloc_cyclic() failed. Here,
mr->mem still point to a freed object. After, the execution continue
up to the err_out branch of siw_alloc_mr, and the freed mr->mem is
used in siw_mr_drop_mem(mr). My patch moves "mr->mem = mem" behind the
if (xa_alloc_cyclic(..)<0) {} section, to avoid the uaf.

net:emac/emac-mac: Fix a use after free in emac_mac_tx_buf_send In
emac_mac_tx_buf_send, it calls emac_tx_fill_tpd(..,skb,..). If some
error happens in emac_tx_fill_tpd(), the skb will be freed via
dev_kfree_skb(skb) in error branch of emac_tx_fill_tpd(). But the
freed skb is still used via skb->len by netdev_sent_queue(,skb->len).
As i observed that emac_tx_fill_tpd() haven't modified the value of
skb->len, thus my patch assigns skb->len to 'len' before the possible
free and use 'len' instead of skb->len later.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
bnxt_en: Fix RX consumer index logic in the error path. In
bnxt_rx_pkt(), the RX buffers are expected to complete in order. If
the RX consumer index indicates an out of order buffer completion, it
means we are hitting a hardware bug and the driver will abort all
remaining RX packets and reset the RX ring. The RX consumer index that
we pass to bnxt_discard_rx() is not correct. We should be passing the
current index (tmp_raw_cons) instead of the old index (raw_cons). This
bug can cause us to be at the wrong index when trying to abort the
next RX packet. It can crash like this: #0 [ffff9bbcdf5c39a8]

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
m68k: mvme147,mvme16x: Don't wipe PCC timer config bits Don't clear
the timer 1 configuration bits when clearing the interrupt flag and
counter overflow. As Michael reported, "This results in no timer
interrupts being delivered after the first. Initialization then hangs
in calibrate_delay as the jiffies counter is not updated." On mvme16x,
enable the timer after requesting the irq, consistent with mvme147.

ath10k: Fix a use after free in ath10k_htc_send_bundle In
ath10k_htc_send_bundle, the bundle_skb could be freed by
dev_kfree_skb_any(bundle_skb). But the bundle_skb is used later by
bundle_skb->len. As skb_len = bundle_skb->len, my patch replaces
bundle_skb->len to skb_len after the bundle_skb was freed.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
powerpc/64: Fix the definition of the fixmap area At the time being,
the fixmap area is defined at the top of the address space or just
below KASAN. This definition is not valid for PPC64. For PPC64, use
the top of the I/O space. Because of circular dependencies, it is not
possible to include asm/fixmap.h in asm/book3s/64/pgtable.h , so
define a fixed size AREA at the top of the I/O space for fixmap and
ensure during build that the size is big enough.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
vsock/virtio: free queued packets when closing socket As reported by
syzbot [1], there is a memory leak while closing the socket. We
partially solved this issue with commit ac03046ece2b ("vsock/virtio:
free packets during the socket release"), but we forgot to drain the
RX queue when the socket is definitely closed by the scheduled work.
To avoid future issues, let's use the new
virtio_transport_remove_sock() to drain the RX queue before removing
the socket from the af_vsock lists calling vsock_remove_sock(). [1]

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
RDMA/rtrs-clt: destroy sysfs after removing session from active list A
session can be removed dynamically by sysfs interface "remove_path"
that eventually calls rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs function. The
current rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs first removes the sysfs
interfaces and frees sess->stats object. Second it removes the session
from the active list. Therefore some functions could access non-
connected session and access the freed sess->stats object even-if they
check the session status before accessing the session. For instance
rtrs_clt_request and get_next_path_min_inflight check the session
status and try to send IO to the session. The session status could be
changed when they are trying to send IO but they could not catch the
change and update the statistics information in sess->stats object,
and generate use-after-free problem. (see: "RDMA/rtrs-clt: Check state
of the rtrs_clt_sess before reading its stats") This patch changes the
rtrs_clt_remove_path_from_sysfs to remove the session from the active
session list and then destroy the sysfs interfaces. Each function
still should check the session status because closing or error
recovery paths can change the status.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
powerpc/64s: Fix pte update for kernel memory on radix When adding a
PTE a ptesync is needed to order the update of the PTE with subsequent
accesses otherwise a spurious fault may be raised. radix__set_pte_at()
does not do this for performance gains. For non-kernel memory this is
not an issue as any faults of this kind are corrected by the page
fault handler. For kernel memory these faults are not handled. The
current solution is that there is a ptesync in flush_cache_vmap()
which should be called when mapping from the vmalloc region. However,
map_kernel_page() does not call flush_cache_vmap(). This is
troublesome in particular for code patching with Strict RWX on radix.
In do_patch_instruction() the page frame that contains the instruction
to be patched is mapped and then immediately patched. With no ordering
or synchronization between setting up the PTE and writing to the page
it is possible for faults. As the code patching is done using
__put_user_asm_goto() the resulting fault is obscured - but using a
normal store instead it can be seen: BUG: Unable to handle kernel data
access on write at 0xc008000008f24a3c Faulting instruction address:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
iommu/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entries When
the first level page table is used for IOVA translation, it only
supports Read-Only and Read-Write permissions. The Write-Only
permission is not supported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read
permission) should always set. When using second level, we still give
separate permissions that allows WriteOnly which seems inconsistent
and awkward. We want to have consistent behavior. After moving to 1st
level, we don't want things to work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd
level for the same mappings. Hence remove this configuration.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
udp: skip L4 aggregation for UDP tunnel packets If
NETIF_F_GRO_FRAGLIST or NETIF_F_GRO_UDP_FWD are enabled, and there are
UDP tunnels available in the system, udp_gro_receive() could end-up
doing L4 aggregation (either SKB_GSO_UDP_L4 or SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST) at
the outer UDP tunnel level for packets effectively carrying and UDP
tunnel header. That could cause inner protocol corruption. If e.g. the
relevant packets carry a vxlan header, different vxlan ids will be
ignored/ aggregated to the same GSO packet. Inner headers will be
ignored, too, so that e.g. TCP over vxlan push packets will be held in
the GRO engine till the next flush, etc. Just skip the SKB_GSO_UDP_L4
and SKB_GSO_FRAGLIST code path if the current packet could land in a
UDP tunnel, and let udp_gro_receive() do GRO via
udp_sk(sk)->gro_receive. The check implemented in this patch is
broader than what is strictly needed, as the existing UDP tunnel could
be e.g. configured on top of a different device: we could end-up
skipping GRO at-all for some packets. Anyhow, that is a very thin
corner case and covering it will add quite a bit of complexity. v1 ->
v2: - hopefully clarify the commit message

Bluetooth: avoid deadlock between hci_dev->lock and socket lock Commit
eab2404ba798 ("Bluetooth: Add BT_PHY socket option") added a
dependency between socket lock and hci_dev->lock that could lead to
deadlock. It turns out that hci_conn_get_phy() is not in any way
relying on hdev being immutable during the runtime of this function,
neither does it even look at any of the members of hdev, and as such
there is no need to hold that lock. This fixes the lockdep splat

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ataflop: potential out of bounds in do_format() The function uses
"type" as an array index: q = unit[drive].disk[type]->queue;
Unfortunately the bounds check on "type" isn't done until later in the
function. Fix this by moving the bounds check to the start.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
io_uring: fix overflows checks in provide buffers Colin reported
before possible overflow and sign extension problems in
io_provide_buffers_prep(). As Linus pointed out previous attempt did
nothing useful, see d81269fecb8ce ("io_uring: fix provide_buffers sign
extension"). Do that with help of check_<op>_overflow helpers. And fix
struct io_provide_buf::len type, as it doesn't make much sense to keep
it signed.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
nvmet-tcp: fix incorrect locking in state_change sk callback We are
not changing anything in the TCP connection state so we should not
take a write_lock but rather a read lock. This caused a deadlock when
running nvmet-tcp and nvme-tcp on the same system, where state_change
callbacks on the host and on the controller side have causal
relationship and made lockdep report on this with blktests:

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
sched/fair: Fix shift-out-of-bounds in load_balance() Syzbot reported
a handful of occurrences where an sd->nr_balance_failed can grow to
much higher values than one would expect. A successful load_balance()
resets it to 0; a failed one increments it. Once it gets to
sd->cache_nice_tries + 3, this *should* trigger an active balance,
which will either set it to sd->cache_nice_tries+1 or reset it to 0.
However, in case the to-be-active-balanced task is not allowed to run
on env->dst_cpu, then the increment is done without any further
modification. This could then be repeated ad nauseam, and would
explain the absurdly high values reported by syzbot (86, 149).
VincentG noted there is value in letting sd->cache_nice_tries grow, so
the shift itself should be fixed. That means preventing: """ If the
value of the right operand is negative or is greater than or equal to
the width of the promoted left operand, the behavior is undefined. """
Thus we need to cap the shift exponent to
BITS_PER_TYPE(typeof(lefthand)) - 1. I had a look around for other
similar cases via coccinelle: @expr@ position pos; expression E1;
expression E2; @@ ( E1 >> E2@pos | E1 >> E2@pos ) @cst depends on
expr@ position pos; expression expr.E1; constant cst; @@ ( E1 >>
cst@pos | E1 << cst@pos ) @script:python depends on !cst@ pos <<
expr.pos; exp << expr.E2; @@ # Dirty hack to ignore constexpr if
exp.upper() != exp: coccilib.report.print_report(pos[0], "Possible UB
shift here") The only other match in kernel/sched is
rq_clock_thermal() which employs sched_thermal_decay_shift, and that
exponent is already capped to 10, so that one is fine.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
drm/amd/display: Fix off by one in hdmi_14_process_transaction() The
hdcp_i2c_offsets[] array did not have an entry for
HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_WRITE_CONTENT_STREAM_TYPE so it led to an off by one
read overflow. I added an entry and copied the 0x0 value for the
offset from similar code in
drivers/gpu/drm/amd/display/modules/hdcp/hdcp_ddc.c. I also declared
several of these arrays as having HDCP_MESSAGE_ID_MAX entries. This
doesn't change the code, but it's just a belt and suspenders approach
to try future proof the code.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: return -ENOMEM if dma_map_single fails The spi
controller supports 44-bit address space on AXI in DMA mode, so set
dma_addr_t width to 44-bit to avoid using a swiotlb mapping. In
addition, if dma_map_single fails, it should return immediately
instead of continuing doing the DMA operation which bases on invalid
address. This fixes the following crash which occurs in reading a big

MEMLOCK, MEMUNLOCK and OTPLOCK modify protection bits. Thus require
write permission. Depending on the hardware MEMLOCK might even be
write-once, e.g. for SPI-NOR flashes with their WP# tied to GND.
OTPLOCK is always write-once. MEMSETBADBLOCK modifies the bad block

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
regmap: set debugfs_name to NULL after it is freed There is a upstream
commit cffa4b2122f5("regmap:debugfs: Fix a memory leak when calling
regmap_attach_dev") that adds a if condition when create name for
debugfs_name. With below function invoking logical, debugfs_name is
freed in regmap_debugfs_exit(), but it is not created again because of
the if condition introduced by above commit. regmap_reinit_cache()
regmap_debugfs_exit() ... regmap_debugfs_init() So, set debugfs_name
to NULL after it is freed.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
KVM: Stop looking for coalesced MMIO zones if the bus is destroyed
Abort the walk of coalesced MMIO zones if kvm_io_bus_unregister_dev()
fails to allocate memory for the new instance of the bus. If it can't
instantiate a new bus, unregister_dev() destroys all devices _except_
the target device. But, it doesn't tell the caller that it obliterated
the bus and invoked the destructor for all devices that were on the
bus. In the coalesced MMIO case, this can result in a deleted list
entry dereference due to attempting to continue iterating on
coalesced_zones after future entries (in the walk) have been deleted.
Opportunistically add curly braces to the for-loop, which encompasses
many lines but sneaks by without braces due to the guts being a single
if statement.

SRCU If allocating a new instance of an I/O bus fails when
unregistering a device, wait to destroy the device until after all
readers are guaranteed to see the new null bus. Destroying devices
before the bus is nullified could lead to use-after-free since readers

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
KVM: SVM: Use online_vcpus, not created_vcpus, to iterate over vCPUs
Use the kvm_for_each_vcpu() helper to iterate over vCPUs when
encrypting VMSAs for SEV, which effectively switches to use
online_vcpus instead of created_vcpus. This fixes a possible null-
pointer dereference as created_vcpus does not guarantee a vCPU exists,
since it is updated at the very beginning of KVM_CREATE_VCPU.
created_vcpus exists to allow the bulk of vCPU creation to run in
parallel, while still correctly restricting the max number of max
vCPUs.

ht_3s_diff; struct rtw_2g_ns_pwr_idx_diff ht_4s_diff; }; The problem
arises because the value of group is 5 for channel 14. The trivial
increase in the dimension of bw40_base fails as this struct must match
the layout of efuse. The fix is to add the rate as an argument to
rtw_get_channel_group() and set the group for channel 14 to 4 if rate
<= DESC_RATE11M. This patch fixes commit fa6dfe6bff24 ("rtw88: resolve

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
async_xor: increase src_offs when dropping destination page Now we
support sharing one page if PAGE_SIZE is not equal stripe size. To
support this, it needs to support calculating xor value with different
offsets for each r5dev. One offset array is used to record those
offsets. In RMW mode, parity page is used as a source page. It sets
ASYNC_TX_XOR_DROP_DST before calculating xor value in ops_run_prexor5.
So it needs to add src_list and src_offs at the same time. Now it only
needs src_list. So the xor value which is calculated is wrong. It can
cause data corruption problem. I can reproduce this problem 100% on a
POWER8 machine. The steps are: mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -l5 -n3 /dev/sdb1
/dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1 --size=3G mkfs.xfs /dev/md0 mount /dev/md0
/mnt/test mount: /mnt/test: mount(2) system call failed: Structure

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
net/nfc: fix use-after-free llcp_sock_bind/connect Commits 8a4cd82d
("nfc: fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_connect()") and c33b1cc62 ("nfc:
fix refcount leak in llcp_sock_bind()") fixed a refcount leak bug in
bind/connect but introduced a use-after-free if the same local is
assigned to 2 different sockets. This can be triggered by the
following simple program: int sock1 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM,
NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP ); int sock2 = socket( AF_NFC, SOCK_STREAM,
NFC_SOCKPROTO_LLCP ); memset( &addr, 0, sizeof(struct
sockaddr_nfc_llcp) ); addr.sa_family = AF_NFC; addr.nfc_protocol =
NFC_PROTO_NFC_DEP; bind( sock1, (struct sockaddr*) &addr,
sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) ) bind( sock2, (struct sockaddr*)
&addr, sizeof(struct sockaddr_nfc_llcp) ) close(sock1); close(sock2);
Fix this by assigning NULL to llcp_sock->local after calling
nfc_llcp_local_put. This addresses CVE-2021-23134.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ipc/mqueue, msg, sem: avoid relying on a stack reference past its
expiry do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with a stack local address.
The sender (do_mq_timedsend) uses this address to later call
pipelined_send. This leads to a very hard to trigger race where a
do_mq_timedreceive call might return and leave do_mq_timedsend to rely
on an invalid address, causing the following crash: RIP:
0010:wake_q_add_safe+0x13/0x60 Call Trace:
__x64_sys_mq_timedsend+0x2a9/0x490 do_syscall_64+0x80/0x680
entry_SYSCALL_64_after_hwframe+0x44/0xa9 RIP: 0033:0x7f5928e40343 The
race occurs as: 1. do_mq_timedreceive calls wq_sleep with the address
of `struct ext_wait_queue` on function stack (aliased as `ewq_addr`
here) - it holds a valid `struct ext_wait_queue *` as long as the
stack has not been overwritten. 2. `ewq_addr` gets added to
info->e_wait_q[RECV].list in wq_add, and do_mq_timedsend receives it
via wq_get_first_waiter(info, RECV) to call __pipelined_op. 3. Sender
calls __pipelined_op::smp_store_release(&this->state, STATE_READY).
Here is where the race window begins. (`this` is `ewq_addr`.) 4. If
the receiver wakes up now in do_mq_timedreceive::wq_sleep, it will see
`state == STATE_READY` and break. 5. do_mq_timedreceive returns, and
`ewq_addr` is no longer guaranteed to be a `struct ext_wait_queue *`
since it was on do_mq_timedreceive's stack. (Although the address may
not get overwritten until another function happens to touch it, which
means it can persist around for an indefinite time.) 6.
do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() still believes `ewq_addr` is a
`struct ext_wait_queue *`, and uses it to find a task_struct to pass
to the wake_q_add_safe call. In the lucky case where nothing has
overwritten `ewq_addr` yet, `ewq_addr->task` is the right task_struct.
In the unlucky case, __pipelined_op::wake_q_add_safe gets handed a
bogus address as the receiver's task_struct causing the crash.
do_mq_timedsend::__pipelined_op() should not dereference `this` after
setting STATE_READY, as the receiver counterpart is now free to
return. Change __pipelined_op to call wake_q_add_safe on the
receiver's task_struct returned by get_task_struct, instead of
dereferencing `this` which sits on the receiver's stack. As Manfred
pointed out, the race potentially also exists in
ipc/msg.c::expunge_all and ipc/sem.c::wake_up_sem_queue_prepare. Fix
those in the same way.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
btrfs: fix removed dentries still existing after log is synced When we
move one inode from one directory to another and both the inode and
its previous parent directory were logged before, we are not supposed
to have the dentry for the old parent if we have a power failure after
the log is synced. Only the new dentry is supposed to exist. Generally
this works correctly, however there is a scenario where this is not
currently working, because the old parent of the file/directory that
was moved is not authoritative for a range that includes the dir index
and dir item keys of the old dentry. This case is better explained
with the following example and reproducer: # The test requires a very
specific layout of keys and items in the # fs/subvolume btree to
trigger the bug. So we want to make sure that # on whatever platform
we are, we have the same leaf/node size. # # Currently in btrfs the
node/leaf size can not be smaller than the page # size (but it can be
greater than the page size). So use the largest # supported node/leaf
size (64K). $ mkfs.btrfs -f -n 65536 /dev/sdc $ mount /dev/sdc /mnt #
"testdir" is inode 257. $ mkdir /mnt/testdir $ chmod 755 /mnt/testdir
# Create several empty files to have the directory "testdir" with its
# items spread over several leaves (7 in this case). $ for ((i = 1; i
<= 1200; i++)); do echo -n > /mnt/testdir/file$i done # Create our
test directory "dira", inode number 1458, which gets all # its items
in leaf 7. # # The BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY item for inode 257 ("testdir")
that points to # the entry named "dira" is in leaf 2, while the
BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY # item that points to that entry is in leaf 3. # #
For this particular filesystem node size (64K), file count and file #
names, we endup with the directory entry items from inode 257 in #
leaves 2 and 3, as previously mentioned - what matters for triggering
# the bug exercised by this test case is that those items are not
placed # in leaf 1, they must be placed in a leaf different from the
one # containing the inode item for inode 257. # # The corresponding
BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY and BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY items for # the parent
inode (257) are the following: # # item 460 key (257 DIR_ITEM
3724298081) itemoff 48344 itemsize 34 # location key (1458 INODE_ITEM
0) type DIR # transid 6 data_len 0 name_len 4 # name: dira # # and: #
# item 771 key (257 DIR_INDEX 1202) itemoff 36673 itemsize 34 #
location key (1458 INODE_ITEM 0) type DIR # transid 6 data_len 0
name_len 4 # name: dira $ mkdir /mnt/testdir/dira # Make sure
everything done so far is durably persisted. $ sync # Now do a change
to inode 257 ("testdir") that does not result in # COWing leaves 2 and
3 - the leaves that contain the directory items # pointing to inode
1458 (directory "dira"). # # Changing permissions, the owner/group,
updating or adding a xattr, # etc, will not change (COW) leaves 2 and
3. So for the sake of # simplicity change the permissions of inode
257, which results in # updating its inode item and therefore change
(COW) only leaf 1. $ chmod 700 /mnt/testdir # Now fsync directory
inode 257. # # Since only the first leaf was changed/COWed, we log the
inode item of # inode 257 and only the dentries found in the first
leaf, all have a # key type of BTRFS_DIR_ITEM_KEY, and no keys of type
# BTRFS_DIR_INDEX_KEY, because they sort after the former type and
none # exist in the first leaf. # # We also log 3 items that represent
ranges for dir items and dir # indexes for which the log is
authoritative: # # 1) a key of type BTRFS_DIR_LOG_ITEM_KEY, which

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
habanalabs/gaudi: Fix a potential use after free in
gaudi_memset_device_memory Our code analyzer reported a uaf. In
gaudi_memset_device_memory, cb is get via hl_cb_kernel_create() with 2
refcount. If hl_cs_allocate_job() failed, the execution runs into
release_cb branch. One ref of cb is dropped by hl_cb_put(cb) and could
be freed if other thread also drops one ref. Then cb is used by cb->id
later, which is a potential uaf. My patch add a variable 'id' to
accept the value of cb->id before the hl_cb_put(cb) is called, to
avoid the potential uaf.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
tun: avoid double free in tun_free_netdev Avoid double free in
tun_free_netdev() by moving the dev->tstats and tun->security allocs

the destructor will handle the frees. BUG: KASAN: double-free or

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
phonet/pep: refuse to enable an unbound pipe This ioctl() implicitly
assumed that the socket was already bound to a valid local socket
name, i.e. Phonet object. If the socket was not bound, two separate
problems would occur: 1) We'd send an pipe enablement request with an
invalid source object. 2) Later socket calls could BUG on the socket
unexpectedly being connected yet not bound to a valid object.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
mm/damon/dbgfs: protect targets destructions with kdamond_lock DAMON
debugfs interface iterates current monitoring targets in
'dbgfs_target_ids_read()' while holding the corresponding
'kdamond_lock'. However, it also destructs the monitoring targets in
'dbgfs_before_terminate()' without holding the lock. This can result
in a use_after_free bug. This commit avoids the race by protecting the
destruction with the corresponding 'kdamond_lock'.

function corresponding to file_operations is not implemented in
kfence. As a result, a memory leak occurs. Therefore, the solution to
this problem is to implement the corresponding release function.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
KVM: VMX: Always clear vmx->fail on emulation_required Revert a
relatively recent change that set vmx->fail if the vCPU is in L2 and
emulation_required is true, as that behavior is completely bogus.
Setting vmx->fail and synthesizing a VM-Exit is contradictory and
wrong: (a) it's impossible to have both a VM-Fail and VM-Exit (b)
vmcs.EXIT_REASON is not modified on VM-Fail (c) emulation_required
refers to guest state and guest state checks are always VM-Exits, not
VM-Fails. For KVM specifically, emulation_required is handled before
nested exits in __vmx_handle_exit(), thus setting vmx->fail has no
immediate effect, i.e. KVM calls into handle_invalid_guest_state() and
vmx->fail is ignored. Setting vmx->fail can ultimately result in a
WARN in nested_vmx_vmexit() firing when tearing down the VM as KVM
never expects vmx->fail to be set when L2 is active, KVM always
reflects those errors into L1. ------------[ cut here ]------------

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
KVM: x86/mmu: Don't advance iterator after restart due to yielding
After dropping mmu_lock in the TDP MMU, restart the iterator during
tdp_iter_next() and do not advance the iterator. Advancing the
iterator results in skipping the top-level SPTE and all its children,
which is fatal if any of the skipped SPTEs were not visited before
yielding. When zapping all SPTEs, i.e. when min_level == root_level,
restarting the iter and then invoking tdp_iter_next() is always fatal
if the current gfn has as a valid SPTE, as advancing the iterator
results in try_step_side() skipping the current gfn, which wasn't
visited before yielding. Sprinkle WARNs on iter->yielded being true in
various helpers that are often used in conjunction with yielding, and
tag the helper with __must_check to reduce the probabily of improper
usage. Failing to zap a top-level SPTE manifests in one of two ways.
If a valid SPTE is skipped by both kvm_tdp_mmu_zap_all() and
kvm_tdp_mmu_put_root(), the shadow page will be leaked and KVM will
WARN accordingly. WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 3509 at

existed even before commit 1af4a96025b3 ("KVM: x86/mmu: Yield in TDU
MMU iter even if no SPTES changed") moved calls to
tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() to the beginning of loops, as KVM could
still incorrectly advance past a top-level entry when yielding on a
lower-level entry. But with respect to leaking shadow pages, the bug
was introduced by yielding before processing the current gfn.
Alternatively, tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() could simply fall through,
or callers could jump to their "retry" label. The downside of that
approach is that tdp_mmu_iter_cond_resched() _must_ be called before
anything else in the loop, and there's no easy way to enfornce that
requirement. Ideally, KVM would handling the cond_resched() fully
within the iterator macro (the code is actually quite clean) and avoid
this entire class of bugs, but that is extremely difficult do wh

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ALSA: rawmidi - fix the uninitalized user_pversion The user_pversion
was uninitialized for the user space file structure in the open
function, because the file private structure use kmalloc for the
allocation. The kernel ALSA sequencer code clears the file structure,
so no additional fixes are required. BugLink: https://github.com/alsa-

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer overflow/underflow in hysteresis
calculations Commit b50aa49638c7 ("hwmon: (lm90) Prevent integer
underflows of temperature calculations") addressed a number of
underflow situations when writing temperature limits. However, it
missed one situation, seen when an attempt is made to set the
hysteresis value to MAX_LONG and the critical temperature limit is
negative. Use clamp_val() when setting the hysteresis temperature to
ensure that the provided value can never overflow or underflow.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
inet: fully convert sk->sk_rx_dst to RCU rules syzbot reported various
issues around early demux, one being included in this changelog [1]
sk->sk_rx_dst is using RCU protection without clearly documenting it.
And following sequences in tcp_v4_do_rcv()/tcp_v6_do_rcv() are not
following standard RCU rules. [a] dst_release(dst); [b] sk->sk_rx_dst
= NULL; They look wrong because a delete operation of RCU protected
pointer is supposed to clear the pointer before the
call_rcu()/synchronize_rcu() guarding actual memory freeing. In some
cases indeed, dst could be freed before [b] is done. We could cheat by
clearing sk_rx_dst before calling dst_release(), but this seems the
right time to stick to standard RCU annotations and debugging
facilities. [1] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in dst_check

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ice: xsk: return xsk buffers back to pool when cleaning the ring
Currently we only NULL the xdp_buff pointer in the internal SW ring
but we never give it back to the xsk buffer pool. This means that
buffers can be leaked out of the buff pool and never be used again.
Add missing xsk_buff_free() call to the routine that is supposed to
clean the entries that are left in the ring so that these buffers in
the umem can be used by other sockets. Also, only go through the space
that is actually left to be cleaned instead of a whole ring.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
NFSD: Fix READDIR buffer overflow If a client sends a READDIR count
argument that is too small (say, zero), then the buffer size
calculation in the new init_dirlist helper functions results in an
underflow, allowing the XDR stream functions to write beyond the
actual buffer. This calculation has always been suspect. NFSD has
never sanity- checked the READDIR count argument, but the old entry
encoders managed the problem correctly. With the commits below, entry
encoding changed, exposing the underflow to the pointer arithmetic in
xdr_reserve_space(). Modern NFS clients attempt to retrieve as much
data as possible for each READDIR request. Also, we have no unit tests
that exercise the behavior of READDIR at the lower bound of @count
values. Thus this case was missed during testing.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
drm/mediatek: hdmi: Perform NULL pointer check for mtk_hdmi_conf In
commit 41ca9caaae0b ("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add check for CEA modes
only") a check for CEA modes was added to function
mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid() in order to address possible issues on
MT8167; moreover, with commit c91026a938c2 ("drm/mediatek: hdmi: Add
optional limit on maximal HDMI mode clock") another similar check was
introduced. Unfortunately though, at the time of writing, MT8173 does
not provide any mtk_hdmi_conf structure and this is crashing the
kernel with NULL pointer upon entering mtk_hdmi_bridge_mode_valid(),
which happens as soon as a HDMI cable gets plugged in. To fix this
regression, add a NULL pointer check for hdmi->conf in the said
function, restoring HDMI functionality and avoiding NULL pointer
kernel panics.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
neighbour: allow NUD_NOARP entries to be forced GCed IFF_POINTOPOINT
interfaces use NUD_NOARP entries for IPv6. It's possible to fill up
the neighbour table with enough entries that it will overflow for
valid connections after that. This behaviour is more prevalent after
commit 58956317c8de ("neighbor: Improve garbage collection") is
applied, as it prevents removal from entries that are not NUD_FAILED,
unless they are more than 5s old.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
x86/kvm: Disable kvmclock on all CPUs on shutdown Currenly, we disable
kvmclock from machine_shutdown() hook and this only happens for boot
CPU. We need to disable it for all CPUs to guard against memory
corruption e.g. on restore from hibernate. Note, writing '0' to
kvmclock MSR doesn't clear memory location, it just prevents
hypervisor from updating the location so for the short while after
write and while CPU is still alive, the clock remains usable and
correct so we don't need to switch to some other clocksource.

to prevent the task from being freed if the thread returns (which can
be triggered by the frontend) before the call to kthread_stop done as
part of the backend tear down. Not taking the reference will lead to a
use-after-free in that scenario. Such reference was taken before but
dropped as part of the rework done in 2ac061ce97f4. Reintroduce the
reference taking and add a comment this time explaining why it's
needed. This is XSA-374 / CVE-2021-28691.

x86/kvm: Teardown PV features on boot CPU as well Various PV features
(Async PF, PV EOI, steal time) work through memory shared with
hypervisor and when we restore from hibernation we must properly
teardown all these features to make sure hypervisor doesn't write to
stale locations after we jump to the previously hibernated kernel
(which can try to place anything there). For secondary CPUs the job is
already done by kvm_cpu_down_prepare(), register syscore ops to do the
same for boot CPU.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
btrfs: abort in rename_exchange if we fail to insert the second ref
Error injection stress uncovered a problem where we'd leave a dangling
inode ref if we failed during a rename_exchange. This happens because
we insert the inode ref for one side of the rename, and then for the
other side. If this second inode ref insert fails we'll leave the
first one dangling and leave a corrupt file system behind. Fix this by
aborting if we did the insert for the first inode ref.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
ocfs2: fix data corruption by fallocate When fallocate punches holes
out of inode size, if original isize is in the middle of last cluster,
then the part from isize to the end of the cluster will be zeroed with
buffer write, at that time isize is not yet updated to match the new
size, if writeback is kicked in, it will invoke
ocfs2_writepage()->block_write_full_page() where the pages out of
inode size will be dropped. That will cause file corruption. Fix this
by zero out eof blocks when extending the inode size. Running the
following command with qemu-image 4.2.1 can get a corrupted coverted
image file easily. qemu-img convert -p -t none -T none -f qcow2
$qcow_image \ -O qcow2 -o compat=1.1 $qcow_image.conv The usage of
fallocate in qemu is like this, it first punches holes out of inode
size, then extend the inode size. fallocate(11,
FALLOC_FL_KEEP_SIZE|FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE, 2276196352, 65536) = 0
