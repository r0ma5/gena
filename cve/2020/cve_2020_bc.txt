Fedora CoreOS supports setting a GRUB bootloader password using a
Butane config. When this feature is enabled, GRUB requires a password
to access the GRUB command-line, modify kernel command-line arguments,
or boot non-default OSTree deployments. Recent Fedora CoreOS releases
have a misconfiguration which allows booting non-default OSTree
deployments without entering a password. This allows someone with
access to the GRUB menu to boot into an older version of Fedora
CoreOS, reverting any security fixes that have recently been applied
to the machine. A password is still required to modify kernel command-
line arguments and to access the GRUB command line.

Ahsay AhsayCBS 9.1.4.0 allows an authenticated system user to inject
arbitrary Java JVM options. Administrators that can modify the Runtime
Options in the web interface can inject Java Runtime Options. These
take effect after a restart. For example, an attacker can enable JMX
services and consequently achieve remote code execution as the system
user.

In dotCMS 5.x-22.06, TempFileAPI allows a user to create a temporary
file based on a passed in URL, while attempting to block any SSRF
access to local IP addresses or private subnets. In resolving this
URL, the TempFileAPI follows any 302 redirects that the remote URL
returns. Because there is no re-validation of the redirect URL, the
TempFileAPI can be used to return data from those local/private hosts
that should not be accessible remotely.

CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN and a HTML hidden field called CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN to
avoid Cross Site Request Forgery attacks. The CRAFT_CSRF_TOKEN cookie
discloses the password hash in without encoding it whereas the

A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to
have signed a malicious certificate or for an application to continue
certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a
trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address in a
certificate to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the
`.' character (decimal 46) on the stack. This buffer overflow could
result in a crash (causing a denial of service). In a TLS client, this
can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server,
this can be triggered if the server requests client authentication and
a malicious client connects.

With Apache Ivy 2.4.0 an optional packaging attribute has been
introduced that allows artifacts to be unpacked on the fly if they
used pack200 or zip packaging. For artifacts using the "zip", "jar" or
"war" packaging Ivy prior to 2.5.1 doesn't verify the target path when
extracting the archive. An archive containing absolute paths or paths
that try to traverse "upwards" using ".." sequences can then write
files to any location on the local fie system that the user executing
Ivy has write access to. Ivy users of version 2.4.0 to 2.5.0 should
upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.

When Apache Ivy downloads artifacts from a repository it stores them
in the local file system based on a user-supplied "pattern" that may
include placeholders for artifacts coordinates like the organisation,
module or version. If said coordinates contain "../" sequences - which
are valid characters for Ivy coordinates in general - it is possible
the artifacts are stored outside of Ivy's local cache or repository or
can overwrite different artifacts inside of the local cache. In order
to exploit this vulnerability an attacker needs collaboration by the
remote repository as Ivy will issue http requests containing ".."
sequences and a "normal" repository will not interpret them as part of
the artifact coordinates. Users of Apache Ivy 2.0.0 to 2.5.1 should
upgrade to Ivy 2.5.1.

A vulnerability was found in the device-mapper-multipath. The device-
mapper-multipath allows local users to obtain root access, exploited
alone or in conjunction with CVE-2022-41973. Local users that are able
to write to UNIX domain sockets can bypass access controls and
manipulate the multipath setup. This issue occurs because an attacker
can repeat a keyword, which is mishandled when arithmetic ADD is used
instead of bitwise OR. This could lead to local privilege escalation
to root.

An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0. When a TLS 1.3 client
connects to a wolfSSL server and SSL_clear is called on its session,
the server crashes with a segmentation fault. This occurs in the
second session, which is created through TLS session resumption and
reuses the initial struct WOLFSSL. If the server reuses the previous
session structure (struct WOLFSSL) by calling wolfSSL_clear(WOLFSSL*
ssl) on it, the next received Client Hello (that resumes the previous
session) crashes the server. Note that this bug is only triggered when
resuming sessions using TLS session resumption. Only servers that use
wolfSSL_clear instead of the recommended SSL_free; SSL_new sequence
are affected. Furthermore, wolfSSL_clear is part of wolfSSL's
compatibility layer and is not enabled by default. It is not part of
wolfSSL's native API.

An issue was discovered in wolfSSL before 5.5.0 (when --enable-
session-ticket is used); however, only version 5.3.0 is exploitable.
Man-in-the-middle attackers or a malicious server can crash TLS 1.2
clients during a handshake. If an attacker injects a large ticket
(more than 256 bytes) into a NewSessionTicket message in a TLS 1.2
handshake, and the client has a non-empty session cache, the session
cache frees a pointer that points to unallocated memory, causing the
client to crash with a "free(): invalid pointer" message. NOTE: It is
likely that this is also exploitable during TLS 1.3 handshakes between
a client and a malicious server. With TLS 1.3, it is not possible to
exploit this as a man-in-the-middle.

loaded but not displayed.) The Content-Type response header reflects
the actual content type of the file being requested. This allows an
attacker to enumerate files on the local system. Additionally, remote

telnetd in GNU Inetutils through 2.3, MIT krb5-appl through 1.0.3, and
derivative works has a NULL pointer dereference via 0xff 0xf7 or 0xff
0xf8. In a typical installation, the telnetd application would crash
but the telnet service would remain available through inetd. However,
if the telnetd application has many crashes within a short time
interval, the telnet service would become unavailable after inetd logs
a "telnet/tcp server failing (looping), service terminated" error.
NOTE: MIT krb5-appl is not supported upstream but is shipped by a few
Linux distributions. The affected code was removed from the supported
MIT Kerberos 5 (aka krb5) product many years ago, at version 1.8.

Reference: URL:https://www.synopsys.com/blogs/software-security/cyrc-advisory-open5gs/

When Open5GS UPF receives a PFCP Session Establishment Request, it
stores related values for building the PFCP Session Establishment
Response. Once UPF receives a request, it gets the f_teid_len from
incoming message, and then uses it to copy data from incoming message
to struct f_teid without checking the maximum length. If the
pdi.local_f_teid.len exceeds the maximum length of the struct of
f_teid, the memcpy() overwrites the fields (e.g., f_teid_len) after
f_teid in the pdr struct. After parsing the request, the UPF starts to
build a response. The f_teid_len with its overwritten value is used as
a length for memcpy(). A segmentation fault occurs, as a result of a
memcpy(), if this overwritten value is large enough.

An attacker sending a single malformed IEEE 802.15.4 (Zigbee) frame
makes the TRDFRI bulb blink, and if they replay (i.e. resend) the
same frame multiple times, the bulb performs a factory reset. This
causes the bulb to lose configuration information about the Zigbee
network and current brightness level. After this attack, all lights
are on with full brightness, and a user cannot control the bulbs with
either the IKEA Home Smart app or the TRDFRI remote control. The
malformed Zigbee frame is an unauthenticated broadcast message, which
means all vulnerable devices within radio range are affected. CVSS 3.1

Use After Free vulnerability in Linux Kernel allows Privilege
Escalation. An improper Update of Reference Count in io_uring leads to
Use-After-Free and Local Privilege Escalation. When io_msg_ring was
invoked with a fixed file, it called io_fput_file() which improperly
decreased its reference count (leading to Use-After-Free and Local
Privilege Escalation). Fixed files are permanently registered to the
ring, and should not be put separately. We recommend upgrading past
commit https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/fc7222c3a9f56271fba02a

Rapid7 Nexpose and InsightVM versions 6.6.82 through 6.6.177 fail to
validate the certificate of the update server when downloading
updates. This failure could allow an attacker in a privileged position
on the network to provide their own HTTPS endpoint, or intercept
communications to the legitimate endpoint. The attacker would need
some pre-existing access to at least one node on the network path
between the Rapid7-controlled update server and the Nexpose/InsightVM
application, and the ability to either spoof the update server's FQDN
or redirect legitimate traffic to the attacker's server in order to
exploit this vulnerability. Note that even in this scenario, an
attacker could not normally replace an update package with a malicious
package, since the update process validates a separate, code-signing
certificate, distinct from the HTTPS certificate used for
communication. This issue was resolved on February 1, 2023 in update
6.6.178 of Nexpose and InsightVM.

Apache Calcite 1.22.0 introduced the SQL operators EXISTS_NODE,
EXTRACT_XML, XML_TRANSFORM and EXTRACT_VALUE do not restrict XML
External Entity references in their configuration, making them
vulnerable to a potential XML External Entity (XXE) attack. Therefore
any client exposing these operators, typically by using Oracle dialect
(the first three) or MySQL dialect (the last one), is affected by this
vulnerability (the extent of it will depend on the user under which
the application is running). From Apache Calcite 1.32.0 onwards,
Document Type Declarations and XML External Entity resolution are
disabled on the impacted operators.

A flaw was found in the offline_access scope in Keycloak. This issue
would affect users of shared computers more (especially if cookies are
not cleared), due to a lack of root session validation, and the reuse
of session ids across root and user authentication sessions. This
enables an attacker to resolve a user session attached to a previously
authenticated user; when utilizing the refresh token, they will be
issued a token for the original user.

A program using FoundationNetworking in swift-corelibs-foundation is
potentially vulnerable to CRLF ( ) injection in URLRequest headers. In
this vulnerability, a client can insert one or several CRLF sequences
into a URLRequest header value. When that request is sent via
URLSession to an HTTP server, the server may interpret the content
after the CRLF as extra headers, or even a second request. For
example, consider a URLRequest to http://example.com/ with the GET
method. Suppose we set the URLRequest header "Foo" to the value "Bar
Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1". When this request is sent,
it will appear to the server as two requests: GET / HTTP/1.1 Foo: Bar
Extra-Header: Added GET /other HTTP/1.1 In this manner, the client is
able to inject extra headers and craft an entirely new request to a
separate path, despite only making one API call in URLSession. If a
developer has total control over the request and its headers, this
vulnerability may not pose a threat. However, this vulnerability
escalates if un-sanitized user input is placed in header values. If
so, a malicious user could inject new headers or requests to an
intermediary or backend server. Developers should be especially
careful to sanitize user input in this case, or upgrade their version
of swift-corelibs-foundation to include the patch below.

GLPI - Reports plugin for GLPI Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting (RXSS).
Type 1: Reflected XSS (or Non-Persistent) - The server reads data
directly from the HTTP request and reflects it back in the HTTP
response. Reflected XSS exploits occur when an attacker causes a
victim to supply dangerous content to a vulnerable web application,
which is then reflected back to the victim and executed by the web
browser. The most common mechanism for delivering malicious content is
to include it as a parameter in a URL that is posted publicly or
emailed directly to the victim. URLs constructed in this manner
constitute the core of many phishing schemes, whereby an attacker
convinces a victim to visit a URL that refers to a vulnerable site.
After the site reflects the attacker's content back to the victim, the
content is executed by the victim's browser.

immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and
verification. immudb client SDKs use server's UUID to distinguish
between different server instance so that the client can connect to
different immudb instances and keep the state for multiple servers.
SDK does not validate this uuid and can accept any value reported by
the server. A malicious server can change the reported UUID tricking
the client to treat it as a different server thus accepting a state
completely irrelevant to the one previously retrieved from the server.
This issue has been patched in version 1.4.1. As a workaround, when
initializing an immudb client object a custom state handler can be
used to store the state. Providing custom implementation that ignores
the server UUID can be used to ensure that even if the server changes
the UUID, client will still consider it to be the same server.

Dendrite is a Matrix homeserver written in Go. In affected versions
events retrieved from a remote homeserver using the
`/get_missing_events` path did not have their signatures verified
correctly. This could potentially allow a remote homeserver to provide
invalid/modified events to Dendrite via this endpoint. Note that this
does not apply to events retrieved through other endpoints (e.g.
`/event`, `/state`) as they have been correctly verified. Homeservers
that have federation disabled are not vulnerable. The problem has been
fixed in Dendrite 0.9.8. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this issue.

matrix-appservice-irc is an open source Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix.
The Internet Relay Chat (IRC) protocol allows you to specify multiple
modes in a single mode command. Due to a bug in the underlying matrix-
org/node-irc library, affected versions of matrix-appservice-irc
perform parsing of such modes incorrectly, potentially resulting in
the wrong user being given permissions. Mode commands can only be
executed by privileged users, so this can only be abused if an
operator is tricked into running the command on behalf of an attacker.
The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc 0.35.0. As
a workaround users should refrain from entering mode commands
suggested by untrusted users. Avoid using multiple modes in a single
command.

matrix-appservice-irc is an open source Node.js IRC bridge for Matrix.
Attackers can specify a specific string of characters, which would
confuse the bridge into combining an attacker-owned channel and an
existing channel, allowing them to grant themselves permissions in the
channel. The vulnerability has been patched in matrix-appservice-irc
0.35.0. As a workaround operators may disable dynamic channel joining
via `dynamicChannels.enabled` to prevent users from joining new
channels, which prevents any new channels being bridged outside of
what is already bridged, and what is specified in the config.

Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and
Kanban. In versions of Onedev prior to 7.3.0 unauthenticated users can
take over a OneDev instance if there is no properly configured reverse
proxy. The /git-prereceive-callback endpoint is used by the pre-
receive git hook on the server to check for branch protections during
a push event. It is only intended to be accessed from localhost, but
the check relies on the X-Forwarded-For header. Invoking this endpoint
leads to the execution of one of various git commands. The environment
variables of this command execution can be controlled via query
parameters. This allows attackers to write to arbitrary files, which
can in turn lead to the execution of arbitrary code. Such an attack
would be very hard to detect, which increases the potential impact
even more. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
workarounds for this issue.

Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and
Kanban. When using Docker-based job executors, the Docker socket (e.g.
/var/run/docker.sock on Linux) is mounted into each Docker step. Users
that can define and trigger CI/CD jobs on a project could use this to
control the Docker daemon on the host machine. This is a known
dangerous pattern, as it can be used to break out of Docker containers
and, in most cases, gain root privileges on the host system. This
issue allows regular (non-admin) users to potentially take over the
build infrastructure of a OneDev instance. Attackers need to have an
account (or be able to register one) and need permission to create a
project. Since code.onedev.io has the right preconditions for this to
be exploited by remote attackers, it could have been used to hijack
builds of OneDev itself, e.g. by injecting malware into the docker
images that are built and pushed to Docker Hub. The impact is
increased by this as described before. Users are advised to upgrade to
7.3.0 or higher. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Onedev is an open source, self-hosted Git Server with CI/CD and
Kanban. During CI/CD builds, it is possible to save build artifacts
for later retrieval. They can be accessed through OneDev's web UI
after the successful run of a build. These artifact files are served
by the webserver in the same context as the UI without any further
restrictions. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) when a user
creates a build artifact that contains HTML. When accessing the
artifact, the content is rendered by the browser, including any
JavaScript that it contains. Since all cookies (except for the
rememberMe one) do not set the HttpOnly flag, an attacker could steal
the session of a victim and use it to impersonate them. To exploit
this issue, attackers need to be able to modify the content of
artifacts, which usually means they need to be able to modify a
project's build spec. The exploitation requires the victim to click on
an attacker's link. It can be used to elevate privileges by targeting
admins of a OneDev instance. In the worst case, this can lead to
arbitrary code execution on the server, because admins can create
Server Shell Executors and use them to run any command on the server.
This issue has been patched in version 7.3.0. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop
platforms. Due to missing canonicalization when `readDir` is called
recursively, it was possible to display directory listings outside of
the defined `fs` scope. This required a crafted symbolic link or
junction folder inside an allowed path of the `fs` scope. No arbitrary
file content could be leaked. The issue has been resolved in version
1.0.6 and the implementation now properly checks if the requested
(sub) directory is a symbolic link outside of the defined `scope`.
Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable
the `readDir` endpoint in the `allowlist` inside the
`tauri.conf.json`.

Dex is an identity service that uses OpenID Connect to drive
authentication for other apps. Dex instances with public clients (and
by extension, clients accepting tokens issued by those Dex instances)
are affected by this vulnerability if they are running a version prior
to 2.35.0. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by making a
victim navigate to a malicious website and guiding them through the
OIDC flow, stealing the OAuth authorization code in the process. The
authorization code then can be exchanged by the attacker for a token,
gaining access to applications accepting that token. Version 2.35.0
has introduced a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

execution if the RPM contains a malicious "payload compressor" field.
This vulnerability impacts the `extract` and `files` methods of the

issues. A workaround for this issue is to ensure any RPMs being
processed contain valid/known payload compressor values such as gzip,
bzip2, xz, zstd, and lzma. The payload compressor field in an rpm can
be checked by using the rpm command line tool.

Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any
infrastructure that can run Node.js. In versions prior to 4.10.15, or
5.0.0 and above prior to 5.2.6, a user can write to the session object

attacker can assign the session object to their own user by writing to
the `user` field and then read any custom fields of that session
object. Note that assigning a session to another user does not usually
change the privileges of either of the two users, and a user cannot
assign their own session to another user. This issue is patched in
version 4.10.15 and above, and 5.2.6 and above. To mitigate this issue
in unpatched versions add a `beforeSave` trigger to the `_Session`
class and prevent writing if the requesting user is different from the
user in the session object.

Grafana is an open source data visualization platform for metrics,
logs, and traces. Versions prior to 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 allow one user to
block another user's login attempt by registering someone else'e email
address as a username. A Grafana user&#8217;s username and email address are
unique fields, that means no other user can have the same username or
email address as another user. A user can have an email address as a
username. However, the login system allows users to log in with either
username or email address. Since Grafana allows a user to log in with
either their username or email address, this creates an usual behavior
where `user_1` can register with one email address and `user_2` can
register their username as `user_1`&#8217;s email address. This prevents
`user_1` logging into the application since `user_1`'s password won&#8217;t
match with `user_2`'s email address. Versions 9.1.8 and 8.5.14 contain
a patch. There are no workarounds for this issue.

netlify-ipx is an on-Demand image optimization for Netlify using ipx.
In versions prior to 1.2.3, an attacker can bypass the source image
domain allowlist by sending specially crafted headers, causing the
handler to load and return arbitrary images. Because the response is
cached globally, this image will then be served to visitors without
requiring those headers to be set. XSS can be achieved by requesting a
malicious SVG with embedded scripts, which would then be served from
the site domain. Note that this does not apply to images loaded in
`<img>` tags, as scripts do not execute in this context. The image URL
can be set in the header independently of the request URL, meaning any
site images that have not previously been cached can have their cache
poisoned. This problem has been fixed in version 1.2.3. As a
workaround, cached content can be cleared by re-deploying the site.

This issue can affect BIND 9 resolvers with `stale-answer-enable yes;`
that also make use of the option `stale-answer-client-timeout`,
configured with a value greater than zero. If the resolver receives
many queries that require recursion, there will be a corresponding
increase in the number of clients that are waiting for recursion to
complete. If there are sufficient clients already waiting when a new
client query is received so that it is necessary to SERVFAIL the
longest waiting client (see BIND 9 ARM `recursive-clients` limit and
soft quota), then it is possible for a race to occur between providing
a stale answer to this older client and sending an early timeout
SERVFAIL, which may cause an assertion failure. This issue affects

Frontier is an Ethereum compatibility layer for Substrate. Prior to

adversary can construct blocks with transactions that have large
amount of refunds or unused gases with reverts, and as a result
inflate up the chain gas prices. The impact of this issue is limited

NuProcess is an external process execution implementation for Java. In
all the versions of NuProcess where it forks processes by using the
JVM's Java_java_lang_UNIXProcess_forkAndExec method (1.2.0+),
attackers can use NUL characters in their strings to perform command
line injection. Java's ProcessBuilder isn't vulnerable because of a
check in ProcessBuilder.start. NuProcess is missing that check. This
vulnerability can only be exploited to inject command line arguments
on Linux. Version 2.0.5 contains a patch. As a workaround, users of
the library can sanitize command strings to remove NUL characters
prior to passing them to NuProcess for execution.

matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version
1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can
construct messages appearing to have come from another person. Such
messages will be marked with a grey shield on some platforms, but this
may be missing in others. This attack is possible due to the key
forwarding strategy implemented in the matrix-android-sdk2 that is too
permissive. Starting with version 1.5.1, the default policy for
accepting key forwards has been made more strict in the matrix-
android-sdk2. The matrix-android-sdk2 will now only accept forwarded
keys in response to previously issued requests and only from own,
verified devices. The SDK now sets a `trusted` flag on the decrypted
message upon decryption, based on whether the key used to decrypt the
message was received from a trusted source. Clients need to ensure
that messages decrypted with a key with `trusted = false` are
decorated appropriately (for example, by showing a warning for such
messages). As a workaroubnd, current users of the SDK can disable key
forwarding in their forks using
`CryptoService#enableKeyGossiping(enable: Boolean)`.

matrix-android-sdk2 is the Matrix SDK for Android. Prior to version
1.5.1, an attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver can
construct messages that legitimately appear to have come from another
person, without any indication such as a grey shield. Additionally, a
sophisticated attacker cooperating with a malicious homeserver could
employ this vulnerability to perform a targeted attack in order to
send fake to-device messages appearing to originate from another user.
This can allow, for example, to inject the key backup secret during a
self-verification, to make a targeted device start using a malicious
key backup spoofed by the homeserver. matrix-android-sdk2 would then
additionally sign such a key backup with its device key, spilling
trust over to other devices trusting the matrix-android-sdk2 device.
These attacks are possible due to a protocol confusion vulnerability
that accepts to-device messages encrypted with Megolm instead of Olm.
matrix-android-sdk2 version 1.5.1 has been modified to only accept
Olm-encrypted to-device messages and to stop signing backups on a
successful decryption. Out of caution, several other checks have been
audited or added. This attack requires coordination between a
malicious home server and an attacker, so those who trust their home
servers do not need a workaround.

Matrix JavaScript SDK is the Matrix Client-Server software development
kit (SDK) for JavaScript. Prior to version 19.7.0, an attacker
cooperating with a malicious homeserver could interfere with the
verification flow between two users, injecting its own cross-signing
user identity in place of one of the users&#8217; identities. This would
lead to the other device trusting/verifying the user identity under
the control of the homeserver instead of the intended one. The
vulnerability is a bug in the matrix-js-sdk, caused by checking and
signing user identities and devices in two separate steps, and
inadequately fixing the keys to be signed between those steps. Even
though the attack is partly made possible due to the design decision
of treating cross-signing user identities as Matrix devices on the
server side (with their device ID set to the public part of the user
identity key), no other examined implementations were vulnerable.
Starting with version 19.7.0, the matrix-js-sdk has been modified to
double check that the key signed is the one that was verified instead
of just referencing the key by ID. An additional check has been made
to report an error when one of the device ID matches a cross-signing
key. As this attack requires coordination between a malicious
homeserver and an attacker, those who trust their homeservers do not
need a particular workaround.

Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system.
Versions prior to 2.30.6, 2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5,
2.36.3, and 2.37.4 are subject to exposure of sensitive information to
a malicious actor. When performing a local clone (where the source and
target of the clone are on the same volume), Git copies the contents
of the source's `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory into the destination by
either creating hardlinks to the source contents, or copying them (if
hardlinks are disabled via `--no-hardlinks`). A malicious actor could
convince a victim to clone a repository with a symbolic link pointing
at sensitive information on the victim's machine. This can be done
either by having the victim clone a malicious repository on the same
machine, or having them clone a malicious repository embedded as a
bare repository via a submodule from any source, provided they clone
with the `--recurse-submodules` option. Git does not create symbolic
links in the `$GIT_DIR/objects` directory. The problem has been
patched in the versions published on 2022-10-18, and backported to
v2.30.x. Potential workarounds: Avoid cloning untrusted repositories
using the `--local` optimization when on a shared machine, either by
passing the `--no-local` option to `git clone` or cloning from a URL
that uses the `file://` scheme. Alternatively, avoid cloning
repositories from untrusted sources with `--recurse-submodules` or run
`git config --global protocol.file.allow user`.

Matrix iOS SDK allows developers to build iOS apps compatible with
Matrix. Prior to version 0.23.19, an attacker cooperating with a
malicious homeserver can construct messages appearing to have come
from another person. Such messages will be marked with a grey shield
on some platforms, but this may be missing in others. This attack is
possible due to the matrix-ios-sdk implementing a too permissive key
forwarding strategy. The default policy for accepting key forwards has
been made more strict in the matrix-ios-sdk version 0.23.19. matrix-
ios-sdk will now only accept forwarded keys in response to previously
issued requests and only from own, verified devices. The SDK now sets
a `trusted` flag on the decrypted message upon decryption, based on
whether the key used to decrypt the message was received from a
trusted source. Clients need to ensure that messages decrypted with a
key with `trusted = false` are decorated appropriately (for example,
by showing a warning for such messages). This attack requires
coordination between a malicious home server and an attacker, so those
who trust their home servers do not need a workaround.

Git is an open source, scalable, distributed revision control system.
`git shell` is a restricted login shell that can be used to implement
Git's push/pull functionality via SSH. In versions prior to 2.30.6,
2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4, the
function that splits the command arguments into an array improperly
uses an `int` to represent the number of entries in the array,
allowing a malicious actor to intentionally overflow the return value,
leading to arbitrary heap writes. Because the resulting array is then
passed to `execv()`, it is possible to leverage this attack to gain
remote code execution on a victim machine. Note that a victim must
first allow access to `git shell` as a login shell in order to be
vulnerable to this attack. This problem is patched in versions 2.30.6,
2.31.5, 2.32.4, 2.33.5, 2.34.5, 2.35.5, 2.36.3, and 2.37.4 and users
are advised to upgrade to the latest version. Disabling `git shell`
access via remote logins is a viable short-term workaround.

Twig is a template language for PHP. Versions 1.x prior to 1.44.7, 2.x
prior to 2.15.3, and 3.x prior to 3.4.3 encounter an issue when the
filesystem loader loads templates for which the name is a user input.
It is possible to use the `source` or `include` statement to read
arbitrary files from outside the templates' directory when using a
namespace like `@somewhere/../some.file`. In such a case, validation
is bypassed. Versions 1.44.7, 2.15.3, and 3.4.3 contain a fix for
validation of such template names. There are no known workarounds

`@next-auth/upstash-redis-adapter` is the Upstash Redis adapter for
NextAuth.js, which provides authentication for Next.js. Applications
that use `next-auth` Email Provider and `@next-auth/upstash-redis-
adapter` before v3.0.2 are affected by this vulnerability. The Upstash
Redis adapter implementation did not check for both the identifier
(email) and the token, but only checking for the identifier when
verifying the token in the email callback flow. An attacker who knows
about the victim's email could easily sign in as the victim, given the
attacker also knows about the verification token's expired duration.
The vulnerability is patched in v3.0.2. A workaround is available.
Using Advanced Initialization, developers can check the requests and
compare the query's token and identifier before proceeding.

component's settings) are able to inject arbitrary HTML on that
topic's page. The issue has been fixed on the `main` branch. Admins
can update the theme component through the admin UI (Customize ->
Themes -> Components -> DiscoTOC -> Check for Updates). Alternatively,
admins can temporarily disable the DiscoTOC theme component.

Traefik (pronounced traffic) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load
balancer that assists in deploying microservices. There is a potential
vulnerability in Traefik managing HTTP/2 connections. A closing HTTP/2
server connection could hang forever because of a subsequent fatal
error. This failure mode could be exploited to cause a denial of

Flux is an open and extensible continuous delivery solution for
Kubernetes. Versions prior to 0.35.0 are subject to a Denial of
Service. Users that have permissions to change Flux&#8217;s objects, either
through a Flux source or directly within a cluster, can provide
invalid data to fields `.spec.interval` or `.spec.timeout` (and
structured variations of these fields), causing the entire object type
to stop being processed. This issue is patched in version 0.35.0. As a
workaround, Admission controllers can be employed to restrict the
values that can be used for fields `.spec.interval` and
`.spec.timeout`, however upgrading to the latest versions is still the
recommended mitigation.

FlyteAdmin is the control plane for the data processing platform
Flyte. Users who enable the default Flyte&#8217;s authorization server
without changing the default clientid hashes will be exposed to the
public internet. In an effort to make enabling authentication easier
for Flyte administrators, the default configuration for Flyte Admin
allows access for Flyte Propeller even after turning on authentication
via a hardcoded hashed password. This password is also set on the
default Flyte Propeller configmap in the various Flyte Helm charts.
Users who enable auth but do not override this setting in Flyte
Admin&#8217;s configuration may unbeknownst to them be allowing public
traffic in by way of this default password with attackers effectively
impersonating propeller. This only applies to users who have not
specified the ExternalAuthorizationServer setting. Usage of an
external auth server automatically turns off this default
configuration and are not susceptible to this vulnerability. This
issue has been addressed in version 1.1.44. Users should manually set
the staticClients in the selfAuthServer section of their configuration
if they intend to rely on Admin&#8217;s internal auth server. Again, users
who use an external auth server are automatically protected from this
vulnerability.

LoRaMac-node is a reference implementation and documentation of a LoRa
network node. Versions of LoRaMac-node prior to 4.7.0 are vulnerable
to a buffer overflow. Improper size validation of the incoming radio
frames can lead to an 65280-byte out-of-bounds write. The function
`ProcessRadioRxDone` implicitly expects incoming radio frames to have
at least a payload of one byte or more. An empty payload leads to a
1-byte out-of-bounds read of user controlled content when the payload
buffer is reused. This allows an attacker to craft a
FRAME_TYPE_PROPRIETARY frame with size -1 which results in an
65280-byte out-of-bounds memcopy likely with partially controlled
attacker data. Corrupting a large part if the data section is likely
to cause a DoS. If the large out-of-bounds write does not immediately
crash the attacker may gain control over the execution due to now
controlling large parts of the data section. Users are advised to
upgrade either by updating their package or by manually applying the
patch commit `e851b079`.

Istio is an open platform-independent service mesh that provides
traffic management, policy enforcement, and telemetry collection.
Prior to versions 1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9, the Istio control plane,
istiod, is vulnerable to a request processing error, allowing a
malicious attacker that sends a specially crafted or oversized message
which results in the control plane crashing when the Kubernetes
validating or mutating webhook service is exposed publicly. This
endpoint is served over TLS port 15017, but does not require any
authentication from the attacker. For simple installations, Istiod is
typically only reachable from within the cluster, limiting the blast
radius. However, for some deployments, especially external istiod
topologies, this port is exposed over the public internet. Versions
1.15.2, 1.14.5, and 1.13.9 contain patches for this issue. There are
no effective workarounds, beyond upgrading. This bug is due to an
error in `regexp.Compile` in Go.

vulnerability (XSS) by backing out of the current "tr" "td" brackets.
This then allows a malicious user to provide code that will execute
when a user views the specific log on the "view=log" page. This
vulnerability allows an attacker to store code within the logs that
will be executed when loaded by a legitimate user. These actions will
be performed with the permission of the victim. This could lead to
data loss and/or further exploitation including account takeover. This
issue has been addressed in versions `1.36.27` and `1.37.24`. Users
are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable
database logging.

ZoneMinder is a free, open source Closed-circuit television software
application. In affected versions authenticated users can bypass CSRF
keys by modifying the request supplied to the Zoneminder web
application. These modifications include replacing HTTP POST with an
HTTP GET and removing the CSRF key from the request. An attacker can
take advantage of this by using an HTTP GET request to perform actions
with no CSRF protection. This could allow an attacker to cause an
authenticated user to perform unexpected actions on the web
application. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. There
are no known workarounds for this issue.

conduit-hyper integrates a conduit application with the hyper server.
Prior to version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` did not check any limit on a
request's length before calling [`hyper::body::to_bytes`](https://docs
.rs/hyper/latest/hyper/body/fn.to_bytes.html). An attacker could send
a malicious request with an abnormally large `Content-Length`, which
could lead to a panic if memory allocation failed for that request. In
version 0.4.2, `conduit-hyper` sets an internal limit of 128 MiB per
request, otherwise returning status 400 ("Bad Request"). This crate is
part of the implementation of Rust's [crates.io](https://crates.io/),
but that service is not affected due to its existing cloud
infrastructure, which already drops such malicious requests. Even with
the new limit in place, `conduit-hyper` is not recommended for
production use, nor to directly serve the public Internet.

Passport-SAML is a SAML 2.0 authentication provider for Passport, the
Node.js authentication library. A remote attacker may be able to
bypass SAML authentication on a website using passport-saml. A
successful attack requires that the attacker is in possession of an
arbitrary IDP signed XML element. Depending on the IDP used, fully
unauthenticated attacks (e.g without access to a valid user) might
also be feasible if generation of a signed message can be triggered.
Users should upgrade to passport-saml version 3.2.2 or newer. The
issue was also present in the beta releases of `node-saml` before
version 4.0.0-beta.5. If you cannot upgrade, disabling SAML
authentication may be done as a workaround.

ghinstallation provides transport, which implements http.RoundTripper
to provide authentication as an installation for GitHub Apps. In
ghinstallation version 1, when the request to refresh an installation
token failed, the HTTP request and response would be returned for
debugging. The request contained the bearer JWT for the App, and was
returned back to clients. This token is short lived (10 minute
maximum). This issue has been patched and is available in version
2.0.0.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
Versions prior to 9.2.4, or 8.5.15 on the 8.X branch, are subject to
Improper Input Validation. Grafana admins can invite other members to
the organization they are an admin for. When admins add members to the
organization, non existing users get an email invite, existing members
are added directly to the organization. When an invite link is sent,
it allows users to sign up with whatever username/email address the
user chooses and become a member of the organization. This introduces
a vulnerability which can be used with malicious intent. This issue is
patched in version 9.2.4, and has been backported to 8.5.15. There are
no known workarounds.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
When using the forget password on the login page, a POST request is
made to the `/api/user/password/sent-reset-email` URL. When the
username or email does not exist, a JSON response contains a &#8220;user not
found&#8221; message. This leaks information to unauthenticated users and
introduces a security risk. This issue has been patched in 9.2.4 and

GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and
streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of
your product. GoCD versions from 19.2.0 to 19.10.0 (inclusive) are
subject to a timing attack in validation of access tokens due to use
of regular string comparison for validation of the token rather than a
constant time algorithm. This could allow a brute force attack on GoCD
server API calls to observe timing differences in validations in order
to guess an access token generated by a user for API access. This
issue is fixed in GoCD version 19.11.0. As a workaround, users can
apply rate limiting or insert random delays to API calls made to GoCD
Server via a reverse proxy or other fronting web server. Another
workaround, users may disallow use of access tokens by users by having
an administrator revoke all access tokens through the "Access Token
Management" admin function.

GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and
streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of
your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 leak the symmetric key
used to encrypt/decrypt any secure variables/secrets in GoCD
configuration to authenticated agents. A malicious/compromised agent
may then expose that key from memory, and potentially allow an
attacker the ability to decrypt secrets intended for other
agents/environments if they also are able to obtain access to
encrypted configuration values from the GoCD server. This issue is
fixed in GoCD version 21.1.0. There are currently no known

GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and
streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of
your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 can allow one
authenticated agent to impersonate another agent, and thus receive
work packages for other agents due to broken access control and
incorrect validation of agent tokens within the GoCD server. Since
work packages can contain sensitive information such as credentials
intended only for a given job running against a specific agent
environment, this can cause accidental information disclosure.
Exploitation requires knowledge of agent identifiers and ability to
authenticate as an existing agent with the GoCD server. This issue is
fixed in GoCD version 21.1.0. There are currently no known

GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD helps you automate and
streamline the build-test-release cycle for continuous delivery of
your product. GoCD versions prior to 21.1.0 are vulnerable to remote
code execution on the server from a malicious or compromised agent.
The Spring RemoteInvocation endpoint exposed agent communication and
allowed deserialization of arbitrary java objects, as well as
subsequent remote code execution. Exploitation requires agent-level
authentication, thus an attacker would need to either compromise an
existing agent, its network communication or register a new agent to
practically exploit this vulnerability. This issue is fixed in GoCD
version 21.1.0. There are currently no known workarounds.

Dataease is an open source data visualization analysis tool. Dataease
prior to 1.15.2 has a deserialization vulnerability. In Dataease, the
Mysql data source in the data source function can customize the JDBC
connection parameters and the Mysql server target to be connected. In 
`backend/src/main/java/io/dataease/provider/datasource/JdbcProvider.ja
va`, the `MysqlConfiguration` class does not filter any parameters. If
an attacker adds some parameters to a JDBC url and connects to a
malicious mysql server, the attacker can trigger the mysql jdbc
deserialization vulnerability. Through the deserialization
vulnerability, the attacker can execute system commands and obtain
server privileges. Version 1.15.2 contains a patch for this issue.

Kirby is a flat-file CMS. In versions prior to 3.5.8.2, 3.6.6.2,
3.7.5.1, and 3.8.1, Kirby is subject to user enumeration due to
Improper Restriction of Excessive Authentication Attempts. This
vulnerability affects you only if you are using the `code` or
`password-reset` auth method with the `auth.methods` option or if you
have enabled the `debug` option in production. By using two or more IP
addresses and multiple login attempts, valid user accounts will lock,
but invalid accounts will not, leading to account enumeration. This
issue has been patched in versions 3.5.8.2, 3.6.6.2, 3.7.5.1, and
3.8.1. If you cannot update immediately, you can work around the issue
by setting the `auth.methods` option to `password`, which disables the
code-based login and password reset forms.

all Kirby sites with user accounts unless Kirby's API and Panel are
disabled in the config. It can only be exploited for targeted attacks
because the attack does not scale to brute force. The problem has been
patched in Kirby 3.5.8.2, Kirby 3.6.6.2, Kirby 3.7.5.1, and Kirby
3.8.1. In all of the mentioned releases, the maintainers have
rewritten the affected code so that the delay is also inserted after
the brute force limit is reached.

containers alongside untrusted user inputs in environment variables
may be vulnerable. The Actions Runner has been patched, both on
`github.com` and hotfixes for GHES and GHAE customers in versions
2.296.2, 2.293.1, 2.289.4, 2.285.2, and 2.283.4. GHES and GHAE
customers may want to patch their instance in order to have their
runners automatically upgrade to these new runner versions. As a
workaround, users may consider removing any container actions, job
containers, or service containers from their jobs until they are able
to upgrade their runner versions.

Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by
the Matrix.org Foundation. The Matrix Federation API allows remote
homeservers to request the authorization events in a room. This is
necessary so that a homeserver receiving some events can validate that
those events are legitimate and permitted in their room. However, in
versions of Synapse up to and including 1.68.0, a Synapse homeserver
answering a query for authorization events does not sufficiently check
that the requesting server should be able to access them. The issue
was patched in Synapse 1.69.0. Homeserver administrators are advised
to upgrade.

introduce a buffer overflow resulting in overwrite of memory contents.
In particular cases this may allow an attacker to bypass security
features or execute arbitrary code. The implementation of
`ux_device_class_dfu_control_request` function prevents buffer
overflow during handling of DFU UPLOAD command when current state is
`UX_SYSTEM_DFU_STATE_DFU_IDLE`. This issue has been patched, please
upgrade to version 6.1.12. As a workaround, add the `UPLOAD_LENGTH`
check in all possible states.

Twisted is an event-based framework for internet applications. Started
with version 0.9.4, when the host header does not match a configured
host `twisted.web.vhost.NameVirtualHost` will return a `NoResource`
resource which renders the Host header unescaped into the 404 response
allowing HTML and script injection. In practice this should be very
difficult to exploit as being able to modify the Host header of a
normal HTTP request implies that one is already in a privileged
position. This issue was fixed in version 22.10.0rc1. There are no

The Tasks.org Android app is an open-source app for to-do lists and
reminders. The Tasks.org app uses the activity `ShareLinkActivity.kt`
to handle "share" intents coming from other components in the same
device and convert them to tasks. Those intents may contain arbitrary
file paths as attachments, in which case the files pointed by those
paths are copied in the app's external storage directory. Prior to
versions 12.7.1 and 13.0.1, those paths were not validated, allowing a
malicious or compromised application in the same device to force
Tasks.org to copy files from its internal storage to its external
storage directory, where they became accessible to any component with
permission to read the external storage. This vulnerability can lead
to sensitive information disclosure. All information in the user's
notes and the app's preferences, including the encrypted credentials
of CalDav integrations if enabled, could be accessed by third party
applications installed on the same device. This issue was fixed in
versions 12.7.1 and 13.0.1. There are no known workarounds.

@dependencytrack/frontend is a Single Page Application (SPA) used in
Dependency-Track, an open source Component Analysis platform that
allows organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software
supply chain. Due to the common practice of providing vulnerability
details in markdown format, the Dependency-Track frontend renders them
using the JavaScript library Showdown. Showdown does not have any XSS
countermeasures built in, and versions before 4.6.1 of the Dependency-
Track frontend did not encode or sanitize Showdown's output. This made
it possible for arbitrary JavaScript included in vulnerability details
via HTML attributes to be executed in context of the frontend. Actors
with the `VULNERABILITY_MANAGEMENT` permission can exploit this
weakness by creating or editing a custom vulnerability and providing
XSS payloads in any of the following fields: Description, Details,
Recommendation, or References. The payload will be executed for users
with the `VIEW_PORTFOLIO` permission when browsing to the modified
vulnerability's page. Alternatively, malicious JavaScript could be
introduced via any of the vulnerability databases mirrored by
Dependency-Track. However, this attack vector is highly unlikely, and
the maintainers of Dependency-Track are not aware of any occurrence of
this happening. Note that the `Vulnerability Details` element of the
`Audit Vulnerabilities` tab in the project view is not affected. The
issue has been fixed in frontend version 4.6.1.

Dependency-Track is a Component Analysis platform that allows
organizations to identify and reduce risk in the software supply
chain. Prior to version 4.6.0, performing an API request using a valid
API key with insufficient permissions causes the API key to be written
to Dependency-Track's audit log in clear text. Actors with access to
the audit log can exploit this flaw to gain access to valid API keys.
The issue has been fixed in Dependency-Track 4.6.0. Instead of logging
the entire API key, only the last 4 characters of the key will be
logged. It is strongly recommended to check historic logs for
occurrences of this behavior, and re-generating API keys in case of
leakage.

xmldom is a pure JavaScript W3C standard-based (XML DOM Level 2 Core)
`DOMParser` and `XMLSerializer` module. xmldom parses XML that is not
well-formed because it contains multiple top level elements, and adds
all root nodes to the `childNodes` collection of the `Document`,
without reporting any error or throwing. This breaks the assumption
that there is only a single root node in the tree, which led to
issuance of CVE-2022-39299 as it is a potential issue for dependents.
Update to @xmldom/xmldom@~0.7.7, @xmldom/xmldom@~0.8.4 (dist-tag
latest) or @xmldom/xmldom@>=0.9.0-beta.4 (dist-tag next). As a
workaround, please one of the following approaches depending on your
use case: instead of searching for elements in the whole DOM, only
search in the `documentElement`or reject a document with a document
that has more then 1 `childNode`.

SputnikVM, also called evm, is a Rust implementation of Ethereum
Virtual Machine. A custom stateful precompile can use the `is_static`
parameter to determine if the call is executed in a static context
(via `STATICCALL`), and thus decide if stateful operations should be
done. Prior to version 0.36.0, the passed `is_static` parameter was
incorrect -- it was only set to `true` if the call came from a direct
`STATICCALL` opcode. However, once a static call context is entered,
it should stay static. The issue only impacts custom precompiles that
actually uses `is_static`. For those affected, the issue can lead to
possible incorrect state transitions. Version 0.36.0 contains a patch.
There are no known workarounds.

DataHub is an open-source metadata platform. Prior to version 0.8.45,
the `StatelessTokenService` of the DataHub metadata service (GMS) does
not verify the signature of JWT tokens. This allows an attacker to
connect to DataHub instances as any user if Metadata Service
authentication is enabled. This vulnerability occurs because the
`StatelessTokenService` of the Metadata service uses the `parse`
method of `io.jsonwebtoken.JwtParser`, which does not perform a
verification of the cryptographic token signature. This means that
JWTs are accepted regardless of the used algorithm. This issue may
lead to an authentication bypass. Version 0.8.45 contains a patch for
the issue. There are no known workarounds.

QTIWorks is a software suite for standards-based assessment delivery.
Prior to version 1.0-beta15, the QTIWorks Engine allows users to
upload QTI content packages as ZIP files. The ZIP handling code does
not sufficiently check the paths of files contained within ZIP files,
so can insert files into other locations in the filesystem if they are
writable by the process running the QTIWorks Engine. In extreme cases,
this could allow anonymous users to change files in arbitrary
locations in the filesystem. In normal QTIWorks Engine deployments,
the impact is somewhat reduced because the default QTIWorks
configuration does not enable the public demo functionality, so ZIP
files can only be uploaded by users with "instructor" privileges. This
vulnerability is fixed in version 1.0-beta15. There are no database
configuration changes required when upgrading to this version. No
known workarounds for this issue exist.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00007.html

phpCAS is an authentication library that allows PHP applications to
easily authenticate users via a Central Authentication Service (CAS)
server. The phpCAS library uses HTTP headers to determine the service
URL used to validate tickets. This allows an attacker to control the
host header and use a valid ticket granted for any authorized service
in the same SSO realm (CAS server) to authenticate to the service
protected by phpCAS. Depending on the settings of the CAS server
service registry in worst case this may be any other service URL (if
the allowed URLs are configured to "^(https)://.*") or may be strictly
limited to known and authorized services in the same SSO federation if
proper URL service validation is applied. This vulnerability may allow
an attacker to gain access to a victim's account on a vulnerable
CASified service without victim's knowledge, when the victim visits
attacker's website while being logged in to the same CAS server.
phpCAS 1.6.0 is a major version upgrade that starts enforcing service
URL discovery validation, because there is unfortunately no 100% safe
default config to use in PHP. Starting this version, it is required to
pass in an additional service base URL argument when constructing the
client class. For more information, please refer to the upgrading doc.
This vulnerability only impacts the CAS client that the phpCAS library
protects against. The problematic service URL discovery behavior in
phpCAS < 1.6.0 will only be disabled, and thus you are not impacted
from it, if the phpCAS configuration has the following setup: 1.
`phpCAS::setUrl()` is called (a reminder that you have to pass in the
full URL of the current page, rather than your service base URL), and
2. `phpCAS::setCallbackURL()` is called, only when the proxy mode is
enabled. 3. If your PHP's HTTP header input `X-Forwarded-Host`,
`X-Forwarded-Server`, `Host`, `X-Forwarded-Proto`, `X-Forwarded-
Protocol` is sanitized before reaching PHP (by a reverse proxy, for
example), you will not be impacted by this vulnerability either. If
your CAS server service registry is configured to only allow known and
trusted service URLs the severity of the vulnerability is reduced
substantially in its severity since an attacker must be in control of
another authorized service. Otherwise, you should upgrade the library
to get the safe service discovery behavior.

use `NODE_ENV` in your user code to trigger security-sensitive
functionality, you are not impacted by this vulnerability. Any
dependencies that use `NODE_ENV` to trigger particular behaviors
(optimizations, security or otherwise) should still respect your
environment's configured `NODE_ENV` variable. The application's
dependencies, as found in `node_modules` (including
`@keystone-6/core`), are typically not compiled as part of this
process, and thus should be unaffected. We have tested this assumption
by verifying that `NODE_ENV=production yarn keystone start` still uses
secure cookies when using `statelessSessions`. This vulnerability has
been fixed in @keystone-6/core@3.0.2, regression tests have been added
for this vulnerability in #8063.

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract
development. Before version 4.4.1 but after 3.2.0, initializer
functions that are invoked separate from contract creation (the most
prominent example being minimal proxies) may be reentered if they make
an untrusted non-view external call. Once an initializer has finished
running it can never be re-executed. However, an exception put in
place to support multiple inheritance made reentrancy possible in the
scenario described above, breaking the expectation that there is a
single execution. Note that upgradeable proxies are commonly
initialized together with contract creation, where reentrancy is not
feasible, so the impact of this issue is believed to be minor. This
issue has been patched, please upgrade to version 4.4.1. As a
workaround, avoid untrusted external calls during initialization.

Lightning Network Daemon (lnd) is an implementation of a lightning
bitcoin overlay network node. All lnd nodes before version `v0.15.4`
are vulnerable to a block parsing bug that can cause a node to enter a
degraded state once encountered. In this degraded state, nodes can
continue to make payments and forward HTLCs, and close out channels.
Opening channels is prohibited, and also on chain transaction events
will be undetected. This can cause loss of funds if a CSV expiry is
researched during a breach attempt or a CLTV delta expires forgetting
the funds in the HTLC. A patch is available in `lnd` version 0.15.4.
Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may use the
`lncli updatechanpolicy` RPC call to increase their CLTV value to a
very high amount or increase their fee policies. This will prevent
nodes from routing through your node, meaning that no pending HTLCs
can be present.

Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version
2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's implementation of its pooling
instance allocator when the allocator is configured to give
WebAssembly instances a maximum of zero pages of memory. In this
configuration, the virtual memory mapping for WebAssembly memories did
not meet the compiler-required configuration requirements for safely
executing WebAssembly modules. Wasmtime's default settings require
virtual memory page faults to indicate that wasm reads/writes are out-
of-bounds, but the pooling allocator's configuration would not create
an appropriate virtual memory mapping for this meaning out of bounds
reads/writes can successfully read/write memory unrelated to the wasm
sandbox within range of the base address of the memory mapping created
by the pooling allocator. This bug is not applicable with the default
settings of the `wasmtime` crate. This bug can only be triggered by
setting `InstanceLimits::memory_pages` to zero. This is expected to be
a very rare configuration since this means that wasm modules cannot
allocate any pages of linear memory. All wasm modules produced by all
current toolchains are highly likely to use linear memory, so it's
expected to be unlikely that this configuration is set to zero by any
production embedding of Wasmtime. This bug has been patched and users
should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2. This bug can be worked around by
increasing the `memory_pages` allotment when configuring the pooling
allocator to a value greater than zero. If an embedding wishes to
still prevent memory from actually being used then the
`Store::limiter` method can be used to dynamically disallow growth of
memory beyond 0 bytes large. Note that the default `memory_pages`
value is greater than zero.

Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Prior to version
2.0.2, there is a bug in Wasmtime's C API implementation where the
definition of the `wasmtime_trap_code` does not match its declared
signature in the `wasmtime/trap.h` header file. This discrepancy
causes the function implementation to perform a 4-byte write into a
1-byte buffer provided by the caller. This can lead to three zero
bytes being written beyond the 1-byte location provided by the caller.
This bug has been patched and users should upgrade to Wasmtime 2.0.2.
This bug can be worked around by providing a 4-byte buffer casted to a
1-byte buffer when calling `wasmtime_trap_code`. Users of the
`wasmtime` crate are not affected by this issue, only users of the C
API function `wasmtime_trap_code` are affected.

Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux
container technology written in Golang. In Vela Server and Vela Worker
prior to version 0.16.0 and Vela UI prior to version 0.17.0, some
default configurations for Vela allow exploitation and container
breakouts. Users should upgrade to Server 0.16.0, Worker 0.16.0, and
UI 0.17.0 to fix the issue. After upgrading, Vela administrators will
need to explicitly change the default settings to configure Vela as
desired. Some of the fixes will interrupt existing workflows and will
require Vela administrators to modify default settings. However, not
applying the patch (or workarounds) will continue existing risk
exposure. Some workarounds are available. Vela administrators can
adjust the worker's `VELA_RUNTIME_PRIVILEGED_IMAGES` setting to be
explicitly empty, leverage the `VELA_REPO_ALLOWLIST` setting on the
server component to restrict access to a list of repositories that are
allowed to be enabled, and/or audit enabled repositories and disable
