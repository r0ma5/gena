An authentication bypass flaw was found in GRUB due to the way that
GRUB uses the UUID of a device to search for the configuration file
that contains the password hash for the GRUB password protection
feature. An attacker capable of attaching an external drive such as a
USB stick containing a file system with a duplicate UUID (the same as
in the "/boot/" file system) can bypass the GRUB password protection
feature on UEFI systems, which enumerate removable drives before non-
removable ones. This issue was introduced in a downstream patch in Red
Hat's version of grub2 and does not affect the upstream package.

uthenticode is a small cross-platform library for partially verifying
Authenticode digital signatures. Versions of uthenticode prior to the
2.x series did not check Extended Key Usages in certificates, in
violation of the Authenticode X.509 certificate profile. As a result,
a malicious user could produce a "signed" PE file that uthenticode
would verify and consider valid using an X.509 certificate that isn't
entitled to produce code signatures (e.g., a SSL certificate). By
design, uthenticode does not perform full-chain validation. However,
the absence of EKU validation was an unintended oversight. The 2.0.0
release series includes EKU checks. There are no workarounds to this
vulnerability.

SVG Loader is a javascript library that fetches SVGs using
XMLHttpRequests and injects the SVG code in the tag's place. According
to the docs, svg-loader will strip all JS code before injecting the
SVG file for security reasons but the input sanitization logic is not
sufficient and can be trivially bypassed. This allows an attacker to
craft a malicious SVG which can result in Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
When trying to sanitize the svg the lib removes event attributes such
as `onmouseover`, `onclick` but the list of events is not exhaustive.
Any website which uses external-svg-loader and allows its users to
provide svg src, upload svg files would be susceptible to stored XSS
attack. This issue has been addressed in commit `d3562fc08` which is
included in releases from 1.6.9. Users are advised to upgrade. There
are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract
development. Starting in version 4.0.0 and prior to version 4.9.3,
contracts using `ERC2771Context` along with a custom trusted forwarder
may see `_msgSender` return `address(0)` in calls that originate from
the forwarder with calldata shorter than 20 bytes. This combination of
circumstances does not appear to be common, in particular it is not
the case for `MinimalForwarder` from OpenZeppelin Contracts, or any
deployed forwarder the team is aware of, given that the signer address
is appended to all calls that originate from these forwarders. The
problem has been patched in v4.9.3.

Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language. For the following
(probably non-exhaustive) list of expressions, the compiler evaluates
the arguments from right to left instead of left to right.
`unsafe_add, unsafe_sub, unsafe_mul, unsafe_div, pow_mod256, |, &, ^
(bitwise operators), bitwise_or (deprecated), bitwise_and
(deprecated), bitwise_xor (deprecated), raw_call, <, >, <=, >=, ==,
!=, in, not in (when lhs and rhs are enums)`. This behaviour becomes a
problem when the evaluation of one of the arguments produces side
effects that other arguments depend on. The following expressions can
produce side-effect: state modifying external call , state modifying
internal call, `raw_call`, `pop()` when used on a Dynamic Array stored
in the storage, `create_minimal_proxy_to`, `create_copy_of`,
`create_from_blueprint`. This issue has not yet been patched. Users
are advised to make sure that the arguments of the expression do not
produce side effects or, if one does, that no other argument is
dependent on those side effects.

FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital
transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software
implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version
1.10.10, FreeSWITCH allows remote users to trigger out of bounds write
by offering an ICE candidate with unknown component ID. When an SDP is
offered with any ICE candidates with an unknown component ID,
FreeSWITCH will make an out of bounds write to its arrays. By abusing
this vulnerability, an attacker is able to corrupt FreeSWITCH memory

FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital
transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software
implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version
1.10.10, FreeSWITCH allows authorized users to cause a denial of
service attack by sending re-INVITE with SDP containing duplicate
codec names. When a call in FreeSWITCH completes codec negotiation,
the `codec_string` channel variable is set with the result of the
negotiation. On a subsequent re-negotiation, if an SDP is offered that
contains codecs with the same names but with different formats, there
may be too many codec matches detected by FreeSWITCH leading to
overflows of its internal arrays. By abusing this vulnerability, an
attacker is able to corrupt stack of FreeSWITCH leading to an
undefined behavior of the system or simply crash it. Version 1.10.10

Oppia is an online learning platform. When comparing a received CSRF
token against the expected token, Oppia uses the string equality
operator (`==`), which is not safe against timing attacks. By
repeatedly submitting invalid tokens, an attacker can brute-force the
expected CSRF token character by character. Once they have recovered
the token, they can then submit a forged request on behalf of a
logged-in user and execute privileged actions on that user's behalf.
In particular the function to validate received CSRF tokens is at
`oppia.core.controllers.base.CsrfTokenManager.is_csrf_token_valid`. An
attacker who can lure a logged-in Oppia user to a malicious website
can perform any change on Oppia that the user is authorized to do,
including changing profile information; creating, deleting, and
changing explorations; etc. Note that the attacker cannot change a
user's login credentials. An attack would need to complete within 1
second because every second, the time used in computing the token
changes. This issue has been addressed in commit `b89bf80837` which
has been included in release `3.3.2-hotfix-2`. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Rizin is a UNIX-like reverse engineering framework and command-line
toolset. Versions 0.6.0 and prior are vulnerable to integer overflow
in `consume_count` of `src/gnu_v2/cplus-dem.c`. The overflow check is
valid logic but, is missing the modulus if the block once compiled.
The compiler sees this block as unreachable code since the prior
statement is multiplication by 10 and fails to consider overflow
assuming the count will always be a multiple of 10. Rizin version
0.6.1 contains a fix for the issue. A temporary workaround would be
disabling C++ demangling using the configuration option
`bin.demangle=false`.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. All versions of Argo CD starting from version 2.6.0 have a
bug where open web terminal sessions do not expire. This bug allows
users to send any websocket messages even if the token has already
expired. The most straightforward scenario is when a user opens the
terminal view and leaves it open for an extended period. This allows
the user to view sensitive information even when they should have been
logged out already. A patch for this vulnerability has been released
in the following Argo CD versions: 2.6.14, 2.7.12 and 2.8.1.

Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment framework for
Kubernetes. In Argo CD versions prior to 2.3 (starting at least in
v0.1.0, but likely in any version using Helm before 2.3), using a
specifically-crafted Helm file could reference external Helm charts
handled by the same repo-server to leak values, or files from the
referenced Helm Chart. This was possible because Helm paths were
predictable. The vulnerability worked by adding a Helm chart that
referenced Helm resources from predictable paths. Because the paths of
Helm charts were predictable and available on an instance of repo-
server, it was possible to reference and then render the values and
resources from other existing Helm charts regardless of permissions.
While generally, secrets are not stored in these files, it was
nevertheless possible to reference any values from these charts. This
issue was fixed in Argo CD 2.3 and subsequent versions by randomizing
Helm paths. User's still using Argo CD 2.3 or below are advised to
update to a supported version. If this is not possible, disabling Helm
chart rendering, or using an additional repo-server for each Helm
chart would prevent possible exploitation.

Keystone is an open source headless CMS for Node.js &#8212; built with
GraphQL and React. When `ui.isAccessAllowed` is set as `undefined`,
the `adminMeta` GraphQL query is publicly accessible (no session
required). This is different to the behaviour of the default AdminUI
middleware, which by default will only be publicly accessible (no
session required) if a `session` strategy is not defined. This
vulnerability does not affect developers using the `@keystone-6/auth`
package, or any users that have written their own `ui.isAccessAllowed`
(that is to say, `isAccessAllowed` is not `undefined`). This
vulnerability does affect users who believed that their `session`
strategy will, by default, enforce that `adminMeta` is inaccessible by
the public in accordance with that strategy; akin to the behaviour of
the AdminUI middleware. This vulnerability has been patched in
`@keystone-6/core` version `5.5.1`. Users are advised to upgrade.
Users unable to upgrade may opt to write their own `isAccessAllowed`
functionality to work-around this vulnerability.

Cluster secrets might be managed declaratively using Argo CD / kubectl
apply. As a result, the full secret body is stored
in`kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation. pull
request #7139 introduced the ability to manage cluster labels and
annotations. Since clusters are stored as secrets it also exposes the
`kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration` annotation which

via the Argo CD API, the user must have `clusters, get` RBAC access.
**Note:** In many cases, cluster secrets do not contain any actually-
secret information. But sometimes, as in bearer-token auth, the
contents might be very sensitive. The bug has been patched in versions
2.8.3, 2.7.14, and 2.6.15. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
to upgrade should update/deploy cluster secret with `server-side-

Cargo downloads a Rust project&#8217;s dependencies and compiles the
project. Starting in Rust 1.60.0 and prior to 1.72, Cargo did not
escape Cargo feature names when including them in the report generated
by `cargo build --timings`. A malicious package included as a
dependency may inject nearly arbitrary HTML here, potentially leading
to cross-site scripting if the report is subsequently uploaded
somewhere. The vulnerability affects users relying on dependencies
from git, local paths, or alternative registries. Users who solely
depend on crates.io are unaffected. Rust 1.60.0 introduced `cargo
build --timings`, which produces a report of how long the different
steps of the build process took. It includes lists of Cargo features
for each crate. Prior to Rust 1.72, Cargo feature names were allowed
to contain almost any characters (with some exceptions as used by the
feature syntax), but it would produce a future incompatibility warning
about them since Rust 1.49. crates.io is far more stringent about what
it considers a valid feature name and has not allowed such feature
names. As the feature names were included unescaped in the timings
report, they could be used to inject Javascript into the page, for
example with a feature name like `features = ["<img src=''
onerror=alert(0)"]`. If this report were subsequently uploaded to a
domain that uses credentials, the injected Javascript could access
resources from the website visitor. This issue was fixed in Rust 1.72
by turning the future incompatibility warning into an error. Users
should still exercise care in which package they download, by only
including trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that
even with these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows
arbitrary code execution at build time thanks to build scripts and
procedural macros: a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage
regardless of these vulnerabilities. crates.io has server-side checks
preventing this attack, and there are no packages on crates.io
exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need to
excercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code
execution is allowed by design there as well.

libvips is a demand-driven, horizontally threaded image processing
library. A specially crafted SVG input can cause libvips versions
8.14.3 or earlier to segfault when attempting to parse a malformed
UTF-8 character. Users should upgrade to libvips version 8.14.4 (or
later) when processing untrusted input.

Flarum is an open source forum software. Flarum is affected by a
vulnerability that allows an attacker to conduct a Blind Server-Side
Request Forgery (SSRF) attack or disclose any file on the server, even
with a basic user account on any Flarum forum. By uploading a file
containing a URL and spoofing the MIME type, an attacker can
manipulate the application to execute unintended actions. The
vulnerability is due to the behavior of the `intervention/image`
package, which attempts to interpret the supplied file contents as a
URL, which then fetches its contents. This allows an attacker to
exploit the vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks, disclose local file
contents, or conduct a blind oracle attack. This has been patched in
Flarum version 1.8.0. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
upgrade may disable PHP's `allow_url_fopen` which will prevent the
fetching of external files via URLs as a temporary workaround for the
SSRF aspect of the vulnerability.

Woodpecker is a community fork of the Drone CI system. In affected
versions an attacker can post malformed webhook data witch lead to an
update of the repository data that can e.g. allow the takeover of an
repo. This is only critical if the CI is configured for public usage
and connected to a forge witch is also in public usage. This issue has
been addressed in version 1.0.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
unable to upgrade should secure the CI system by making it
inaccessible to untrusted entities, for example, by placing it behind
a firewall.

Craft is a CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and
beyond. Bypassing the validatePath function can lead to potential
remote code execution. This vulnerability can lead to malicious
control of vulnerable systems and data exfiltrations. Although the
vulnerability is exploitable only in the authenticated users,
configuration with ALLOW_ADMIN_CHANGES=true, there is still a
potential security threat (Remote Code Execution). This issue has been
patched in version 4.4.15 and version 3.8.15.

rubygems.org is the Ruby community's primary gem (library) hosting
service. Insufficient input validation allowed malicious actors to
replace any uploaded gem version that had a platform, version number,
or gem name matching `/-\d/`, permanently replacing the legitimate
upload in the canonical gem storage bucket, and triggering an
immediate CDN purge so that the malicious gem would be served
immediately. The maintainers have checked all gems matching the
`/-\d/` pattern and can confirm that no unexpected `.gem`s were found.
As a result, we believe this vulnerability was _not_ exploited. The
easiest way to ensure that a user's applications were not exploited by
this vulnerability is to check that all of your downloaded .gems have
a checksum that matches the checksum recorded in the RubyGems.org
database. RubyGems contributor Maciej Mensfeld wrote a tool to
automatically check that all downloaded .gem files match the checksums
recorded in the RubyGems.org database. You can use it by running:
`bundle add bundler-integrity` followed by `bundle exec bundler-
integrity`. Neither this tool nor anything else can prove you were not
exploited, but the can assist your investigation by quickly comparing
RubyGems API-provided checksums with the checksums of files on your
disk. The issue has been patched with improved input validation and
the changes are live. No action is required on the part of the user.
Users are advised to validate their local gems.

Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Prior to versions
9.4.52, 10.0.16, 11.0.16, and 12.0.1, Jetty accepts the `+` character
proceeding the content-length value in a HTTP/1 header field. This is
more permissive than allowed by the RFC and other servers routinely
reject such requests with 400 responses. There is no known exploit
scenario, but it is conceivable that request smuggling could result if
jetty is used in combination with a server that does not close the
connection after sending such a 400 response. Versions 9.4.52,
10.0.16, 11.0.16, and 12.0.1 contain a patch for this issue. There is
no workaround as there is no known exploit scenario.

TurboWarp is a desktop application that compiles scratch projects to
JavaScript. TurboWarp Desktop versions prior to version 1.8.0 allowed
a malicious project or custom extension to read arbitrary files from
disk and upload them to a remote server. The only required user
interaction is opening the sb3 file or loading the extension. The web
version of TurboWarp is not affected. This bug has been addressed in
commit `55e07e99b59` after an initial fix which was reverted. Users
are advised to upgrade to version 1.8.0 or later. Users unable to
upgrade should avoid opening sb3 files or loading extensions from
untrusted sources.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. Any registered user can exploit a
stored XSS through their user profile by setting the payload as the
value of the time zone user preference. Even though the time zone is
selected from a drop down (no free text value) it can still be set
from JavaScript (using the browser developer tools) or by calling the
save URL on the user profile with the right query string. Once the
time zone is set it is displayed without escaping which means the
payload gets executed for any user that visits the malicious user
profile, allowing the attacker to steal information and even gain more
access rights (escalation to programming rights). This issue is
present since version 4.1M2 when the time zone user preference was
introduced. The issue has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and 15.1RC1.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. Any registered user can use the
content field of their user profile page to execute arbitrary scripts
with programming rights, thus effectively performing rights
escalation. This issue is present since version 4.3M2 when
AppWithinMinutes Application added support for the Content field,
allowing any wiki page (including the user profile page) to use its
content as an AWM Content field, which has a custom displayer that
executes the content with the rights of the
``AppWithinMinutes.Content`` author, rather than the rights of the
content author. The vulnerability has been fixed in XWiki 14.10.5 and
15.1RC1. The fix is in the content of the AppWithinMinutes.Content
page that defines the custom displayer. By using the ``display``
script service to render the content we make sure that the proper
author is used for access rights checks.

silverstripe-graphql is a package which serves Silverstripe data in
GraphQL representations. An attacker could use a recursive graphql
query to execute a Distributed Denial of Service attack (DDOS attack)
against a website. This mostly affects websites with publicly exposed
graphql schemas. If your Silverstripe CMS project does not expose a
public facing graphql schema, a user account is required to trigger
the DDOS attack. If your site is hosted behind a content delivery
network (CDN), such as Imperva or CloudFlare, this may further
mitigate the risk. This issue has been addressed in versions 3.8.2,
4.1.3, 4.2.5, 4.3.4, and 5.0.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There
are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

DataEase is an open source data visualization and analysis tool. Prior
to version 1.18.11, DataEase has a vulnerability that allows an
attacker to to obtain user cookies. The program only uses the
`ImageIO.read()` method to determine whether the file is an image file
or not. There is no whitelisting restriction on file suffixes. This
allows the attacker to synthesize the attack code into an image for
uploading and change the file extension to html. The attacker may
steal user cookies by accessing links. The vulnerability has been
fixed in v1.18.11. There are no known workarounds.

xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol (RDP) server. In
versions prior to 0.9.23 improper handling of session establishment
errors allows bypassing OS-level session restrictions. The
`auth_start_session` function can return non-zero (1) value on, e.g.,
PAM error which may result in in session restrictions such as max
concurrent sessions per user by PAM (ex ./etc/security/limits.conf) to
be bypassed. Users (administrators) don't use restrictions by PAM are
not affected. This issue has been addressed in release version 0.9.23.
Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
issue.

branch are subject to a Use-After-Free issue in the
`avc420_ensure_buffer` and `avc444_ensure_buffer` functions. If the
value of `piDstSize[x]` is 0, `ppYUVDstData[x]` will be freed.
However, in this case `ppYUVDstData[x]` will not have been updated

An issue was discovered in Python before 3.8.18, 3.9.x before 3.9.18,
3.10.x before 3.10.13, and 3.11.x before 3.11.5. It primarily affects
servers (such as HTTP servers) that use TLS client authentication. If
a TLS server-side socket is created, receives data into the socket
buffer, and then is closed quickly, there is a brief window where the
SSLSocket instance will detect the socket as "not connected" and won't
initiate a handshake, but buffered data will still be readable from
the socket buffer. This data will not be authenticated if the server-
side TLS peer is expecting client certificate authentication, and is
indistinguishable from valid TLS stream data. Data is limited in size
to the amount that will fit in the buffer. (The TLS connection cannot
directly be used for data exfiltration because the vulnerable code
path requires that the connection be closed on initialization of the
SSLSocket.)

A vulnerability was discovered in Veritas NetBackup Snapshot Manager
before 10.2.0.1 that allowed untrusted clients to interact with the
RabbitMQ service. This was caused by improper validation of the client
certificate due to misconfiguration of the RabbitMQ service.
Exploiting this impacts the confidentiality and integrity of messages
controlling the backup and restore jobs, and could result in the
service becoming unavailable. This impacts only the jobs controlling
the backup and restore activities, and does not allow access to (or
deletion of) the backup snapshot data itself. This vulnerability is
confined to the NetBackup Snapshot Manager feature and does not impact
the RabbitMQ instance on the NetBackup primary servers.

EmpowerID before 7.205.0.1 allows an attacker to bypass an MFA (multi
factor authentication) requirement if the first factor (username and

Associated Data Chacha20-Poly1305 algorithm is used, with the single-

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/18/1

Apache Airflow Spark Provider, versions before 4.1.3, is affected by a
vulnerability that allows an attacker to pass in malicious parameters
when establishing a connection giving an opportunity to read files on
the Airflow server. It is recommended to upgrade to a version that is
not affected.

Reference: URL:https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/08/23/1

The session fixation vulnerability allowed the authenticated user to
continue accessing Airflow webserver even after the password of the
user has been reset by the admin - up until the expiry of the session
of the user. Other than manually cleaning the session database (for
database session backend), or changing the secure_key and restarting
the webserver, there were no mechanisms to force-logout the user (and
all other users with that). With this fix implemented, when using the
database session backend, the existing sessions of the user are
invalidated when the password of the user is reset. When using the
securecookie session backend, the sessions are NOT invalidated and
still require changing the secure key and restarting the webserver
(and logging out all other users), but the user resetting the password
is informed about it with a flash message warning displayed in the UI.
Documentation is also updated explaining this behaviour. Users of
Apache Airflow are advised to upgrade to version 2.7.0 or newer to
mitigate the risk associated with this vulnerability.

An issue was discovered in zola 0.13.0 through 0.17.2. The custom
implementation of a web server, available via the "zola serve"
command, allows directory traversal. The handle_request function, used

of special path control characters (../) in the URL when serving a

arbitrary files from the filesystem.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20231230 Re: inetutils ftpd, rcp, rlogin, rsh, rshd, uucpd: Avoid potential privilege escalations by checking set*id() return values
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/30/4

GNU inetutils before 2.5 may allow privilege escalation because of
unchecked return values of set*id() family functions in ftpd, rcp,
rlogin, rsh, rshd, and uucpd. This is, for example, relevant if the
setuid system call fails when a process is trying to drop privileges
before letting an ordinary user control the activities of the process.

**DISPUTED**A failure in the -fstack-protector feature in GCC-based
toolchains that target AArch64 allows an attacker to exploit an
existing buffer overflow in dynamically-sized local variables in your
application without this being detected. This stack-protector failure
only applies to C99-style dynamically-sized local variables or those
created using alloca(). The stack-protector operates as intended for
statically-sized local variables. The default behavior when the stack-
protector detects an overflow is to terminate your application,
resulting in controlled loss of availability. An attacker who can
exploit a buffer overflow without triggering the stack-protector might
be able to change program flow control to cause an uncontrolled loss
of availability or to go further and affect confidentiality or
integrity. NOTE: The GCC project argues that this is a missed
hardening bug and not a vulnerability by itself.

In Eclipse Parsson before versions 1.1.4 and 1.0.5, Parsing JSON from
untrusted sources can lead malicious actors to exploit the fact that
the built-in support for parsing numbers with large scale in Java has
a number of edge cases where the input text of a number can lead to
much larger processing time than one would expect. To mitigate the
risk, parsson put in place a size limit for the numbers as well as
their scale.

The Firefox updater created a directory writable by non-privileged
users. When uninstalling Firefox, any files in that directory would be
recursively deleted with the permissions of the uninstalling user
account. This could be combined with creation of a junction (a form of
symbolic link) to allow arbitrary file deletion controlled by the non-
privileged user. *This bug only affects Firefox on Windows. Other
operating systems are unaffected.* This vulnerability affects Firefox
< 116, Firefox ESR < 115.1, and Thunderbird < 115.1.

Datasette is an open source multi-tool for exploring and publishing
data. This bug affects Datasette instances running a Datasette 1.0
alpha - 1.0a0, 1.0a1, 1.0a2 or 1.0a3 - in an online accessible
location but with authentication enabled using a plugin such as
datasette-auth-passwords. The `/-/api` API explorer endpoint could
reveal the names of both databases and tables - but not their contents
- to an unauthenticated user. Datasette 1.0a4 has a fix for this
issue. This will block access to the API explorer but will still allow
access to the Datasette read or write JSON APIs, as those use
different URL patterns within the Datasette `/database` hierarchy.
This issue is patched in version 1.0a4.

weblogic-framework is a tool for detecting weblogic vulnerabilities.
Versions 0.2.3 and prior do not verify the returned data packets, and
there is a deserialization vulnerability which may lead to remote code
execution. When weblogic-framework gets the command echo, it directly
deserializes the data returned by the server without verifying it. At
the same time, the classloader loads a lot of deserialization calls.
In this case, the malicious serialized data returned by the server
will cause remote code execution. Version 0.2.4 contains a patch for
this issue.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. The create action is vulnerable
to a CSRF attack, allowing script and thus remote code execution when
targeting a user with script/programming right, thus compromising the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of the whole XWiki
installation. When a user with script right views this image and a log
message `ERROR foo - Script executed!` appears in the log, the XWiki
installation is vulnerable. This has been patched in XWiki 14.10.9 and
15.4RC1 by requiring a CSRF token for the actual page creation.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. XWiki supports scheduled jobs
that contain Groovy scripts. Currently, the job checks the content
author of the job for programming right. However, modifying or adding
a job script to a document doesn't modify the content author. Together
with a CSRF vulnerability in the job scheduler, this can be exploited
for remote code execution by an attacker with edit right on the wiki.
If the attack is successful, an error log entry with "Job content
executed" will be produced. This vulnerability has been patched in
XWiki 14.10.9 and 15.4RC1.

yt-dlp is a youtube-dl fork with additional features and fixes. yt-dlp
allows the user to provide shell command lines to be executed at
various stages in its download steps through the `--exec` flag. This
flag allows output template expansion in its argument, so that
metadata values may be used in the shell commands. The metadata fields
can be combined with the `%q` conversion, which is intended to
quote/escape these values so they can be safely passed to the shell.
However, the escaping used for `cmd` (the shell used by Python's
`subprocess` on Windows) does not properly escape special characters,
which can allow for remote code execution if `--exec` is used directly
with maliciously crafted remote data. This vulnerability only impacts
`yt-dlp` on Windows, and the vulnerability is present regardless of
whether `yt-dlp` is run from `cmd` or from `PowerShell`. Support for
output template expansion in `--exec`, along with this vulnerable
behavior, was added to `yt-dlp` in version 2021.04.11. yt-dlp version
2023.09.24 fixes this issue by properly escaping each special
character. `\n` will be replaced by `\r` as no way of escaping it has
been found. It is recommended to upgrade yt-dlp to version 2023.09.24
as soon as possible. Also, always be careful when using --exec,
because while this specific vulnerability has been patched, using
unvalidated input in shell commands is inherently dangerous. For
Windows users who are not able to upgrade: 1. Avoid using any output
template expansion in --exec other than {} (filepath). 2. If expansion
in --exec is needed, verify the fields you are using do not contain ",
| or &. 3. Instead of using --exec, write the info json and load the
fields from it instead.

libp2p is a networking stack and library modularized out of The IPFS
Project, and bundled separately for other tools to use. In go-libp2p,
by using signed peer records a malicious actor can store an arbitrary
amount of data in a remote node&#8217;s memory. This memory does not get
garbage collected and so the victim can run out of memory and crash.
If users of go-libp2p in production are not monitoring memory
consumption over time, it could be a silent attack i.e. the attacker
could bring down nodes over a period of time (how long depends on the
node resources i.e. a go-libp2p node on a virtual server with 4 gb of
memory takes about 90 sec to bring down; on a larger server, it might
take a bit longer.) This issue was patched in version 0.27.4.

Argo CD is a declarative continuous deployment for Kubernetes. All
versions of ArgoCD starting from v2.4 have a bug where the ArgoCD
repo-server component is vulnerable to a Denial-of-Service attack
vector. Specifically, the said component extracts a user-controlled
tar.gz file without validating the size of its inner files. As a
result, a malicious, low-privileged user can send a malicious tar.gz
file that exploits this vulnerability to the repo-server, thereby
harming the system's functionality and availability. Additionally, the
repo-server is susceptible to another vulnerability due to the fact
that it does not check the extracted file permissions before
attempting to delete them. Consequently, an attacker can craft a
malicious tar.gz archive in a way that prevents the deletion of its
inner files when the manifest generation process is completed. A patch
for this vulnerability has been released in versions 2.6.15, 2.7.14,
and 2.8.3. Users are advised to upgrade. The only way to completely
resolve the issue is to upgrade, however users unable to upgrade
should configure RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) and provide access
for configuring applications only to a limited number of
administrators. These administrators should utilize trusted and
verified Helm charts.

ironic-image is a container image to run OpenStack Ironic as part of
Metal. Prior to version capm3-v1.4.3, if Ironic is not deployed with
TLS and it does not have API and Conductor split into separate
services, access to the API is not protected by any authentication.
Ironic API is also listening in host network. In case the node is not
behind a firewall, the API could be accessed by anyone via network
without authentication. By default, Ironic API in Metal3 is protected
by TLS and basic authentication, so this vulnerability requires
operator to configure API without TLS for it to be vulnerable. TLS and
authentication however should not be coupled as they are in versions
prior to capm3-v1.4.3. A patch exists in versions capm3-v1.4.3 and
newer. Some workarounds are available. Either configure TLS for Ironic
API (`deploy.sh -t ...`, `IRONIC_TLS_SETUP=true`) or split Ironic API
and Conductor via configuration change (old implementation, not
recommended). With both workarounds, services are configured with
httpd front-end, which has proper authentication configuration in
place.

Pyramid is an open source Python web framework. A path traversal
vulnerability in Pyramid versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 impacts users of
Python 3.11 that are using a Pyramid static view with a full
filesystem path and have a `index.html` file that is located exactly
one directory above the location of the static view's file system
path. No further path traversal exists, and the only file that could
be disclosed accidentally is `index.html`. Pyramid version 2.0.2
rejects any path that contains a null-byte out of caution. While valid
in directory/file names, we would strongly consider it a mistake to
use null-bytes in naming files/directories. Secondly, Python 3.11, and
3.12 has fixed the underlying issue in `os.path.normpath` to no longer
truncate on the first `0x00` found, returning the behavior to pre-3.11
Python, un an as of yet unreleased version. Fixes will be available
in:Python 3.12.0rc2 and 3.11.5. Some workarounds are available. Use a
version of Python 3 that is not affected, downgrade to Python 3.10
series temporarily, or wait until Python 3.11.5 is released and
upgrade to the latest version of Python 3.11 series.

GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories.
When resolving a program, Python/Windows look for the current working
directory, and after that the PATH environment. GitPython defaults to
use the `git` command, if a user runs GitPython from a repo has a
`git.exe` or `git` executable, that program will be run instead of the
one in the user's `PATH`. This is more of a problem on how Python
interacts with Windows systems, Linux and any other OS aren't affected
by this. But probably people using GitPython usually run it from the
CWD of a repo. An attacker can trick a user to download a repository
with a malicious `git` executable, if the user runs/imports GitPython
from that directory, it allows the attacker to run any arbitrary
commands. There is no fix currently available for windows users,
however there are a few mitigations. 1: Default to an absolute path
for the git program on Windows, like `C:\\Program
Files\\Git\\cmd\\git.EXE` (default git path installation). 2: Require
users to set the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` environment variable on
Windows systems. 3: Make this problem prominent in the documentation
and advise users to never run GitPython from an untrusted repo, or set
the `GIT_PYTHON_GIT_EXECUTABLE` env var to an absolute path. 4:
Resolve the executable manually by only looking into the `PATH`
environment variable.

A flaw was found in OpenSC packages that allow a potential PIN bypass.
When a token/card is authenticated by one process, it can perform
cryptographic operations in other processes when an empty zero-length
pin is passed. This issue poses a security risk, particularly for OS
logon/screen unlock and for small, permanently connected tokens to
computers. Additionally, the token can internally track login status.
This flaw allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access, carry out
malicious actions, or compromise the system without the user's
awareness.

Several memory vulnerabilities were identified within the OpenSC
packages, particularly in the card enrollment process using
pkcs15-init when a user or administrator enrolls cards. To take
advantage of these flaws, an attacker must have physical access to the
computer system and employ a custom-crafted USB device or smart card
to manipulate responses to APDUs. This manipulation can potentially
allow compromise key generation, certificate loading, and other card
management operations during enrollment.

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** When integrating Apache Axis 1.x in an
application, it may not have been obvious that looking up a service
through "ServiceFactory.getService" allows potentially dangerous
lookup mechanisms such as LDAP. When passing untrusted input to this
API method, this could expose the application to DoS, SSRF and even
attacks leading to RCE. As Axis 1 has been EOL we recommend you
migrate to a different SOAP engine, such as Apache Axis 2/Java. As a
workaround, you may review your code to verify no untrusted or
unsanitized input is passed to "ServiceFactory.getService", or by
applying the patch from https://github.com/apache/axis-
axis1-java/commit/7e66753427466590d6def0125e448d2791723210 . The
Apache Axis project does not expect to create an Axis 1.x release
fixing this problem, though contributors that would like to work
towards this are welcome.

A vulnerability was discovered in Samba, where the flaw allows SMB
clients to truncate files, even with read-only permissions when the
Samba VFS module "acl_xattr" is configured with "acl_xattr:ignore
system acls = yes". The SMB protocol allows opening files when the
client requests read-only access but then implicitly truncates the
opened file to 0 bytes if the client specifies a separate OVERWRITE
create disposition request. The issue arises in configurations that
bypass kernel file system permissions checks, relying solely on
Samba's permissions.

`DefaultDDFFileValidator` (and so `ObjectLoader`) are vulnerable to
`XXE Attacks`. A DDF file is a LWM2M format used to store LWM2M object
description. Leshan users are impacted only if they parse untrusted
DDF files (e.g. if they let external users provide their own model),
in that case they MUST upgrade to fixed version. If you parse only
trusted DDF file and validate only with trusted xml schema, upgrading
is not mandatory. This issue has been fixed in versions 1.5.0 and

Macvim is a text editor for MacOS. Prior to version 178, Macvim makes
use of an insecure interprocess communication (IPC) mechanism which
could lead to a privilege escalation. Distributed objects are a
concept introduced by Apple which allow one program to vend an
interface to another program. What is not made clear in the
documentation is that this service can vend this interface to any
other program on the machine. The impact of exploitation is a
privilege escalation to root - this is likely to affect anyone who is
not careful about the software they download and use MacVim to edit
files that would require root privileges. Version 178 contains a fix
for this issue.

OpenPGP.js is a JavaScript implementation of the OpenPGP protocol. In
affected versions OpenPGP Cleartext Signed Messages are
cryptographically signed messages where the signed text is readable
without special tools. These messages typically contain a "Hash: ..."
header declaring the hash algorithm used to compute the signature
digest. OpenPGP.js up to v5.9.0 ignored any data preceding the "Hash:
..." texts when verifying the signature. As a result, malicious
parties could add arbitrary text to a third-party Cleartext Signed
Message, to lead the victim to believe that the arbitrary text was
signed. A user or application is vulnerable to said attack vector if
it verifies the CleartextMessage by only checking the returned
`verified` property, discarding the associated `data` information, and
instead _visually trusting_ the contents of the original message.
Since `verificationResult.data` would always contain the actual signed
data, users and apps that check this information are not vulnerable.
Similarly, given a CleartextMessage object, retrieving the data using
`getText()` or the `text` field returns only the contents that are
considered when verifying the signature. Finally, re-armoring a
CleartextMessage object (using `armor()` will also result in a
"sanitised" version, with the extraneous text being removed. This
issue has been addressed in version 5.10.1 (current stable version)
which will reject messages when calling
`openpgp.readCleartextMessage()` and in version 4.10.11 (legacy
version) which will will reject messages when calling
`openpgp.cleartext.readArmored()`. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
unable to upgrade should check the contents of
`verificationResult.data` to see what data was actually signed, rather
than visually trusting the contents of the armored message.

RestrictedPython is a restricted execution environment for Python to
run untrusted code. Python's "format" functionality allows someone
controlling the format string to "read" all objects accessible through
recursive attribute lookup and subscription from objects he can
access. This can lead to critical information disclosure. With
`RestrictedPython`, the format functionality is available via the
`format` and `format_map` methods of `str` (and `unicode`) (accessed
either via the class or its instances) and via `string.Formatter`. All
known versions of `RestrictedPython` are vulnerable. This issue has
been addressed in commit `4134aedcff1` which has been included in the
5.4 and 6.2 releases. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories.
In order to resolve some git references, GitPython reads files from
the `.git` directory, in some places the name of the file being read
is provided by the user, GitPython doesn't check if this file is
located outside the `.git` directory. This allows an attacker to make
GitPython read any file from the system. This vulnerability is present
in https://github.com/gitpython-developers/GitPython/blob/1c8310d7cae1
44f74a671cbe17e51f63a830adbf/git/refs/symbolic.py#L174-L175. That code
joins the base directory with a user given string without checking if
the final path is located outside the base directory. This
vulnerability cannot be used to read the contents of files but could
in theory be used to trigger a denial of service for the program. This
issue has not yet been addressed.

Graylog is a free and open log management platform. In a multi-node
Graylog cluster, after a user has explicitly logged out, a user
session may still be used for API requests until it has reached its
original expiry time. Each node maintains an in-memory cache of user
sessions. Upon a cache-miss, the session is loaded from the database.
After that, the node operates solely on the cached session.
Modifications to sessions will update the cached version as well as
the session persisted in the database. However, each node maintains
their isolated version of the session. When the user logs out, the
session is removed from the node-local cache and deleted from the
database. The other nodes will however still use the cached session.
These nodes will only fail to accept the session id if they intent to
update the session in the database. They will then notice that the
session is gone. This is true for most API requests originating from
user interaction with the Graylog UI because these will lead to an
update of the session's "last access" timestamp. If the session update
is however prevented by setting the `X-Graylog-No-Session-
Extension:true` header in the request, the node will consider the
(cached) session valid until the session is expired according to its
timeout setting. No session identifiers are leaked. After a user has
logged out, the UI shows the login screen again, which gives the user
the impression that their session is not valid anymore. However, if
the session becomes compromised later, it can still be used to perform
API requests against the Graylog cluster. The time frame for this is
limited to the configured session lifetime, starting from the time
when the user logged out. This issue has been addressed in versions
5.0.9 and 5.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade.

Graylog is a free and open log management platform. A partial path
traversal vulnerability exists in Graylog's `Support Bundle` feature.
The vulnerability is caused by incorrect user input validation in an
HTTP API resource. Graylog's Support Bundle feature allows an attacker
with valid Admin role credentials to download or delete files in
sibling directories of the support bundle directory. The default
`data_dir` in operating system packages (DEB, RPM) is set to
`/var/lib/graylog-server`. The data directory for the Support Bundle
feature is always `<data_dir>/support-bundle`. Due to the partial path
traversal vulnerability, an attacker with valid Admin role credentials
can read or delete files in directories that start with a
`/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundle` directory name. The
vulnerability would allow the download or deletion of files in the
following example directories: `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-
bundle-test` and `/var/lib/graylog-server/support-bundlesdirectory`.
For the Graylog Docker images, the `data_dir` is set to
`/usr/share/graylog/data` by default. This vulnerability is fixed in
Graylog version 5.1.3 and later. Users are advised to upgrade. Users
unable to upgrade should block all HTTP requests to the following HTTP
API endpoints by using a reverse proxy server in front of Graylog.
`GET /api/system/debug/support/bundle/download/{filename}` and `DELETE
/api/system/debug/support/bundle/{filename}`.

Graylog is a free and open log management platform. Graylog makes use
of only one single source port for DNS queries. Graylog binds a single
socket for outgoing DNS queries and while that socket is bound to a
random port number it is never changed again. This goes against
recommended practice since 2008, when Dan Kaminsky discovered how easy
is to carry out DNS cache poisoning attacks. In order to prevent cache
poisoning with spoofed DNS responses, it is necessary to maximise the
uncertainty in the choice of a source port for a DNS query. Although
unlikely in many setups, an external attacker could inject forged DNS
responses into a Graylog's lookup table cache. In order to prevent
this, it is at least recommendable to distribute the DNS queries
through a pool of distinct sockets, each of them with a random source
port and renew them periodically. This issue has been addressed in
versions 5.0.9 and 5.1.3. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this issue.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. It is possible in XWiki to
execute Velocity code without having script right by creating an
XClass with a property of type "TextArea" and content type
"VelocityCode" or "VelocityWiki". For the former, the syntax of the
document needs to be set the `xwiki/1.0` (this syntax doesn't need to
be installed). In both cases, when adding the property to an object,
the Velocity code is executed regardless of the rights of the author
of the property (edit right is still required, though). In both cases,
the code is executed with the correct context author so no privileged
APIs can be accessed. However, Velocity still grants access to
otherwise inaccessible data and APIs that could allow further
privilege escalation. At least for "VelocityCode", this behavior is
most likely very old but only since XWiki 7.2, script right is a
separate right, before that version all users were allowed to execute
Velocity and thus this was expected and not a security issue. This has
been patched in XWiki 14.10.10 and 15.4 RC1. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds.

plone.namedfile allows users to handle `File` and `Image` fields
targeting, but not depending on, Plone Dexterity content. Prior to
versions 5.6.1, 6.0.3, 6.1.3, and 6.2.1, there is a stored cross site
scripting vulnerability for SVG images. A security hotfix from 2021
already partially fixed this by making sure SVG images are always
downloaded instead of shown inline. But the same problem still exists
for scales of SVG images. Note that an image tag with an SVG image as
source is not vulnerable, even when the SVG image contains malicious
code. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to
upload an image, and then trick a user into following a specially
crafted link. Patches are available in versions 5.6.1 (for Plone 5.2),
6.0.3 (for Plone 6.0.0-6.0.4), 6.1.3 (for Plone 6.0.5-6.0.6), and

AccessControl provides a general security framework for use in Zope.
Python's "format" functionality allows someone controlling the format
string to "read" objects accessible (recursively) via attribute access
and subscription from accessible objects. Those attribute accesses and
subscriptions use Python's full blown `getattr` and `getitem`, not the
policy restricted `AccessControl` variants `_getattr_` and
`_getitem_`. This can lead to critical information disclosure.
`AccessControl` already provides a safe variant for `str.format` and
denies access to `string.Formatter`. However, `str.format_map` is
still unsafe. Affected are all users who allow untrusted users to
create `AccessControl` controlled Python code and execute it. A fix
has been introduced in versions 4.4, 5.8 and 6.2. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

In a typical Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) there are several
components, such as boot loader, virtual device drivers, virtio
backend drivers and vhost drivers, that need to access the VM physical
memory. The vm-memory rust crate provides a set of traits to decouple
VM memory consumers from VM memory providers. An issue was discovered
in the default implementations of the
`VolatileMemory::{get_atomic_ref, aligned_as_ref, aligned_as_mut,
get_ref, get_array_ref}` trait functions, which allows out-of-bounds
memory access if the `VolatileMemory::get_slice` function returns a
`VolatileSlice` whose length is less than the function&#8217;s `count`
argument. No implementations of `get_slice` provided in `vm_memory`
are affected. Users of custom `VolatileMemory` implementations may be
impacted if the custom implementation does not adhere to `get_slice`'s
documentation. The issue started in version 0.1.0 but was fixed in
version 0.12.2 by inserting a check that verifies that the
`VolatileSlice` returned by `get_slice` is of the correct length.
Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this

Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in the `image_proxy.php`
file of LibreY before commit 8f9b9803f231e2954e5b49987a532d28fe50a627.
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to use the server as a
proxy to send HTTP GET requests to arbitrary targets and retrieve
information in the internal network or conduct Denial-of-Service (DoS)
attacks via the `url` parameter. Remote attackers can use the server
as a proxy to send HTTP GET requests and retrieve information in the
internal network. Remote attackers can also request the server to
download large files or chain requests among multiple instances to
reduce the performance of the server or even deny access from
legitimate users. This issue has been addressed in
https://github.com/Ahwxorg/LibreY/pull/31. LibreY hosters are advised
to use the latest commit. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

hyper-bump-it is a command line tool for updating the version in
project files.`hyper-bump-it` reads a file glob pattern from the
configuration file. That is combined with the project root directory
to construct a full glob pattern that is used to find files that
should be edited. These matched files should be contained within the
project root directory, but that is not checked. This could result in
changes being written to files outside of the project. The default
behaviour of `hyper-bump-it` is to display the planned changes and
prompt the user for confirmation before editing any files. However,
the configuration file provides a field that can be used cause files
to be edited without displaying the prompt. This issue has been fixed
in release version 0.5.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users that are
unable to update from vulnerable versions, executing `hyper-bump-it`
with the `--interactive` command line argument will ensure that all
planned changes are displayed and prompt the user for confirmation
before editing any files, even if the configuration file contains
`show_confirm_prompt=true`.

Parse Server is an open source backend server. In affected versions
the Parse Cloud trigger `beforeFind` is not invoked in certain
conditions of `Parse.Query`. This can pose a vulnerability for
deployments where the `beforeFind` trigger is used as a security layer
to modify the incoming query. The vulnerability has been fixed by
refactoring the internal query pipeline for a more concise code
structure and implementing a patch to ensure the `beforeFind` trigger
is invoked. This fix was introduced in commit `be4c7e23c6` and has
been included in releases 6.2.2 and 5.5.5. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should make use of parse server's
security layers to manage access levels with Class-Level Permissions
and Object-Level Access Control that should be used instead of custom
security layers in Cloud Code triggers.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/28/7

Important: Authentication Bypass CVE-2023-41081 The mod_jk component
of Apache Tomcat Connectors in some circumstances, such as when a
configuration included "JkOptions +ForwardDirectories" but the
configuration did not provide explicit mounts for all possible proxied
requests, mod_jk would use an implicit mapping and map the request to
the first defined worker. Such an implicit mapping could result in the
unintended exposure of the status worker and/or bypass security
constraints configured in httpd. As of JK 1.2.49, the implicit mapping
functionality has been removed and all mappings must now be via
explicit configuration. Only mod_jk is affected by this issue. The
ISAPI redirector is not affected. This issue affects Apache Tomcat
Connectors (mod_jk only): from 1.2.0 through 1.2.48. Users are
recommended to upgrade to version 1.2.49, which fixes the issue.

Reference: MISC:https://webiny.com

@webiny/react-rich-text-renderer before 5.37.2 allows XSS attacks by
content managers. This is a react component to render data coming from
Webiny Headless CMS and Webiny Form Builder. Webiny is an open-source
serverless enterprise CMS. The @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer
package depends on the editor.js rich text editor to handle rich text
content. The CMS stores rich text content from the editor.js into the
database. When the @webiny/react-rich-text-renderer is used to render
such content, it uses the dangerouslySetInnerHTML prop, without
applying HTML sanitization. The issue arises when an actor, who in
this context would specifically be a content manager with access to
the CMS, inserts a malicious script as part of the user-defined input.
This script is then injected and executed within the user's browser
when the main page or admin page loads.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/14/3

In the Apache Airflow HDFS Provider, versions prior to 4.1.1, a
documentation info pointed users to an install incorrect pip package.
As this package name was unclaimed, in theory, an attacker could claim
this package and provide code that would be executed when this package
was installed. The Airflow team has since taken ownership of the
package (neutralizing the risk), and fixed the doc strings in version
4.1.1

The Apollo Router is a configurable, high-performance graph router
written in Rust to run a federated supergraph that uses Apollo
Federation 2. Affected versions are subject to a Denial-of-Service
(DoS) type vulnerability which causes the Router to panic and
terminate when GraphQL Subscriptions are enabled. It can be triggered
when **all of the following conditions are met**: 1. Running Apollo
Router v1.28.0, v1.28.1 or v1.29.0 ("impacted versions"); **and** 2.
The Supergraph schema provided to the Router (either via Apollo Uplink
or explicitly via other configuration) **has a `subscription` type**
with root-fields defined; **and** 3. The YAML configuration provided
to the Router **has subscriptions enabled** (they are _disabled_ by
default), either by setting `enabled: true` _or_ by setting a valid
`mode` within the `subscriptions` object (as seen in [subscriptions'
documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/router/executing-
operations/subscription-support/#router-setup)); **and** 4. An
[anonymous](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Anonymous-Operation-
Definitions) (i.e., un-named) `subscription` operation (e.g.,
`subscription { ... }`) is received by the Router If **all four** of
these criteria are met, the impacted versions will panic and
terminate. There is no data-privacy risk or sensitive-information
exposure aspect to this vulnerability. This is fixed in Apollo Router
v1.29.1. Users are advised to upgrade. Updating to v1.29.1 should be a
clear and simple upgrade path for those running impacted versions.
However, if Subscriptions are **not** necessary for your Graph &#8211; but
are enabled via configuration &#8212; then disabling subscriptions is
another option to mitigate the risk.

matrix-media-repo is a highly customizable multi-domain media
repository for the Matrix chat ecosystem. In affected versions an
attacker could upload a malicious piece of media to the media repo,
which would then be served with `Content-Disposition: inline` upon
download. This vulnerability could be leveraged to execute scripts
embedded in SVG content. Commits `77ec235` and `bf8abdd` fix the issue
and are included in the 1.3.0 release. Operators should upgrade to
v1.3.0 as soon as possible. Operators unable to upgrade should
override the `Content-Disposition` header returned by matrix-media-
repo as a workaround.

Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the
fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the
enforcement of privacy regulations in code. The Fides webserver API
allows custom integrations to be uploaded as a ZIP file. This ZIP file
must contain YAML files, but Fides can be configured to also accept
the inclusion of custom Python code in it. The custom code is executed
in a restricted, sandboxed environment, but the sandbox can be
bypassed to execute any arbitrary code. The vulnerability allows the
execution of arbitrary code on the target system within the context of
the webserver python process owner on the webserver container, which
by default is `root`, and leverage that access to attack underlying
infrastructure and integrated systems. This vulnerability affects
Fides versions `2.11.0` through `2.19.0`. Exploitation is limited to
API clients with the `CONNECTOR_TEMPLATE_REGISTER` authorization
scope. In the Fides Admin UI this scope is restricted to highly
privileged users, specifically root users and users with the owner
role. Exploitation is only possible if the security configuration
parameter `allow_custom_connector_functions` is enabled by the user
deploying the Fides webserver container, either in `fides.toml` or by
setting the env var
`FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS=True`. By default
this configuration parameter is disabled. The vulnerability has been
patched in Fides version `2.19.0`. Users are advised to upgrade to
this version or later to secure their systems against this threat.
Users unable to upgrade should ensure that
`allow_custom_connector_functions` in `fides.toml` and the
`FIDES__SECURITY__ALLOW_CUSTOM_CONNECTOR_FUNCTIONS` are both either
unset or explicit set to `False`.

OP-TEE is a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) designed as companion
to a non-secure Linux kernel running on Arm; Cortex-A cores using the
TrustZone technology. Starting in version 3.20 and prior to version
3.22, `shdr_verify_signature` can make a double free.
`shdr_verify_signature` used to verify a TA binary before it is
loaded. To verify a signature of it, allocate a memory for RSA key.
RSA key allocate function (`sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key`)
will try to allocate a memory (which is optee&#8217;s heap memory). RSA key
is consist of exponent and modulus (represent as variable `e`, `n`)
and it allocation is not atomic way, so it may succeed in `e` but fail
in `n`. In this case sw_crypto_acipher_alloc_rsa_public_key` will free
on `e` and return as it is failed but variable &#8216;e&#8217; is remained as
already freed memory address . `shdr_verify_signature` will free again
that memory (which is `e`) even it is freed when it failed allocate
RSA key. A patch is available in version 3.22. No known workarounds

Reference: URL:https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses

WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. WireMock can be
configured to only permit proxying (and therefore recording) to
certain addresses. This is achieved via a list of allowed address
rules and a list of denied address rules, where the allowed list is
evaluated first. Until WireMock Webhooks Extension 3.0.0-beta-15, the
filtering of target addresses from the proxy mode DID NOT work for
Webhooks, so the users were potentially vulnerable regardless of the
`limitProxyTargets` settings. Via the WireMock webhooks configuration,
POST requests from a webhook might be forwarded to an arbitrary
service reachable from WireMock&#8217;s instance. For example, If someone is
running the WireMock docker Container inside a private cluster, they
can trigger internal POST requests against unsecured APIs or even
against secure ones by passing a token, discovered using another
exploit, via authentication headers. This issue has been addressed in

Reference: URL:https://wiremock.org/docs/configuration/#preventing-proxying-to-and-recording-from-specific-target-addresses

WireMock is a tool for mocking HTTP services. The proxy mode of
WireMock, can be protected by the network restrictions configuration,
as documented in Preventing proxying to and recording from specific
target addresses. These restrictions can be configured using the
domain names, and in such a case the configuration is vulnerable to
the DNS rebinding attacks. A similar patch was applied in WireMock
3.0.0-beta-15 for the WireMock Webhook Extensions. The root cause of
the attack is a defect in the logic which allows for a race condition
triggered by a DNS server whose address expires in between the initial
validation and the outbound network request that might go to a domain
that was supposed to be prohibited. Control over a DNS service is
required to exploit this attack, so it has high execution complexity
and limited impact. This issue has been addressed in version 2.35.1 of
wiremock-jre8 and wiremock-jre8-standalone, version 3.0.3 of wiremock
and wiremock-standalone, version 2.6.1 of the python version of
wiremock, and versions 2.35.1-1 and 3.0.3-1 of the wiremock/wiremock
Docker container. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
upgrade should either configure firewall rules to define the list of
permitted destinations or to configure WireMock to use IP addresses
instead of the domain names.

knplabs/knp-snappy is a PHP library allowing thumbnail, snapshot or
PDF generation from a url or a html page. ## Issue On March 17th the
vulnerability CVE-2023-28115 was disclosed, allowing an attacker to
gain remote code execution through PHAR deserialization. Version 1.4.2
added a check `if (\strpos($filename, 'phar://') === 0)` in the
`prepareOutput` function to resolve this CVE, however if the user is
able to control the second parameter of the `generateFromHtml()`
function of Snappy, it will then be passed as the `$filename`
parameter in the `prepareOutput()` function. In the original
vulnerability, a file name with a `phar://` wrapper could be sent to
the `fileExists()` function, equivalent to the `file_exists()` PHP
function. This allowed users to trigger a deserialization on arbitrary
PHAR files. To fix this issue, the string is now passed to the
`strpos()` function and if it starts with `phar://`, an exception is
raised. However, PHP wrappers being case insensitive, this patch can
be bypassed using `PHAR://` instead of `phar://`. A successful
exploitation of this vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code and
accessing the underlying filesystem. The attacker must be able to
upload a file and the server must be running a PHP version prior to 8.
This issue has been addressed in commit `d3b742d61a` which has been
included in version 1.4.3. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable
to upgrade should ensure that only trusted users may submit data to
the `AbstractGenerator->generate(...)` function.

SOFARPC is a Java RPC framework. Versions prior to 5.11.0 are
vulnerable to remote command execution. Through a carefully crafted
payload, an attacker can achieve JNDI injection or system command
execution. In the default configuration of the SOFARPC framework, a
blacklist is used to filter out dangerous classes encountered during
the deserialization process. However, the blacklist is not
comprehensive, and an actor can exploit certain native JDK classes and
common third-party packages to construct gadget chains capable of
achieving JNDI injection or system command execution attacks. Version
5.11.0 contains a fix for this issue. As a workaround, users can add `
-Drpc_serialize_blacklist_override=javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat
` to the blacklist.

Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an
eBPF-based dataplane. In Cilium clusters where Cilium's Layer 7 proxy
has been disabled, creating workloads with `policy.cilium.io/proxy-
visibility` annotations (in Cilium >= v1.13) or `io.cilium.proxy-
visibility` annotations (in Cilium <= v1.12) causes the Cilium agent
to segfault on the node to which the workload is assigned. Existing
traffic on the affected node will continue to flow, but the Cilium
agent on the node will not able to process changes to workloads
running on the node. This will also prevent workloads from being able
to start on the affected node. The denial of service will be limited
to the node on which the workload is scheduled, however an attacker
may be able to schedule workloads on the node of their choosing, which
could lead to targeted attacks. This issue has been resolved in Cilium
versions 1.14.2, 1.13.7, and 1.12.14. Users unable to upgrade can
avoid this denial of service attack by enabling the Layer 7 proxy.

Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an
eBPF-based dataplane. An attacker with the ability to create or modify
CiliumNetworkPolicy objects in a particular namespace is able to
affect traffic on an entire Cilium cluster, potentially bypassing
policy enforcement in other namespaces. By using a crafted
`endpointSelector` that uses the `DoesNotExist` operator on the
`reserved:init` label, the attacker can create policies that bypass
namespace restrictions and affect the entire Cilium cluster. This
includes potentially allowing or denying all traffic. This attack
requires API server access, as described in the Kubernetes API Server
Attacker section of the Cilium Threat Model. This issue has been
resolved in Cilium versions 1.14.2, 1.13.7, and 1.12.14. As a
workaround an admission webhook can be used to prevent the use of
`endpointSelectors` that use the `DoesNotExist` operator on the
`reserved:init` label in CiliumNetworkPolicies.

Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by
the Matrix.org Foundation. When users update their passwords, the new
credentials may be briefly held in the server database. While this
doesn't grant the server any added capabilities&#8212;it already learns the
users' passwords as part of the authentication process&#8212;it does disrupt
the expectation that passwords won't be stored in the database. As a
result, these passwords could inadvertently be captured in database
backups for a longer duration. These temporarily stored passwords are
automatically erased after a 48-hour window. This issue has been
addressed in version 1.93.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are
no known workarounds for this issue.

h2o is an HTTP server with support for HTTP/1.x, HTTP/2 and HTTP/3. In
version 2.3.0-beta2 and prior, when h2o is configured to listen to
multiple addresses or ports with each of them using different backend
servers managed by multiple entities, a malicious backend entity that
also has the opportunity to observe or inject packets exchanged
between the client and h2o may misdirect HTTPS requests going to other
backends and observe the contents of that HTTPS request being sent.
The attack involves a victim client trying to resume a TLS connection
and an attacker redirecting the packets to a different address or port
than that intended by the client. The attacker must already have been
configured by the administrator of h2o to act as a backend to one of
the addresses or ports that the h2o instance listens to. Session IDs
and tickets generated by h2o are not bound to information specific to
the server address, port, or the X.509 certificate, and therefore it
is possible for an attacker to force the victim connection to
wrongfully resume against a different server address or port on which
the same h2o instance is listening. Once a TLS session is misdirected
to resume to a server address / port that is configured to use an
attacker-controlled server as the backend, depending on the
configuration, HTTPS requests from the victim client may be forwarded
to the attacker's server. An H2O instance is vulnerable to this attack
only if the instance is configured to listen to different addresses or
ports using the listen directive at the host level and the instance is
configured to connect to backend servers managed by multiple entities.
A patch is available at commit
35760540337a47e5150da0f4a66a609fad2ef0ab. As a workaround, one may
stop using using host-level listen directives in favor of global-level
ones.

Fiber is an Express inspired web framework built in the go language.
Versions of gofiber prior to 2.49.2 did not properly restrict access
to localhost. This issue impacts users of our project who rely on the
`ctx.IsFromLocal` method to restrict access to localhost requests. If
exploited, it could allow unauthorized access to resources intended
only for localhost. Setting `X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1` in a request
from a foreign host, will result in true for `ctx.IsFromLocal`. Access
is limited to the scope of the affected process. This issue has been
patched in version `2.49.2` with commit `b8c9ede6`. Users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds to remediate this
vulnerability without upgrading to the patched version.

A design flaw was found in Samba's DirSync control implementation,
which exposes passwords and secrets in Active Directory to privileged
users and Read-Only Domain Controllers (RODCs). This flaw allows RODCs
and users possessing the GET_CHANGES right to access all attributes,
including sensitive secrets and passwords. Even in a default setup,
RODC DC accounts, which should only replicate some passwords, can gain
access to all domain secrets, including the vital krbtgt, effectively
eliminating the RODC / DC distinction. Furthermore, the vulnerability
fails to account for error conditions (fail open), like out-of-memory
situations, potentially granting access to secret attributes, even
under low-privileged attacker influence.

A flaw was found in KVM AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) in
the Linux kernel. A KVM guest using SEV-ES or SEV-SNP with multiple
vCPUs can trigger a double fetch race condition vulnerability and
invoke the `VMGEXIT` handler recursively. If an attacker manages to
call the handler multiple times, they can trigger a stack overflow and
cause a denial of service or potentially guest-to-host escape in
kernel configurations without stack guard pages (`CONFIG_VMAP_STACK`).

GeoServer is an open source software server written in Java that
allows users to share and edit geospatial data. A path traversal
vulnerability in versions 2.23.4 and prior requires GeoServer
Administrator with access to the admin console to misconfigure the
Global Settings for log file location to an arbitrary location. The
admin console GeoServer Logs page provides a preview of these
contents. As this issue requires GeoServer administrators access,
often representing a trusted party, the vulnerability has not received
a patch as of time of publication. As a workaround, a system
administrator responsible for running GeoServer can use the
`GEOSERVER_LOG_FILE` setting to override any configuration option
provided by the Global Settings page. The `GEOSERVER_LOG_LOCATION`
parameter can be set as system property, environment variables, or
servlet context parameters.

Magento LTS is the official OpenMage LTS codebase. Guest orders may be
viewed without authentication using a "guest-view" cookie which
contains the order's "protect_code". This code is 6 hexadecimal
characters which is arguably not enough to prevent a brute-force
attack. Exposing each order would require a separate brute force
attack. This issue has been patched in versions 19.5.1 and 20.1.1.

Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly. Wasmtime versions
from 10.0.0 to versions 10.02, 11.0.2, and 12.0.1 contain a
miscompilation of the WebAssembly `i64x2.shr_s` instruction on x86_64
platforms when the shift amount is a constant value that is larger
than 32. Only x86_64 is affected so all other targets are not affected
by this. The miscompilation results in the instruction producing an
incorrect result, namely the low 32-bits of the second lane of the
vector are derived from the low 32-bits of the second lane of the
input vector instead of the high 32-bits. The primary impact of this
issue is that any WebAssembly program using the `i64x2.shr_s` with a
constant shift amount larger than 32 may produce an incorrect result.
This issue is not an escape from the WebAssembly sandbox. Execution of
WebAssembly guest programs will still behave correctly with respect to
memory sandboxing and isolation from the host. Wasmtime considers non-
spec-compliant behavior as a security issue nonetheless. This issue
was discovered through fuzzing of Wasmtime's code generator Cranelift.
Wasmtime versions 10.0.2, 11.0.2, and 12.0.2 are all patched to no
longer have this miscompilation. This issue only affects x86_64 hosts
and the only workaround is to either scan for this pattern in wasm
modules which is nontrivial or to disable the SIMD proposal for
WebAssembly. Users prior to 10.0.0 are unaffected by this
vulnerability.

vantage6 is privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure. When
a collaboration is deleted, the linked resources (such as tasks from
that collaboration) should be deleted. This is partly to manage data
properly, but also to prevent a potential (but unlikely) side-effect
that affects versions prior to 4.0.0, where if a collaboration with
id=10 is deleted, and subsequently a new collaboration is created with
id=10, the authenticated users in that collaboration could potentially
see results of the deleted collaboration in some cases. Version 4.0.0
contains a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.

vantage6 is privacy preserving federated learning infrastructure. The
endpoint /api/collaboration/{id}/task is used to collect all tasks
from a certain collaboration. To get such tasks, a user should have
permission to view the collaboration and to view the tasks in it.
However, prior to version 4.0.0, it is only checked if the user has
permission to view the collaboration. Version 4.0.0 contains a patch.
There are no known workarounds.

Piccolo is an ORM and query builder which supports asyncio. In
versions 0.120.0 and prior, the implementation of `BaseUser.login`
leaks enough information to a malicious user such that they would be
able to successfully generate a list of valid users on the platform.
As Piccolo on its own does not also enforce strong passwords, these
lists of valid accounts are likely to be used in a password spray
attack with the outcome being attempted takeover of user accounts on
the platform. The impact of this vulnerability is minor as it requires
chaining with other attack vectors in order to gain more then simply a
list of valid users on the underlying platform. The likelihood of this
vulnerability is possible as it requires minimal skills to pull off,
especially given the underlying login functionality for Piccolo based
sites is open source. This issue has been patched in version 0.121.0.

SHIRASAGI is a Content Management System. Prior to version 1.18.0,
SHIRASAGI is vulnerable to a Post-Unicode normalization issue. This
happens when a logical validation or a security check is performed
before a Unicode normalization. The Unicode character equivalent of a
character would resurface after the normalization. The fix is
initially performing the Unicode normalization and then strip for all
whitespaces and then checking for a blank string. This issue has been
fixed in version 1.18.0.

Sustainsys.Saml2 library adds SAML2P support to ASP.NET web sites,
allowing the web site to act as a SAML2 Service Provider. Prior to
versions 1.0.3 and 2.9.2, when a response is processed, the issuer of
the Identity Provider is not sufficiently validated. This could allow
a malicious identity provider to craft a Saml2 response that is
processed as if issued by another identity provider. It is also
possible for a malicious end user to cause stored state intended for
one identity provider to be used when processing the response from
another provider. An application is impacted if they rely on any of
these features in their authentication/authorization logic: the issuer
of the generated identity and claims; or items in the stored request
state (AuthenticationProperties). This issue is patched in versions
2.9.2 and 1.0.3. The `AcsCommandResultCreated` notification can be
used to add the validation required if an upgrade to patched packages
is not possible.

Home assistant is an open source home automation. The audit team&#8217;s
analyses confirmed that the `redirect_uri` and `client_id` are
alterable when logging in. Consequently, the code parameter utilized
to fetch the `access_token` post-authentication will be sent to the
URL specified in the aforementioned parameters. Since an arbitrary URL
is permitted and `homeassistant.local` represents the preferred,
default domain likely used and trusted by many users, an attacker
could leverage this weakness to manipulate a user and retrieve account
access. Notably, this attack strategy is plausible if the victim has
exposed their Home Assistant to the Internet, since after acquiring
the victim&#8217;s `access_token` the adversary would need to utilize it
directly towards the instance to achieve any pertinent malicious
actions. To achieve this compromise attempt, the attacker must send a
link with a `redirect_uri` that they control to the victim&#8217;s own Home
Assistant instance. In the eventuality the victim authenticates via
said link, the attacker would obtain code sent to the specified URL in
`redirect_uri`, which can then be leveraged to fetch an
`access_token`. Pertinently, an attacker could increase the efficacy
of this strategy by registering a near identical domain to
`homeassistant.local`, which at first glance may appear legitimate and
thereby obfuscate any malicious intentions. This issue has been
addressed in version 2023.9.0 and all users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Home assistant is an open source home automation. The Home Assistant
login page allows users to use their local Home Assistant credentials
and log in to another website that specifies the `redirect_uri` and
`client_id` parameters. Although the `redirect_uri` validation
typically ensures that it matches the `client_id` and the scheme
represents either `http` or `https`, Home Assistant will fetch the
`client_id` and check for `<link rel="redirect_uri" href="...">` HTML
tags on the page. These URLs are not subjected to the same scheme
validation and thus allow for arbitrary JavaScript execution on the
Home Assistant administration page via usage of `javascript:` scheme
URIs. This Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability can be executed on
the Home Assistant frontend domain, which may be used for a full
takeover of the Home Assistant account and installation. This issue

Home assistant is an open source home automation. Whilst auditing the
frontend code to identify hidden parameters, Cure53 detected
`auth_callback=1`, which is leveraged by the WebSocket authentication
logic in tandem with the `state` parameter. The state parameter
contains the `hassUrl`, which is subsequently utilized to establish a
WebSocket connection. This behavior permits an attacker to create a
malicious Home Assistant link with a modified state parameter that
forces the frontend to connect to an alternative WebSocket backend.
Henceforth, the attacker can spoof any WebSocket responses and trigger
cross site scripting (XSS). Since the XSS is executed on the actual
Home Assistant frontend domain, it can connect to the real Home
Assistant backend, which essentially represents a comprehensive
takeover scenario. Permitting the site to be iframed by other origins,
as discussed in GHSA-935v-rmg9-44mw, renders this exploit
substantially covert since a malicious website can obfuscate the
compromise strategy in the background. However, even without this, the
attacker can still send the `auth_callback` link directly to the
victim user. To mitigate this issue, Cure53 advises modifying the
WebSocket code&#8217;s authentication flow. An optimal implementation in
this regard would not trust the `hassUrl` passed in by a GET
parameter. Cure53 must stipulate the significant time required of the
Cure53 consultants to identify an XSS vector, despite holding full
control over the WebSocket responses. In many areas, data from the
WebSocket was properly sanitized, which hinders post-exploitation. The
audit team eventually detected the `js_url` for custom panels, though
generally, the frontend exhibited reasonable security hardening. This
issue has been addressed in Home Assistant Core version 2023.8.0 and
in the npm package home-assistant-js-websocket in version 8.2.0. Users
are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

Jetty is a Java based web server and servlet engine. Versions 9.4.21
through 9.4.51, 10.0.15, and 11.0.15 are vulnerable to weak
authentication. If a Jetty `OpenIdAuthenticator` uses the optional
nested `LoginService`, and that `LoginService` decides to revoke an
already authenticated user, then the current request will still treat
the user as authenticated. The authentication is then cleared from the
session and subsequent requests will not be treated as authenticated.
So a request on a previously authenticated session could be allowed to

CVE-2023-1076 are incorrect or incomplete. The problem is that the
following upstream commits - a096ccca6e50 ("tun: tun_chr_open():

correctly initialize socket uid"), pass "inode->i_uid" to

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched:
cls_route component can be exploited to achieve local privilege
escalation. When route4_change() is called on an existing filter, the
whole tcf_result struct is always copied into the new instance of the
filter. This causes a problem when updating a filter bound to a class,
as tcf_unbind_filter() is always called on the old instance in the
success path, decreasing filter_cnt of the still referenced class and
allowing it to be deleted, leading to a use-after-free. We recommend
upgrading past commit b80b829e9e2c1b3f7aae34855e04d8f6ecaf13c8.

The Simplr Registration Form Plus+ plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
to Insecure Direct Object References in versions up to, and including,
2.4.5. This is due to the plugin providing user-controlled access to
objects, letting a user bypass authorization and access system
resources. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with
subscriber-level permissions or above to change user passwords and
potentially take over administrator accounts.

GeoNode is an open source platform that facilitates the creation,
sharing, and collaborative use of geospatial data. A SSRF
vulnerability exists starting in version 3.2.0, bypassing existing
controls on the software. This can allow a user to request internal
services for a full read SSRF, returning any data from the internal
network. The application is using a whitelist, but the whitelist can
be bypassed. The bypass will trick the application that the first host
is a whitelisted address, but the browser will use `@` or `%40` as a
credential to the host geoserver on port 8080, this will return the
data to that host on the response. Version 4.1.3.post1 is the first
available version that contains a patch.

JumpServer is an open source bastion host and a professional operation
and maintenance security audit system. Starting in version 3.0.0 and
prior to versions 3.5.5 and 3.6.4, session replays can download
without authentication. Session replays stored in S3, OSS, or other
cloud storage are not affected. The api `/api/v1/terminal/sessions/`
permission control is broken and can be accessed anonymously.
SessionViewSet permission classes set to `[RBACPermission |
IsSessionAssignee]`, relation is or, so any permission matched will be
allowed. Versions 3.5.5 and 3.6.4 have a fix. After upgrading, visit
the api `$HOST/api/v1/terminal/sessions/?limit=1`. The expected http
response code is 401 (`not_authenticated`).

Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine (EVM). In version 0.3.9 and prior, under certain conditions,
the memory used by the builtins `raw_call`, `create_from_blueprint`
and `create_copy_of` can be corrupted. For `raw_call`, the argument
buffer of the call can be corrupted, leading to incorrect `calldata`
in the sub-context. For `create_from_blueprint` and `create_copy_of`,
the buffer for the to-be-deployed bytecode can be corrupted, leading
to deploying incorrect bytecode. Each builtin has conditions that must
be fulfilled for the corruption to happen. For `raw_call`, the `data`
argument of the builtin must be `msg.data` and the `value` or `gas`
passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in
writing to the memory. For `create_copy_of`, the `value` or `salt`
passed to the builtin must be some complex expression that results in
writing to the memory. For `create_from_blueprint`, either no
constructor parameters should be passed to the builtin or `raw_args`
should be set to True, and the `value` or `salt` passed to the builtin
must be some complex expression that results in writing to the memory.
As of time of publication, no patched version exists. The issue is
still being investigated, and there might be other cases where the
corruption might happen. When the builtin is being called from an
`internal` function `F`, the issue is not present provided that the
function calling `F` wrote to memory before calling `F`. As a
workaround, the complex expressions that are being passed as kwargs to
the builtin should be cached in memory prior to the call to the
builtin.

phonenumber is a library for parsing, formatting and validating
international phone numbers. Prior to versions `0.3.3+8.13.9` and
`0.2.5+8.11.3`, the phonenumber parsing code may panic due to a panic-
guarded out-of-bounds access on the phonenumber string. In a typical
deployment of `rust-phonenumber`, this may get triggered by feeding a
maliciously crafted phonenumber over the network, specifically the
string `.;phone-context=`. Versions `0.3.3+8.13.9` and `0.2.5+8.11.3`
contain a patch for this issue. There are no known workarounds.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support
for multi-language development. In some cases, when Gradle parses XML
files, resolving XML external entities is not disabled. Combined with
an Out Of Band XXE attack (OOB-XXE), just parsing XML can lead to
exfiltration of local text files to a remote server. Gradle parses XML
files for several purposes. Most of the time, Gradle parses XML files
it generated or were already present locally. Only Ivy XML descriptors
and Maven POM files can be fetched from remote repositories and parsed
by Gradle. In Gradle 7.6.3 and 8.4, resolving XML external entities
has been disabled for all use cases to protect against this
vulnerability. Gradle will now refuse to parse XML files that have XML
external entities.

Hydra is the layer-two scalability solution for Cardano. Prior to
version 0.13.0, the specification states that the contestation period
in the datum of the UTxO at the head validator must stay unchanged as
the state progresses from Open to Closed (Close transaction), but no
such check appears to be performed in the `checkClose` function of the
head validator. This would allow a malicious participant to modify the
contestation deadline of the head to either allow them to fanout the
head without giving another participant the chance to contest, or
prevent any participant from ever redistributing the funds locked in
the head via a fan-out. Version 0.13.0 contains a patch for this
issue.

Hydra is the two-layer scalability solution for Cardano. Prior to
version 0.13.0, it is possible for a malicious head initializer to
extract one or more PTs for the head they are initializing due to
incorrect data validation logic in the head token minting policy which
then results in an flawed check for burning the head ST in the
`initial` validator. This is possible because it is not checked in
`HeadTokens.hs` that the datums of the outputs at the `initial`
validator are equal to the real head ID, and it is also not checked in
the `off-chain code`. During the `Initial` state of the protocol, if
the malicious initializer removes a PT from the Hydra scripts it
becomes impossible for any other participant to reclaim any funds they
have attempted to commit into the head, as to do so the Abort
transaction must burn all the PTs for the head, but they cannot burn
the PT which the attacker controls and so cannot satisfy this
requirement. That means the initializer can lock the other
participants committed funds forever or until they choose to return
the PT (ransom). The malicious initializer can also use the PT to
spoof that they have committed a particular TxO when progressing the
head into the `Open` state. For example, they could say they committed
a TxO residing at their address containing 100 ADA, but in fact this
100 ADA was not moved into the head, and thus in order for an other
participant to perform the fanout they will be forced to pay the
attacker the 100 ADA out of their own funds, as the fanout transaction
must pay all the committed TxOs (even though the attacker did not
really commit that TxO). They can do this by placing the PT in a UTxO
with a well-formed `Commit` datum with whatever contents they like,
then use this UTxO in the `collectCom` transaction. There may be other
possible ways to abuse having control of a PT. Version 0.13.0 fixes
this issue.

the configuration file to specify the database connection string
prevents exposing it on vulnerable versions. Using a different web

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20231102 Session File Relative Path Traversal in sudo-rs
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/02/1

Sudo-rs, a memory safe implementation of sudo and su, allows users to
not have to enter authentication at every sudo attempt, but instead
only requiring authentication every once in a while in every terminal
or process group. Only once a configurable timeout has passed will the
user have to re-authenticate themselves. Supporting this functionality
is a set of session files (timestamps) for each user, stored in
`/var/run/sudo-rs/ts`. These files are named according to the username
from which the sudo attempt is made (the origin user). An issue was
discovered in versions prior to 0.2.1 where usernames containing the
`.` and `/` characters could result in the corruption of specific
files on the filesystem. As usernames are generally not limited by the
characters they can contain, a username appearing to be a relative
path can be constructed. For example we could add a user to the system
containing the username `../../../../bin/cp`. When logged in as a user
with that name, that user could run `sudo -K` to clear their session
record file. The session code then constructs the path to the session
file by concatenating the username to the session file storage
directory, resulting in a resolved path of `/bin/cp`. The code then
clears that file, resulting in the `cp` binary effectively being
removed from the system. An attacker needs to be able to login as a
user with a constructed username. Given that such a username is
unlikely to exist on an existing system, they will also need to be
able to create the users with the constructed usernames. The issue is
patched in version 0.2.1 of sudo-rs. Sudo-rs now uses the uid for the
user instead of their username for determining the filename. Note that
an upgrade to this version will result in existing session files being
ignored and users will be forced to re-authenticate. It also fully
eliminates any possibility of path traversal, given that uids are
always integer values. The `sudo -K` and `sudo -k` commands can run,
even if a user has no sudo access. As a workaround, make sure that
one's system does not contain any users with a specially crafted
username. While this is the case and while untrusted users do not have
the ability to create arbitrary users on the system, one should not be
able to exploit this issue.

plone.rest allows users to use HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT,
DELETE, etc. in Plone. Starting in the 2.x branch and prior to
versions 2.0.1 and 3.0.1, when the `++api++` traverser is accidentally
used multiple times in a url, handling it takes increasingly longer,
making the server less responsive. Patches are available in
`plone.rest` 2.0.1 and 3.0.1. Series 1.x is not affected. As a
workaround, one may redirect `/++api++/++api++` to `/++api++` in one's
frontend web server (nginx, Apache).

Zope is an open-source web application server. Prior to versions
4.8.10 and 5.8.5, there is a stored cross site scripting vulnerability
for SVG images. Note that an image tag with an SVG image as source is
never vulnerable, even when the SVG image contains malicious code. To
exploit the vulnerability, an attacker would first need to upload an
image, and then trick a user into following a specially crafted link.
Patches are available in Zope 4.8.10 and 5.8.5. As a workaround, make
sure the "Add Documents, Images, and Files" permission is only
assigned to trusted roles. By default, only the Manager has this
permission.

attackers control which could lead to a double free. This issue has
been addressed in versions 2.12.0, 2.11.3, 2.10.3, and 2.6.7. Users
are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this

A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in the Spotlight RPC
functions in afpd in Netatalk 3.1.x before 3.1.17. When parsing
Spotlight RPC packets, one encoded data structure is a key-value style
dictionary where the keys are character strings, and the values can be
any of the supported types in the underlying protocol. Due to a lack
of type checking in callers of the dalloc_value_for_key() function,
which returns the object associated with a key, a malicious actor may
be able to fully control the value of the pointer and theoretically
achieve Remote Code Execution on the host. This issue is similar to
CVE-2023-34967.

Improper Input Validation, Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
vulnerability in Apache Commons Compress in TAR parsing.This issue
affects Apache Commons Compress: from 1.22 before 1.24.0. Users are
recommended to upgrade to version 1.24.0, which fixes the issue. A
third party can create a malformed TAR file by manipulating file
modification times headers, which when parsed with Apache Commons
Compress, will cause a denial of service issue via CPU consumption. In
version 1.22 of Apache Commons Compress, support was added for file
modification times with higher precision (issue # COMPRESS-612 [1]).
The format for the PAX extended headers carrying this data consists of
two numbers separated by a period [2], indicating seconds and
subsecond precision (for example &#8220;1647221103.5998539&#8221;). The impacted
fields are &#8220;atime&#8221;, &#8220;ctime&#8221;, &#8220;mtime&#8221; and &#8220;LIBARCHIVE.creationtime&#8221;. No
input validation is performed prior to the parsing of header values.
Parsing of these numbers uses the BigDecimal [3] class from the JDK
which has a publicly known algorithmic complexity issue when doing
operations on large numbers, causing denial of service (see issue #
JDK-6560193 [4]). A third party can manipulate file time headers in a
TAR file by placing a number with a very long fraction (300,000
digits) or a number with exponent notation (such as &#8220;9e9999999&#8221;)
within a file modification time header, and the parsing of files with
these headers will take hours instead of seconds, leading to a denial
of service via exhaustion of CPU resources. This issue is similar to
CVE-2012-2098 [5]. [1]:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMPRESS-612 [2]: https://pubs.o

Reference: URL:https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2023-42669.html

A vulnerability was found in Samba's "rpcecho" development server, a
non-Windows RPC server used to test Samba's DCE/RPC stack elements.
This vulnerability stems from an RPC function that can be blocked
indefinitely. The issue arises because the "rpcecho" service operates
with only one worker in the main RPC task, allowing calls to the
"rpcecho" server to be blocked for a specified time, causing service
disruptions. This disruption is triggered by a "sleep()" call in the
"dcesrv_echo_TestSleep()" function under specific conditions.
Authenticated users or attackers can exploit this vulnerability to
make calls to the "rpcecho" server, requesting it to block for a
specified duration, effectively disrupting most services and leading
to a complete denial of service on the AD DC. The DoS affects all
other services as "rpcecho" runs in the main RPC task.

A flaw was found in Samba. It is susceptible to a vulnerability where
multiple incompatible RPC listeners can be initiated, causing
disruptions in the AD DC service. When Samba's RPC server experiences
a high load or unresponsiveness, servers intended for non-AD DC
purposes (for example, NT4-emulation "classic DCs") can erroneously
start and compete for the same unix domain sockets. This issue leads
to partial query responses from the AD DC, causing issues such as "The
procedure number is out of range" when using tools like Active
Directory Users. This flaw allows an attacker to disrupt AD DC
services.

The Photospace Responsive plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
Cross-Site Scripting via the &#8216;psres_button_size&#8217; parameter in versions
up to, and including, 2.1.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and
output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary
web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an
injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

A flaw was found in the exFAT driver of the Linux kernel. The
vulnerability exists in the implementation of the file name
reconstruction function, which is responsible for reading file name
entries from a directory index and merging file name parts belonging
to one file into a single long file name. Since the file name
characters are copied into a stack variable, a local privileged
attacker could use this flaw to overflow the kernel stack.

An array indexing vulnerability was found in the netfilter subsystem
of the Linux kernel. A missing macro could lead to a miscalculation of
the `h->nets` array offset, providing attackers with the primitive to
arbitrarily increment/decrement a memory buffer out-of-bound. This
issue may allow a local user to crash the system or potentially
escalate their privileges on the system.

A NULL pointer dereference flaw was found in the Linux kernel ipv4
stack. The socket buffer (skb) was assumed to be associated with a
device before calling __ip_options_compile, which is not always the
case if the skb is re-routed by ipvs. This issue may allow a local
user with CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges to crash the system.
