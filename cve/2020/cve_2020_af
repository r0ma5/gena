Sagemcom F@ST 5280 routers using firmware version 1.150.61 have
insecure deserialization that allows any authenticated user to perform
a privilege escalation to any other user. By making a request with
valid sess_id, nonce, and ha1 values inside of the serialized session
cookie, an attacker may alter the user value inside of this cookie,
and assume the role and permissions of the user specified. By assuming
the role of the user internal, which is inaccessible to end users by
default, the attacker gains the permissions of the internal account,
which includes the ability to flash custom firmware to the router,
allowing the attacker to achieve a complete compromise.

execution of a small number of tools of the operating system. The
restricted shell can be bypassed by presenting a fake vmware-tools ISO
image to the guest virtual machine running SpamTitan Gateway. This ISO
image should contain a valid Perl script at the vmware-freebsd-
tools/vmware-tools-distrib/vmware-install.pl path. The fake ISO image
will be mounted and the script wmware-install.pl will be executed with
super-user privileges as soon as the hidden option to install VMware
Tools is selected in the main menu of the restricted shell (option

A sandbox escape issue was discovered in TitanHQ SpamTitan Gateway
7.07. It limits the admin user to a restricted shell, allowing
execution of a small number of tools of the operating system. This
restricted shell can be bypassed after changing the properties of the
user admin in the operating system file /etc/passwd. This file cannot
be accessed though the restricted shell, but it can be modified by
abusing the Backup/Import Backup functionality of the web interface.
An authenticated attacker would be able to obtain the file
/var/tmp/admin.passwd after executing a Backup operation. This file
can be manually modified to change the GUID of the user to 0 (root)
and change the restricted shell to a normal shell /bin/sh. After the
modification is done, the file can be recompressed to a .tar.bz file
and imported again via the Import Backup functionality. The properties
of the admin user will be overwritten and a root shell will be granted
to the user upon the next successful login.

The 802.11 standard that underpins Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA, WPA2,
and WPA3) and Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) doesn't require that
received fragments be cleared from memory after (re)connecting to a
network. Under the right circumstances, when another device sends
fragmented frames encrypted using WEP, CCMP, or GCMP, this can be
abused to inject arbitrary network packets and/or exfiltrate user
data.

Name: CVE-2020-24658
Status: Candidate
Reference: CONFIRM:https://developer.arm.com/support/arm-security-updates/arm-compiler-5-stack-protection

Arm Compiler 5 through 5.06u6 has an error in a stack protection
feature designed to help spot stack-based buffer overflows in local
arrays. When this feature is enabled, a protected function writes a
guard value to the stack prior to (above) any vulnerable arrays in the
stack. The guard value is checked for corruption on function return;
corruption leads to an error-handler call. In certain circumstances,
the reference value that is compared against the guard value is itself
also written to the stack (after any vulnerable arrays). The reference
value is written to the stack when the function runs out of registers
to use for other temporary data. If both the reference value and the
guard value are written to the stack, then the stack protection will
fail to spot corruption when both values are overwritten with the same
value. For both the reference value and the guard value to be
corrupted, there would need to be both a buffer overflow and a buffer
underflow in the vulnerable arrays (or some other vulnerability that
causes two separated stack entries to be corrupted).

a NULL pointer dereference in a TLS 1.3 client if a no_renegotiation
alert is sent with unexpected timing, and then an invalid second
handshake occurs. The crash happens in the application's error
handling path, where the gnutls_deinit function is called after
detecting a handshake failure.

The affected versions of S+ Operations (version 2.1 SP1 and earlier)
used an approach for user authentication which relies on validation at
the client node (client-side authentication). This is not as secure as
having the server validate a client application before allowing a

these applications are not protected, unauthorized actors can bypass
authentication and make unauthorized connections to the server
application.

LogRhythm Platform Manager 7.4.9 allows Command Injection. To exploit

Reference: MISC:https://cybercx.com.au/blog/2020/12/15/logrhythm-zero-days/

LogRhythm Platform Manager (PM) 7.4.9 allows CSRF. The Web interface
is vulnerable to Cross-site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWH). If a logged-in
PM user visits a malicious site in the same browser session, that site
can perform a CSRF attack to create a WebSocket from the victim client
to the vulnerable PM server. Once the socket is created, the malicious
site can interact with the vulnerable web server in the context of the
logged-in user. This can include WebSocket payloads that result in
command execution.

LogRhythm Platform Manager (PM) 7.4.9 has Incorrect Access Control.
Users within LogRhythm can be delegated different roles and
privileges, intended to limit what data and services they can interact
with. However, no access control is enforced for WebSocket-based
communication to the PM application server, which will forward
requests to any configured back-end server, regardless of whether the
user's access rights should permit this. As a result, even the most
low-privileged user can interact with any back-end component that has
a LogRhythm agent installed.

TeamworkCloud 18.0 thru 19.0 allows a local unprivileged attacker to
execute arbitrary code as root. During installation, the user is
instructed to set the system enviroment file with world writable
permissions (0777 /etc/environment). Any local unprivileged user can
execute arbitrary code simply by writing to /etc/environment, which
will force all users, including root, to execute arbitrary code during
the next login or reboot. In addition, the entire home directory of
the twcloud user at /home/twcloud is recursively given world writable
permissions. This allows any local unprivileged attacker to execute
arbitrary code, as twcloud. This product was previous named Cameo

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. The PCI passthrough
code improperly uses register data. Code paths in Xen's MSI handling
have been identified that act on unsanitized values read back from
device hardware registers. While devices strictly compliant with PCI
specifications shouldn't be able to affect these registers, experience
shows that it's very common for devices to have out-of-spec "backdoor"
operations that can affect the result of these reads. A not fully
trusted guest may be able to crash Xen, leading to a Denial of Service
(DoS) for the entire system. Privilege escalation and information
leaks cannot be excluded. All versions of Xen supporting PCI
passthrough are affected. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. Arm systems
are not vulnerable. Only guests with passed through PCI devices may be
able to leverage the vulnerability. Only systems passing through
devices with out-of-spec ("backdoor") functionality can cause issues.
Experience shows that such out-of-spec functionality is common; unless
you have reason to believe that your device does not have such
functionality, it's better to assume that it does.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. x86 PV guest kernels
can experience denial of service via SYSENTER. The SYSENTER
instruction leaves various state sanitization activities to software.
One of Xen's sanitization paths injects a #GP fault, and incorrectly
delivers it twice to the guest. This causes the guest kernel to
observe a kernel-privilege #GP fault (typically fatal) rather than a
user-privilege #GP fault (usually converted into SIGSEGV/etc.).
Malicious or buggy userspace can crash the guest kernel, resulting in
a VM Denial of Service. All versions of Xen from 3.2 onwards are
vulnerable. Only x86 systems are vulnerable. ARM platforms are not
vulnerable. Only x86 systems that support the SYSENTER instruction in
64bit mode are vulnerable. This is believed to be Intel, Centaur, and
Shanghai CPUs. AMD and Hygon CPUs are not believed to be vulnerable.
Only x86 PV guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 PVH / HVM guests
cannot exploit the vulnerability.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is mishandling of
the constraint that once-valid event channels may not turn invalid.
Logic in the handling of event channel operations in Xen assumes that
an event channel, once valid, will not become invalid over the life
time of a guest. However, operations like the resetting of all event
channels may involve decreasing one of the bounds checked when
determining validity. This may lead to bug checks triggering, crashing
the host. An unprivileged guest may be able to crash Xen, leading to a
Denial of Service (DoS) for the entire system. All Xen versions from
4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen versions 4.3 and earlier are not
vulnerable. Only systems with untrusted guests permitted to create
more than the default number of event channels are vulnerable. This
number depends on the architecture and type of guest. For 32-bit x86
PV guests, this is 1023; for 64-bit x86 PV guests, and for all ARM
guests, this number is 4095. Systems where untrusted guests are
limited to fewer than this number are not vulnerable. Note that xl and
libxl limit max_event_channels to 1023 by default, so systems using
exclusively xl, libvirt+libxl, or their own toolstack based on libxl,
and not explicitly setting max_event_channels, are not vulnerable.

An issue was discovered in Xen 4.14.x. There is a missing unlock in
the XENMEM_acquire_resource error path. The RCU (Read, Copy, Update)
mechanism is a synchronisation primitive. A buggy error path in the
XENMEM_acquire_resource exits without releasing an RCU reference,
which is conceptually similar to forgetting to unlock a spinlock. A
buggy or malicious HVM stubdomain can cause an RCU reference to be
leaked. This causes subsequent administration operations, (e.g., CPU
offline) to livelock, resulting in a host Denial of Service. The buggy
codepath has been present since Xen 4.12. Xen 4.14 and later are
vulnerable to the DoS. The side effects are believed to be benign on
Xen 4.12 and 4.13, but patches are provided nevertheless. The
vulnerability can generally only be exploited by x86 HVM VMs, as these
are generally the only type of VM that have a Qemu stubdomain. x86 PV
and PVH domains, as well as ARM VMs, typically don't use a stubdomain.
Only VMs using HVM stubdomains can exploit the vulnerability. VMs
using PV stubdomains, or with emulators running in dom0, cannot
exploit the vulnerability.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. Out of bounds event
channels are available to 32-bit x86 domains. The so called 2-level
event channel model imposes different limits on the number of usable
event channels for 32-bit x86 domains vs 64-bit or Arm (either
bitness) ones. 32-bit x86 domains can use only 1023 channels, due to
limited space in their shared (between guest and Xen) information
structure, whereas all other domains can use up to 4095 in this model.
The recording of the respective limit during domain initialization,
however, has occurred at a time where domains are still deemed to be
64-bit ones, prior to actually honoring respective domain properties.
At the point domains get recognized as 32-bit ones, the limit didn't
get updated accordingly. Due to this misbehavior in Xen, 32-bit
domains (including Domain 0) servicing other domains may observe event
channel allocations to succeed when they should really fail.
Subsequent use of such event channels would then possibly lead to
corruption of other parts of the shared info structure. An
unprivileged guest may cause another domain, in particular Domain 0,
to misbehave. This may lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) for the
entire system. All Xen versions from 4.4 onwards are vulnerable. Xen
versions 4.3 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86 32-bit domains
servicing other domains are vulnerable. Arm systems, as well as x86
64-bit domains, are not vulnerable.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a lack of
preemption in evtchn_reset() / evtchn_destroy(). In particular, the
FIFO event channel model allows guests to have a large number of event
channels active at a time. Closing all of these (when resetting all
event channels or when cleaning up after the guest) may take extended
periods of time. So far, there was no arrangement for preemption at
suitable intervals, allowing a CPU to spend an almost unbounded amount
of time in the processing of these operations. Malicious or buggy
guest kernels can mount a Denial of Service (DoS) attack affecting the
entire system. All Xen versions are vulnerable in principle. Whether
versions 4.3 and older are vulnerable depends on underlying hardware
characteristics.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. An x86 PV guest can
trigger a host OS crash when handling guest access to MSR_MISC_ENABLE.
When a guest accesses certain Model Specific Registers, Xen first
reads the value from hardware to use as the basis for auditing the
guest access. For the MISC_ENABLE MSR, which is an Intel specific MSR,
this MSR read is performed without error handling for a #GP fault,
which is the consequence of trying to read this MSR on non-Intel
hardware. A buggy or malicious PV guest administrator can crash Xen,
resulting in a host Denial of Service. Only x86 systems are
vulnerable. ARM systems are not vulnerable. Only Xen versions 4.11 and
onwards are vulnerable. 4.10 and earlier are not vulnerable. Only x86
systems that do not implement the MISC_ENABLE MSR (0x1a0) are
vulnerable. AMD and Hygon systems do not implement this MSR and are
vulnerable. Intel systems do implement this MSR and are not
vulnerable. Other manufacturers have not been checked. Only x86 PV
guests can exploit the vulnerability. x86 HVM/PVH guests cannot
exploit the vulnerability.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There are missing
memory barriers when accessing/allocating an event channel. Event
channels control structures can be accessed lockless as long as the
port is considered to be valid. Such a sequence is missing an
appropriate memory barrier (e.g., smp_*mb()) to prevent both the
compiler and CPU from re-ordering access. A malicious guest may be
able to cause a hypervisor crash resulting in a Denial of Service
(DoS). Information leak and privilege escalation cannot be excluded.
Systems running all versions of Xen are affected. Whether a system is
vulnerable will depend on the CPU and compiler used to build Xen. For
all systems, the presence and the scope of the vulnerability depend on
the precise re-ordering performed by the compiler used to build Xen.
We have not been able to survey compilers; consequently we cannot say
which compiler(s) might produce vulnerable code (with which code
generation options). GCC documentation clearly suggests that re-
ordering is possible. Arm systems will also be vulnerable if the CPU
is able to re-order memory access. Please consult your CPU vendor. x86
systems are only vulnerable if a compiler performs re-ordering.

An issue was discovered in Xen through 4.14.x. There is a race
condition when migrating timers between x86 HVM vCPUs. When migrating
timers of x86 HVM guests between its vCPUs, the locking model used
allows for a second vCPU of the same guest (also operating on the
timers) to release a lock that it didn't acquire. The most likely
effect of the issue is a hang or crash of the hypervisor, i.e., a
Denial of Service (DoS). All versions of Xen are affected. Only x86
systems are vulnerable. Arm systems are not vulnerable. Only x86 HVM
guests can leverage the vulnerability. x86 PV and PVH cannot leverage
the vulnerability. Only guests with more than one vCPU can exploit the
vulnerability.

A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06. The rmmod
implementation allows the unloading of a module used as a dependency
without checking if any other dependent module is still loaded leading
to a use-after-free scenario. This could allow arbitrary code to be
executed or a bypass of Secure Boot protections. The highest threat
from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as
well as system availability.

A call to ConformPixelInfo() in the SetImageAlphaChannel() routine of

WriteOnePNGImage() from coders/png.c (the PNG coder) has a for loop
with an improper exit condition that can allow an out-of-bounds READ
via heap-buffer-overflow. This occurs because it is possible for the
colormap to have less than 256 valid values but the loop condition
will loop 256 times, attempting to pass invalid colormap data to the
event logger. The patch replaces the hardcoded 256 value with a call
to MagickMin() to ensure the proper value is used. This could impact
application availability when a specially crafted input file is
processed by ImageMagick. This flaw affects ImageMagick versions prior
to 7.0.8-68.

In the CropImage() and CropImageToTiles() routines of
MagickCore/transform.c, rounding calculations performed on
unconstrained pixel offsets was causing undefined behavior in the form
of integer overflow and out-of-range values as reported by
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer. Such issues could cause a negative impact

packets before validating them with DNSSEC data. An attacker on the
network, who can create valid DNS replies, could use this flaw to

rfc1035.c:extract_name() function, which writes data to the memory
pointed by name assuming MAXDNAME*2 bytes are available in the buffer.
However, in some code execution paths, it is possible extract_name()
gets passed an offset from the base buffer, thus reducing, in
practice, the number of available bytes that can be written in the
buffer. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data
confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00027.html

A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply
from a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in the forward.c:reply_query()
if the reply destination address/port is used by the pending forwarded
queries. However, it does not use the address/port to retrieve the
exact forwarded query, substantially reducing the number of attempts
an attacker on the network would have to perform to forge a reply and
get it accepted by dnsmasq. This issue contrasts with RFC5452, which
specifies a query's attributes that all must be used to match a reply.
This flaw allows an attacker to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack.
If chained with CVE-2020-25685 or CVE-2020-25686, the attack
complexity of a successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from
this vulnerability is to data integrity.

A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When getting a reply
from a forwarded query, dnsmasq checks in forward.c:reply_query(),
which is the forwarded query that matches the reply, by only using a
weak hash of the query name. Due to the weak hash (CRC32 when dnsmasq
is compiled without DNSSEC, SHA-1 when it is) this flaw allows an off-
path attacker to find several different domains all having the same
hash, substantially reducing the number of attempts they would have to
perform to forge a reply and get it accepted by dnsmasq. This is in
contrast with RFC5452, which specifies that the query name is one of
the attributes of a query that must be used to match a reply. This
flaw could be abused to perform a DNS Cache Poisoning attack. If
chained with CVE-2020-25684 the attack complexity of a successful
attack is reduced. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to
data integrity.

A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. When receiving a
query, dnsmasq does not check for an existing pending request for the
same name and forwards a new request. By default, a maximum of 150
pending queries can be sent to upstream servers, so there can be at
most 150 queries for the same name. This flaw allows an off-path
attacker on the network to substantially reduce the number of attempts
that it would have to perform to forge a reply and have it accepted by
dnsmasq. This issue is mentioned in the "Birthday Attacks" section of
RFC5452. If chained with CVE-2020-25684, the attack complexity of a
successful attack is reduced. The highest threat from this

A flaw was found in dnsmasq before version 2.83. A heap-based buffer
overflow was discovered in dnsmasq when DNSSEC is enabled and before
it validates the received DNS entries. This flaw allows a remote
attacker, who can create valid DNS replies, to cause an overflow in a
heap-allocated memory. This flaw is caused by the lack of length
checks in rfc1035.c:extract_name(), which could be abused to make the
code execute memcpy() with a negative size in sort_rrset() and cause a
crash in dnsmasq, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat
from this vulnerability is to system availability.

A flaw was found in rhacm versions before 2.0.5 and before 2.1.0. Two
internal service APIs were incorrectly provisioned using a test
certificate from the source repository. This would result in all
installations using the same certificates. If an attacker could
observe network traffic internal to a cluster, they could use the
private key to decode API requests that should be protected by TLS
sessions, potentially obtaining information they would not otherwise
be able to. These certificates are not used for service
authentication, so no opportunity for impersonation or active MITM
attacks were made possible.

XSS related to jQuery can occur. The attacker creates a message with
[javascript:payload xss] and turns it into a jQuery object with
mw.message().parse(). The expected result is that the jQuery object
does not contain an <a> tag (or it does not have a href attribute, or
it's empty, etc.). The actual result is that the object contains an <a

SilverStripe through 4.6.0-rc1 has an XXE Vulnerability in
CSSContentParser. A developer utility meant for parsing HTML within
unit tests can be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
When this developer utility is misused for purposes involving external
or user submitted data in custom project code, it can lead to
vulnerabilities such as XSS on HTML output rendered through this
custom code. This is now mitigated by disabling external entities
during parsing. (The correct CVE ID year is 2020 [CVE-2020-25817, not
CVE-2021-25817]).

An issue was discovered in MediaWiki before 1.31.10 and 1.32.x through

mw.message().parse() doesn't escape HTML. This affects both message
contents (which are generally safe) and the parameters (which can be
based on user input). (When jqueryMsg is loaded, it correctly accepts
only whitelisted tags in message contents, and escapes all parameters.

for example occur for Special:SpecialPages on a wiki with no

The DNS feature in InterNiche NicheStack TCP/IP 4.0.1 is affected by:
Buffer Overflow. The impact is: execute arbitrary code (remote). The
component is: DNS response processing functions: dns_upcall(),
getoffset(), dnc_set_answer(). The attack vector is: a specific DNS
response packet. The code does not check the "response data length"
field of individual DNS answers, which may cause out-of-bounds
read/write operations, leading to Information leak, Denial-or-Service,
or Remote Code Execution, depending on the context.

A component of Kaspersky custom boot loader allowed loading of
untrusted UEFI modules due to insufficient check of their
authenticity. This component is incorporated in Kaspersky Rescue Disk
(KRD) and was trusted by the Authentication Agent of Full Disk
Encryption in Kaspersky Endpoint Security (KES). This issue allowed to
bypass the UEFI Secure Boot security feature. An attacker would need
physical access to the computer to exploit it. Otherwise, local
administrator privileges would be required to modify the boot loader
component.

GLPI stands for Gestionnaire Libre de Parc Informatique and it is a
Free Asset and IT Management Software package, that provides ITIL
Service Desk features, licenses tracking and software auditing. In
GLPI before version 9.5.3, any authenticated user has read-only
permissions to the planning of every other user, even admin ones.
Steps to reproduce the behavior: 1. Create a new planning with
'eduardo.mozart' user (from 'IT' group that belongs to 'Super-admin')
into it's personal planning at 'Assistance' > 'Planning'. 2. Copy the
CalDAV url and use a CalDAV client (e.g. Thunderbird) to sync the
planning with the provided URL. 3. Inform the username and password
from any valid user (e.g. 'camila' from 'Proativa' group). 4. 'Camila'
has read-only access to 'eduardo.mozart' personal planning. The same
behavior happens to any group. E.g. 'Camila' has access to 'IT' group
planning, even if she doesn't belong to this group and has a 'Self-
service' profile permission). This issue is fixed in version 9.5.3. As
a workaround, one can remove the `caldav.php` file to block access to
CalDAV server.

Dependabot is a set of packages for automated dependency management
for Ruby, JavaScript, Python, PHP, Elixir, Rust, Java, .NET, Elm and
Go. In Dependabot-Core from version 0.119.0.beta1 before version
0.125.1, there is a remote code execution vulnerability in dependabot-
common and dependabot-go_modules when a source branch name contains
malicious injectable bash code. For example, if Dependabot is
configured to use the following source branch name:
"/$({curl,127.0.0.1})", Dependabot will make a HTTP request to the
following URL: 127.0.0.1 when cloning the source repository. The fix
was applied to version 0.125.1. As a workaround, one can escape the
branch name prior to passing it to the Dependabot::Source class.

Radar COVID is the official COVID-19 exposure notification app for
Spain. In affected versions of Radar COVID, identification and de-
anonymization of COVID-19 positive users that upload Radar COVID TEKs
to the Radar COVID server is possible. This vulnerability enables the
identification and de-anonymization of COVID-19 positive users when
using Radar COVID. The vulnerability is caused by the fact that Radar
COVID connections to the server (uploading of TEKs to the backend) are
only made by COVID-19 positives. Therefore, any on-path observer with
the ability to monitor traffic between the app and the server can
identify which users had a positive test. Such an adversary can be the
mobile network operator (MNO) if the connection is done through a
mobile network, the Internet Service Provider (ISP) if the connection
is done through the Internet (e.g., a home network), a VPN provider
used by the user, the local network operator in the case of enterprise
networks, or any eavesdropper with access to the same network (WiFi or
Ethernet) as the user as could be the case of public WiFi hotspots
deployed at shopping centers, airports, hotels, and coffee shops. The
attacker may also de-anonymize the user. For this additional stage to
succeed, the adversary needs to correlate Radar COVID traffic to other
identifiable information from the victim. This could be achieved by
associating the connection to a contract with the name of the victim
or by associating Radar COVID traffic to other user-generated flows
containing identifiers in the clear (e.g., HTTP cookies or other
mobile flows sending unique identifiers like the IMEI or the AAID
without encryption). The former can be executed, for instance, by the
Internet Service Provider or the MNO. The latter can be executed by
any on-path adversary, such as the network provider or even the cloud
provider that hosts more than one service accessed by the victim. The
farther the adversary is either from the victim (the client) or the
end-point (the server), the less likely it may be that the adversary
has access to re-identification information. The vulnerability has
been mitigated with the injection of dummy traffic from the
application to the backend. Dummy traffic is generated by all users
independently of whether they are COVID-19 positive or not. The issue
was fixed in iOS in version 1.0.8 (uniform distribution), 1.1.0
(exponential distribution), Android in version 1.0.7 (uniform
distribution), 1.1.0 (exponential distribution), Backend in version
1.1.2-RELEASE. For more information see the referenced GitHub Security
Advisory.

October is a free, open-source, self-hosted CMS platform based on the
Laravel PHP Framework. A bypass of CVE-2020-15247 (fixed in 1.0.469
and 1.1.0) was discovered that has the same impact as CVE-2020-15247.
An authenticated backend user with the cms.manage_pages,
cms.manage_layouts, or cms.manage_partials permissions who would
normally not be permitted to provide PHP code to be executed by the
CMS due to cms.enableSafeMode being enabled is able to write specific
Twig code to escape the Twig sandbox and execute arbitrary PHP. This
is not a problem for anyone that trusts their users with those
permissions to normally write & manage PHP within the CMS by not
having cms.enableSafeMode enabled, but would be a problem for anyone
relying on cms.enableSafeMode to ensure that users with those
permissions in production do not have access to write & execute
arbitrary PHP. Issue has been patched in Build 470 (v1.0.470) and
v1.1.1.

Git Credential Manager Core (GCM Core) is a secure Git credential
helper built on .NET Core that runs on Windows and macOS. In Git
Credential Manager Core before version 2.0.289, when recursively
cloning a Git repository on Windows with submodules, Git will first
clone the top-level repository and then recursively clone all
submodules by starting new Git processes from the top-level working
directory. If a malicious git.exe executable is present in the top-
level repository then this binary will be started by Git Credential
Manager Core when attempting to read configuration, and not git.exe as
found on the %PATH%. This only affects GCM Core on Windows, not macOS
or Linux-based distributions. GCM Core version 2.0.289 contains the
fix for this vulnerability, and is available from the project's GitHub
releases page. GCM Core 2.0.289 is also bundled in the latest Git for
Windows release; version 2.29.2(3). As a workaround, users should
avoid recursively cloning untrusted repositories with the --recurse-
submodules option.

verification of its HTTP client used for a large portion of Opencast's
HTTP requests. Hostname verification is an important part when using
HTTPS to ensure that the presented certificate is valid for the host.
Disabling it can allow for man-in-the-middle attacks. This problem is
fixed in Opencast 7.9 and Opencast 8.8 Please be aware that fixing the
problem means that Opencast will not simply accept any self-signed
certificates any longer without properly importing them. If you need
those, please make sure to import them into the Java key store. Better

login for user, and is given the same verification code. 3. User
comments code as part of their normal login. 4. Before user can,
attacker completes the login process now that the code is commented.
5. User gets a failed login and attacker now has control of the
account. Since commit a603769 starting a login twice will generate
different verification codes, causing both user and attacker login to
fail. For clients that rely on a clone of ScratchVerifier not hosted
by the developers, their users may attempt to finish the login process
as soon as possible after commenting the code. There is no reliable
way for the attacker to know before the user can finish the process
that the user has commented the code, so this vulnerability only
really affects those who comment the code and then take several
seconds before finishing the login.

Highlight.js is a syntax highlighter written in JavaScript.
Highlight.js versions before 9.18.2 and 10.1.2 are vulnerable to
Prototype Pollution. A malicious HTML code block can be crafted that
will result in prototype pollution of the base object's prototype
during highlighting. If you allow users to insert custom HTML code
blocks into your page/app via parsing Markdown code blocks (or
similar) and do not filter the language names the user can provide you
may be vulnerable. The pollution should just be harmless data but this
can cause problems for applications not expecting these properties to
exist and can result in strange behavior or application crashes, i.e.
a potential DOS vector. If your website or application does not render
user provided data it should be unaffected. Versions 9.18.2 and 10.1.2
and newer include fixes for this vulnerability. If you are using
version 7 or 8 you are encouraged to upgrade to a newer release.

Cron-utils is a Java library to parse, validate, migrate crons as well
as get human readable descriptions for them. In cron-utils before
version 9.1.3, a template Injection vulnerability is present. This
enables attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL expressions, leading to
unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability. Only
projects using the @Cron annotation to validate untrusted Cron
expressions are affected. This issue was patched in version 9.1.3.

Scratch Addons is a WebExtension that supports both Chrome and
Firefox. Scratch Addons before version 1.3.2 is vulnerable to DOM-

addon of the Scratch Addons extension used incorrect regular
expression which caused the HTML-escaped values to be unescaped,
leading to XSS. Scratch Addons version 1.3.2 fixes the bug. The
extension will be automatically updated by the browser. More Links

Go Ethereum, or "Geth", is the official Golang implementation of the
Ethereum protocol. An ethash mining DAG generation flaw in Geth before
version 1.9.24 could cause miners to erroneously calculate PoW in an
upcoming epoch (estimated early January, 2021). This happened on the
ETC chain on 2020-11-06. This issue is relevant only for miners, non-
mining nodes are unaffected. This issue is fixed as of 1.9.24

Go Ethereum, or "Geth", is the official Golang implementation of the
Ethereum protocol. This is a Consensus vulnerability in Geth before
version 1.9.17 which can be used to cause a chain-split where
vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain. Geth's pre-compiled
dataCopy (at 0x00...04) contract did a shallow copy on invocation. An
attacker could deploy a contract that writes X to an EVM memory region
R, then calls 0x00..04 with R as an argument, then overwrites R to Y,
and finally invokes the RETURNDATACOPY opcode. When this contract is
invoked, a consensus-compliant node would push X on the EVM stack,
whereas Geth would push Y. This is fixed in version 1.9.17.

Nanopb is a small code-size Protocol Buffers implementation. In Nanopb
before versions 0.4.4 and 0.3.9.7, decoding specifically formed
message can leak memory if dynamic allocation is enabled and an oneof
field contains a static submessage that contains a dynamic field, and
the message being decoded contains the submessage multiple times. This
is rare in normal messages, but it is a concern when untrusted data is
parsed. This is fixed in versions 0.3.9.7 and 0.4.4. The following
workarounds are available: 1) Set the option `no_unions` for the oneof
field. This will generate fields as separate instead of C union, and
avoids triggering the problematic code. 2) Set the type of the
submessage field inside oneof to `FT_POINTER`. This way the whole
submessage will be dynamically allocated and the problematic code is
not executed. 3) Use an arena allocator for nanopb, to make sure all
memory can be released afterwards.

1) The IdToken signature algorithm was not checked automatically, but
only if the expected algorithm was passed in as a kwarg. 2) JWA `none`
algorithm was allowed in all flows. 3)
oic.consumer.Consumer.parse_authz returns an unverified IdToken. The

OAuthenticator is an OAuth login mechanism for JupyterHub. In
oauthenticator from version 0.12.0 and before 0.12.2, the deprecated
(in jupyterhub 1.2) configuration `Authenticator.whitelist`, which
should be transparently mapped to `Authenticator.allowed_users` with a
warning, is instead ignored by OAuthenticator classes, resulting in
the same behavior as if this configuration has not been set. If this
is the only mechanism of authorization restriction (i.e. no group or
team restrictions in configuration) then all authenticated users will
be allowed. Provider-based restrictions, including deprecated values
such as `GitHubOAuthenticator.org_whitelist` are **not** affected. All
users of OAuthenticator 0.12.0 and 0.12.1 with JupyterHub 1.2
(JupyterHub Helm chart 0.10.0-0.10.5) who use the
`admin.whitelist.users` configuration in the jupyterhub helm chart or
the `c.Authenticator.whitelist` configuration directly. Users of other
deprecated configuration, e.g. `c.GitHubOAuthenticator.team_whitelist`
are **not** affected. If you see a log line like this and expect a
specific list of allowed usernames: "[I 2020-11-27 16:51:54.528
JupyterHub app:1717] Not using allowed_users. Any authenticated user
will be allowed." you are likely affected. Updating oauthenticator to
0.12.2 is recommended. A workaround is to replace the deprecated
`c.Authenticator.whitelist = ...` with `c.Authenticator.allowed_users
= ...`. If any users have been authorized during this time who should
not have been, they must be deleted via the API or admin interface,
per the referenced documentation.

Open Zaak is a modern, open-source data- and services-layer to enable
zaakgericht werken, a Dutch approach to case management. In Open Zaak
before version 1.3.3 the Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing policy in Open
Zaak is currently wide open - every client is allowed. This allows
evil.com to run scripts that perform AJAX calls to known Open Zaak
installations, and the browser will not block these. This was intended
to only apply to development machines running on localhost/127.0.0.1.
Open Zaak 1.3.3 disables CORS by default, while it can be opted-in
through environment variables. The vulnerability does not actually
seem exploitable because: a) The session cookie has a `Same-Site: Lax`
policy which prevents it from being sent along in Cross-Origin
requests. b) All pages that give access to (production) data are
login-protected c) `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` is set to
`false` d) CSRF checks probably block the remote origin, since they're
not explicitly added to the trusted allowlist.

Kirby is a CMS. In Kirby CMS (getkirby/cms) before version 3.3.6, and
Kirby Panel before version 2.5.14 there is a vulnerability in which
the admin panel may be accessed if hosted on a .dev domain. In order
to protect new installations on public servers that don't have an
admin account for the Panel yet, we block account registration there
by default. This is a security feature, which we implemented years ago
in Kirby 2. It helps to avoid that you forget registering your first
admin account on a public server. In this case &#8211; without our security
block &#8211; someone else might theoretically be able to find your site,
find out it's running on Kirby, find the Panel and then register the
account first. It's an unlikely situation, but it's still a certain
risk. To be able to register the first Panel account on a public
server, you have to enforce the installer via a config setting. This
helps to push all users to the best practice of registering your first
Panel account on your local machine and upload it together with the
rest of the site. This installation block implementation in Kirby
versions before 3.3.6 still assumed that .dev domains are local
domains, which is no longer true. In the meantime, those domains
became publicly available. This means that our installation block is
no longer working as expected if you use a .dev domain for your Kirby
site. Additionally the local installation check may also fail if your
site is behind a reverse proxy. You are only affected if you use a
.dev domain or your site is behind a reverse proxy and you have not
yet registered your first Panel account on the public server and
someone finds your site and tries to login at `yourdomain.dev/panel`
before you register your first account. You are not affected if you
have already created one or multiple Panel accounts (no matter if on a
.dev domain or behind a reverse proxy). The problem has been patched
in Kirby 3.3.6. Please upgrade to this or a later version to fix the
vulnerability.

omniauth-apple is the OmniAuth strategy for "Sign In with Apple"
(RubyGem omniauth-apple). In omniauth-apple before version 1.0.1
attackers can fake their email address during authentication. This
vulnerability impacts applications using the omniauth-apple strategy
of OmniAuth and using the info.email field of OmniAuth's Auth Hash
Schema for any kind of identification. The value of this field may be
set to any value of the attacker's choice including email addresses of
other users. Applications not using info.email for identification but
are instead using the uid field are not impacted in the same manner.
Note, these applications may still be negatively affected if the value
of info.email is being used for other purposes. Applications using
affected versions of omniauth-apple are advised to upgrade to
omniauth-apple version 1.0.1 or later.

Kirby is a CMS. In Kirby CMS (getkirby/cms) before version 3.4.5, and
Kirby Panel before version 2.5.14 , an editor with full access to the
Kirby Panel can upload a PHP .phar file and execute it on the server.
This vulnerability is critical if you might have potential attackers
in your group of authenticated Panel users, as they can gain access to
the server with such a Phar file. Visitors without Panel access
*cannot* use this attack vector. The problem has been patched in Kirby
2.5.14 and Kirby 3.4.5. Please update to one of these or a later
version to fix the vulnerability. Note: Kirby 2 reaches end of life on
December 31, 2020. We therefore recommend to upgrade your Kirby 2
sites to Kirby 3. If you cannot upgrade, we still recommend to update
to Kirby 2.5.14.

Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging and VoIP.
Synapse is a reference "homeserver" implementation of Matrix. A
malicious or poorly-implemented homeserver can inject malformed events
into a room by specifying a different room id in the path of a
`/send_join`, `/send_leave`, `/invite` or
`/exchange_third_party_invite` request. This can lead to a denial of
service in which future events will not be correctly sent to other
servers over federation. This affects any server which accepts
federation requests from untrusted servers. The Matrix Synapse
reference implementation before version 1.23.1 the implementation is
vulnerable to this injection attack. Issue is fixed in version 1.23.1.
As a workaround homeserver administrators could limit access to the
federation API to trusted servers (for example via
`federation_domain_whitelist`).

user is affected who followed the recommendation to setup XStream's
Security Framework with a whitelist! Anyone relying on XStream's
default blacklist can immediately switch to a whilelist for the
allowed types to avoid the vulnerability. Users of XStream 1.4.14 or

Coturn is free open source implementation of TURN and STUN Server.
Coturn before version 4.5.2 by default does not allow peers to connect
and relay packets to loopback addresses in the range of `127.x.x.x`.
However, it was observed that when sending a `CONNECT` request with
the `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` value of `0.0.0.0`, a successful response was
received and subsequently, `CONNECTIONBIND` also received a successful
response. Coturn then is able to relay packets to the loopback
interface. Additionally, when coturn is listening on IPv6, which is
default, the loopback interface can also be reached by making use of
either `[::1]` or `[::]` as the peer address. By using the address
`0.0.0.0` as the peer address, a malicious user will be able to relay
packets to the loopback interface, unless `--denied-peer-ip=0.0.0.0`
(or similar) has been specified. Since the default configuration
implies that loopback peers are not allowed, coturn administrators may
choose to not set the `denied-peer-ip` setting. The issue patched in
version 4.5.2. As a workaround the addresses in the address block
`0.0.0.0/8`, `[::1]` and `[::]` should be denied by default unless
`--allow-loopback-peers` has been specified.

tlslite-ng is an open source python library that implements SSL and
TLS cryptographic protocols. In tlslite-ng before versions 0.7.6 and
0.8.0-alpha39, the code that performs decryption and padding check in
RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is data dependant. In particular, the code
has multiple ways in which it leaks information about the decrypted
ciphertext. It aborts as soon as the plaintext doesn't start with
0x00, 0x02. All TLS servers that enable RSA key exchange as well as
applications that use the RSA decryption API directly are vulnerable.
This is patched in versions 0.7.6 and 0.8.0-alpha39. Note: the patches
depend on Python processing the individual bytes in side-channel free
manner, this is known to not the case (see reference). As such, users
that require side-channel resistance are recommended to use different
TLS implementations, as stated in the security policy of tlslite-ng.

In affected versions of TensorFlow the tf.raw_ops.ImmutableConst
operation returns a constant tensor created from a memory mapped file
which is assumed immutable. However, if the type of the tensor is not
an integral type, the operation crashes the Python interpreter as it
tries to write to the memory area. If the file is too small,
TensorFlow properly returns an error as the memory area has fewer
bytes than what is needed for the tensor it creates. However, as soon
as there are enough bytes, the above snippet causes a segmentation
fault. This is because the allocator used to return the buffer data is
not marked as returning an opaque handle since the needed virtual
method is not overridden. This is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4,
2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.

In TensorFlow release candidate versions 2.4.0rc*, the general
implementation for matching filesystem paths to globbing pattern is
vulnerable to an access out of bounds of the array holding the
directories. There are multiple invariants and preconditions that are
assumed by the parallel implementation of GetMatchingPaths but are not
verified by the PRs introducing it (#40861 and #44310). Thus, we are
completely rewriting the implementation to fully specify and validate
these. This is patched in version 2.4.0. This issue only impacts
master branch and the release candidates for TF version 2.4. The final
release of the 2.4 release will be patched.

In affected versions of TensorFlow under certain cases, loading a
saved model can result in accessing uninitialized memory while
building the computation graph. The MakeEdge function creates an edge
between one output tensor of the src node (given by output_index) and
the input slot of the dst node (given by input_index). This is only
possible if the types of the tensors on both sides coincide, so the
function begins by obtaining the corresponding DataType values and
comparing these for equality. However, there is no check that the
indices point to inside of the arrays they index into. Thus, this can
result in accessing data out of bounds of the corresponding heap
allocated arrays. In most scenarios, this can manifest as unitialized
data access, but if the index points far away from the boundaries of
the arrays this can be used to leak addresses from the library. This
is fixed in versions 1.15.5, 2.0.4, 2.1.3, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, and 2.4.0.

osquery is a SQL powered operating system instrumentation, monitoring,
and analytics framework. In osquery before version 4.6.0, by using
sqlite's ATTACH verb, someone with administrative access to osquery
can cause reads and writes to arbitrary sqlite databases on disk. This
_does_ allow arbitrary files to be created, but they will be sqlite
databases. It does not appear to allow existing non-sqlite files to be
overwritten. This has been patched in osquery 4.6.0. There are several
mitigating factors and possible workarounds. In some deployments, the
people with access to these interfaces may be considered
administrators. In some deployments, configuration is managed by a
central tool. This tool can filter for the `ATTACH` keyword. osquery
can be run as non-root user. Because this also limits the desired
access levels, this requires deployment specific testing and
configuration.

The Jupyter Server provides the backend (i.e. the core services, APIs,
and REST endpoints) for Jupyter web applications like Jupyter
notebook, JupyterLab, and Voila. In Jupyter Server before version
1.1.1, an open redirect vulnerability could cause the jupyter server
to redirect the browser to a different malicious website. All jupyter
servers running without a base_url prefix are technically affected,
however, these maliciously crafted links can only be reasonably made
for known jupyter server hosts. A link to your jupyter server may
*appear* safe, but ultimately redirect to a spoofed server on the
public internet. This same vulnerability was patched in upstream
notebook v5.7.8. This is fixed in jupyter_server 1.1.1. If upgrade is
not available, a workaround can be to run your server on a url prefix:
"jupyter server --ServerApp.base_url=/jupyter/".

DBdeployer is a tool that deploys MySQL database servers easily. In
DBdeployer before version 1.58.2, users unpacking a tarball may use a
maliciously packaged tarball that contains symlinks to files external
to the target. In such scenario, an attacker could induce dbdeployer
to write into a system file, thus altering the computer defenses. For
the attack to succeed, the following factors need to contribute: 1)
The user is logged in as root. While dbdeployer is usable as root, it
was designed to run as unprivileged user. 2) The user has taken a
tarball from a non secure source, without testing the checksum. When
the tarball is retrieved through dbdeployer, the checksum is compared
before attempting to unpack. This has been fixed in version 1.58.2.

which gives it that power. It also set `hostPID: true`, which gave it
the ability to access all other processes on the host, and write
anywhere in the root filesystem of the host. This setting was not
necessary, and is being removed. You are only vulnerable if you have
an additional vulnerability (e.g. a bug in Kubernetes) or
misconfiguration that allows an attacker to run code inside the Weave
Net pod, No such bug is known at the time of release, and there are no
known instances of this being exploited. Weave Net 2.8.0 removes the
hostPID setting and moves CNI plugin install to an init container.
Users who do not update to 2.8.0 can edit the hostPID line in their
existing DaemonSet manifest to say false instead of true, arrange some
other way to install CNI plugins (e.g. Ansible) and remove those
mounts from the DaemonSet manifest.

go-ipfs is an open-source golang implementation of IPFS which is a
global, versioned, peer-to-peer filesystem. In go-ipfs before version
0.8.0-rc1, it is possible for path traversal to occur with DAGs
containing relative paths during retrieval. This can cause files to be
overwritten, or written to incorrect output directories. The issue can
only occur when a get is done on an affected DAG. This is fixed in
version 0.8.0-rc1.

OpenSlides is a free, Web-based presentation and assembly system for
managing and projecting agenda, motions, and elections of assemblies.
OpenSlides version 3.2, due to unsufficient user input validation and
escaping, it is vulnerable to persistant cross-site scripting (XSS).
In the web applications users can enter rich text in various places,
e.g. for personal notes or in motions. These fields can be used to
store arbitrary JavaScript Code that will be executed when other users
read the respective text. An attacker could utilize this vulnerability
be used to manipulate votes of other users, hijack the moderators
session or simply disturb the meeting. The vulnerability was
introduced with 6eae497abeab234418dfbd9d299e831eff86ed45 on
16.04.2020, which is first included in the 3.2 release. It has been
patched in version 3.3 ( in commit
f3809fc8a97ee305d721662a75f788f9e9d21938, merged in master on
20.11.2020).

async-h1 is an asynchronous HTTP/1.1 parser for Rust (crates.io).
There is a request smuggling vulnerability in async-h1 before version
2.3.0. This vulnerability affects any webserver that uses async-h1
behind a reverse proxy, including all such Tide applications. If the
server does not read the body of a request which is longer than some
buffer length, async-h1 will attempt to read a subsequent request from
the body content starting at that offset into the body. One way to
exploit this vulnerability would be for an adversary to craft a
request such that the body contains a request that would not be
noticed by a reverse proxy, allowing it to forge forwarded/x-forwarded
headers. If an application trusted the authenticity of these headers,
it could be misled by the smuggled request. Another potential concern
with this vulnerability is that if a reverse proxy is sending multiple
http clients' requests along the same keep-alive connection, it would
be possible for the smuggled request to specify a long content and
capture another user's request in its body. This content could be
captured in a post request to an endpoint that allows the content to
be subsequently retrieved by the adversary. This has been addressed in
async-h1 2.3.0 and previous versions have been yanked.

HedgeDoc is a collaborative platform for writing and sharing markdown.
In HedgeDoc before version 1.7.1 an attacker can inject arbitrary
`script` tags in HedgeDoc notes using mermaid diagrams. Our content
security policy prevents loading scripts from most locations, but
`www.google-analytics.com` is allowed. Using Google Tag Manger it is
possible to inject arbitrary JavaScript and execute it on page load.
Depending on the configuration of the instance, the attacker may not
need authentication to create or edit notes. The problem is patched in
HedgeDoc 1.7.1. As a workaround one can disallow `www.google-
analytics.com` in the `Content-Security-Policy` header. Note that
other ways to leverage the `script` tag injection might exist.

mdBook is a utility to create modern online books from Markdown files
and is written in Rust. In mdBook before version 0.4.5, there is a
vulnerability affecting the search feature of mdBook, which could
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the page.
The search feature of mdBook (introduced in version 0.1.4) was
affected by a cross site scripting vulnerability that allowed an
attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on an user's browser by
tricking the user into typing a malicious search query, or tricking
the user into clicking a link to the search page with the malicious
search query prefilled. mdBook 0.4.5 fixes the vulnerability by
properly escaping the search query. Owners of websites built with
mdBook have to upgrade to mdBook 0.4.5 or greater and rebuild their
website contents with it.

ftp-srv is an open-source FTP server designed to be simple yet
configurable. In ftp-srv before version 4.4.0 there is a path-
traversal vulnerability. Clients of FTP servers utilizing ftp-srv
hosted on Windows machines can escape the FTP user's defined root
folder using the expected FTP commands, for example, CWD and UPDR.
When windows separators exist within the path (`\`), `path.resolve`
leaves the upper pointers intact and allows the user to move beyond
the root folder defined for that user. We did not take that into
account when creating the path resolve function. The issue is patched
in version 4.4.0 (commit 457b859450a37cba10ff3c431eb4aa67771122e3).
