Apache Dubbo supports various rules to support configuration override
or traffic routing (called routing in Dubbo). These rules are loaded
into the configuration center (eg: Zookeeper, Nacos, ...) and
retrieved by the customers when making a request in order to find the
right endpoint. When parsing these YAML rules, Dubbo customers will
use SnakeYAML library to load the rules which by default will enable
calling arbitrary constructors. An attacker with access to the
configuration center he will be able to poison the rule so when
retrieved by the consumers, it will get RCE on all of them. This was
fixed in Dubbo 2.7.13, 3.0.2

In Apache Dubbo, users may choose to use the Hessian protocol. The
Hessian protocol is implemented on top of HTTP and passes the body of
a POST request directly to a HessianSkeleton: New HessianSkeleton are
created without any configuration of the serialization factory and
therefore without applying the dubbo properties for applying allowed
or blocked type lists. In addition, the generic service is always
exposed and therefore attackers do not need to figure out a valid
service/method name pair. This is fixed in 2.7.13, 2.6.10.1

ALPACA is an application layer protocol content confusion attack,
exploiting TLS servers implementing different protocols but using
compatible certificates, such as multi-domain or wildcard
certificates. A MiTM attacker having access to victim's traffic at the
TCP/IP layer can redirect traffic from one subdomain to another,
resulting in a valid TLS session. This breaks the authentication of
TLS and cross-protocol attacks may be possible where the behavior of
one protocol service may compromise the other at the application
layer.

A flaw has been found in libssh in versions prior to 0.9.6. The SSH
protocol keeps track of two shared secrets during the lifetime of the
session. One of them is called secret_hash and the other session_id.
Initially, both of them are the same, but after key re-exchange,
previous session_id is kept and used as an input to new secret_hash.
Historically, both of these buffers had shared length variable, which
worked as long as these buffers were same. But the key re-exchange
operation can also change the key exchange method, which can be based
on hash of different size, eventually creating "secret_hash" of
different size than the session_id has. This becomes an issue when the
session_id memory is zeroed or when it is used again during second key
re-exchange.

It was found in OpenShift, before version 4.8, that the generated
certificate for the in-cluster Service CA, incorrectly included
additional certificates. The Service CA is automatically mounted into
all pods, allowing them to safely connect to trusted in-cluster
services that present certificates signed by the trusted Service CA.
The incorrect inclusion of additional CAs in this certificate would
allow an attacker that compromises any of the additional CAs to
masquerade as a trusted in-cluster service.

PuTTY through 0.75 proceeds with establishing an SSH session even if
it has never sent a substantive authentication response. This makes it
easier for an attacker-controlled SSH server to present a later
spoofed authentication prompt (that the attacker can use to capture

the client user).

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a
client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but
without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the
server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot
determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the
user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to
allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's
behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication
bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."

An issue was discovered in Dropbear through 2020.81. Due to a non-RFC-
compliant check of the available authentication methods in the client-
side SSH code, it is possible for an SSH server to change the login

measures such as FIDO2 tokens or SSH-Askpass. Thus, it allows an
attacker to abuse a forwarded agent for logging on to another server
unnoticed.

When reading a specially crafted ZIP archive, or a derived formats, an
Apache Ant build can be made to allocate large amounts of memory that
leads to an out of memory error, even for small inputs. This can be
used to disrupt builds using Apache Ant. Commonly used derived formats
from ZIP archives are for instance JAR files and many office files.
Apache Ant prior to 1.9.16 and 1.10.11 were affected.

A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested
virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual
machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a
nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the "int_ctl" field,
this issue could allow a malicious L1 to enable AVIC support (Advanced
Virtual Interrupt Controller) for the L2 guest. As a result, the L2
guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of the host,
resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive data or
potential guest-to-host escape. This flaw affects Linux kernel
versions prior to 5.14-rc7.

A flaw was found in the KVM's AMD code for supporting SVM nested
virtualization. The flaw occurs when processing the VMCB (virtual
machine control block) provided by the L1 guest to spawn/handle a
nested guest (L2). Due to improper validation of the "virt_ext" field,
this issue could allow a malicious L1 to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE
intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. As a
result, the L2 guest would be allowed to read/write physical pages of
the host, resulting in a crash of the entire system, leak of sensitive
data or potential guest-to-host escape.

Reference: MISC:https://checkmk.com/de/werk/13148
Reference: MISC:https://github.com/Edgarloyola/CVE-2021-36563

The CheckMK management web console (versions 1.5.0 to 2.0.0) does not
sanitise user input in various parameters of the WATO module. This
allows an attacker to open a backdoor on the device with HTML content
and interpreted by the browser (such as JavaScript or other client-
side scripts), the XSS payload will be triggered when the user
accesses some specific sections of the application. In the same sense
a very dangerous potential way would be when an attacker who has the
monitor role (not administrator) manages to get a stored XSS to steal
the secretAutomation (for the use of the API in administrator mode)
and thus be able to create another administrator user who has high
privileges on the CheckMK monitoring web console. Another way is that
persistent XSS allows an attacker to modify the displayed content or
change the victim's information. Successful exploitation requires
access to the web management interface, either with valid credentials
or with a hijacked session.

Reference: MLIST:[announce] 20210923 CVE-2021-36749: Apache Druid: The HTTP inputSource allows authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended (incomplete fix of CVE-2021-26920)
Reference: URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r304dfe56a5dfe1b2d9166b24d2c74ad1c6730338b20aef77a00ed2be@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E

In the Druid ingestion system, the InputSource is used for reading
data from a certain data source. However, the HTTP InputSource allows
authenticated users to read data from other sources than intended,
such as the local file system, with the privileges of the Druid server
process. This is not an elevation of privilege when users access Druid
directly, since Druid also provides the Local InputSource, which
allows the same level of access. But it is problematic when users
interact with Druid indirectly through an application that allows
users to specify the HTTP InputSource, but not the Local InputSource.
In this case, users could bypass the application-level restriction by
passing a file URL to the HTTP InputSource. This issue was previously
mentioned as being fixed in 0.21.0 as per CVE-2021-26920 but was not
fixed in 0.21.0 or 0.21.1.

A flaw was found in postgresql. A purpose-crafted query can read
arbitrary bytes of server memory. In the default configuration, any
authenticated database user can complete this attack at will. The
attack does not require the ability to create objects. If server
settings include max_worker_processes=0, the known versions of this
attack are infeasible. However, undiscovered variants of the attack
may be independent of that setting.

Encode.pm, as distributed in Perl through 5.34.0, allows local users
to gain privileges via a Trojan horse Encode::ConfigLocal library (in
the current working directory) that preempts dynamic module loading.
Exploitation requires an unusual configuration, and certain 2021
versions of Encode.pm (3.05 through 3.11). This issue occurs because
the || operator evaluates @INC in a scalar context, and thus @INC has
only an integer value.

A flaw was found in Ansible Galaxy Collections. When collections are
built manually, any files in the repository directory that are not
explicitly excluded via the ``build_ignore`` list in "galaxy.yml"
include files in the ``.tar.gz`` file. This contains sensitive info,
such as the user's Ansible Galaxy API key and any secrets in
``ansible`` or ``ansible-playbook`` verbose output without
the``no_log`` redaction. Currently, there is no way to deprecate a
Collection Or delete a Collection Version. Once published, anyone who
downloads or installs the collection can view the secrets.

<p>An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists because of overly
permissive Access Control Lists (ACLs) on multiple system files,
including the Security Accounts Manager (SAM) database. An attacker
who successfully exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code
with SYSTEM privileges. An attacker could then install programs; view,
change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user
rights.</p> <p>An attacker must have the ability to execute code on a
victim system to exploit this vulnerability.</p> <p>After installing
this security update, you <em>must</em> manually delete all shadow
copies of system files, including the SAM database, to fully mitigate
this vulnerabilty. <strong>Simply installing this security update will
not fully mitigate this vulnerability.</strong> See <a href="https://s

A crafted 16-bit grayscale PNG image may lead to a out-of-bounds write
in the heap area. An attacker may take advantage of that to cause heap
data corruption or eventually arbitrary code execution and circumvent
secure boot protections. This issue has a high complexity to be
exploited as an attacker needs to perform some triage over the heap
layout to achieve signifcant results, also the values written into the
memory are repeated three times in a row making difficult to produce
valid payloads. This flaw affects grub2 versions prior grub-2.12.

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to
call the API function EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application
will call this function twice. The first time, on entry, the "out"
parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the "outlen" parameter is
populated with the buffer size required to hold the decrypted
plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufficiently sized
buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-
NULL value for the "out" parameter. A bug in the implementation of the
SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of the buffer size
required to hold the plaintext returned by the first call to
EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can be smaller than the actual size required by the
second call. This can lead to a buffer overflow when
EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a
buffer that is too small. A malicious attacker who is able present SM2
content for decryption to an application could cause attacker chosen
data to overflow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering
the contents of other data held after the buffer, possibly changing
application behaviour or causing the application to crash. The
location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap
allocated. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k).

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an
ASN1_STRING structure which contains a buffer holding the string data
and a field holding the buffer length. This contrasts with normal C
strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is
terminated with a NUL (0) byte. Although not a strict requirement,
ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL's own "d2i" functions (and
other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has
been set with the ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL
terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING structure. However, it is
possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING
structures which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly
setting the "data" and "length" fields in the ASN1_STRING array. This
can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous
OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that
the ASN1_STRING byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is
not guaranteed for strings that have been directly constructed. Where
an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where
that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly
constructed by the application without NUL terminating the "data"
field, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can also
occur during name constraints processing of certificates (for example
if a certificate has been directly constructed by the application
instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and the
certificate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures). It
can also occur in the X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and
X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor can cause an
application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it
through one of the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be
hit. This might result in a crash (causing a Denial of Service
attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory
contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2za
(Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).

The Snappy frame decoder function doesn't restrict the chunk length
which may lead to excessive memory usage. Beside this it also may
buffer reserved skippable chunks until the whole chunk was received
which may lead to excessive memory usage as well. This vulnerability
can be triggered by supplying malicious input that decompresses to a
very big size (via a network stream or a file) or by sending a huge
skippable chunk.

Reference: MISC:https://www.gov.il/en/departments/faq/cve_advisories

CyberArk Identity 21.5.131, when handling an invalid authentication
attempt, sometimes reveals whether the username is valid. In certain
authentication policy configurations with MFA, the API response length
can be used to differentiate between a valid user and an invalid one
(aka Username Enumeration). Response differentiation enables attackers
to enumerate usernames of valid application users. Attackers can use
this information to leverage brute-force and dictionary attacks in
order to discover valid account information such as passwords.

Umbraco Forms version 4.0.0 up to and including 8.7.5 and below are
vulnerable to a security flaw that could lead to a remote code
execution attack and/or arbitrary file deletion. A vulnerability
occurs because validation of the file extension is performed after the
file has been stored in a temporary directory. By default, files are
stored within the application directory structure at
%BASEDIR%/APP_DATA/TEMP/FileUploads/. Whilst access to this directory
is restricted by the root web.config file, it is possible to override
this restriction by uploading another specially crafted web.config
file to the temporary directory. It is possible to exploit this flaw
to upload a malicious script file to execute arbitrary code and system
commands on the server.

In DCE/RPC it is possible to share the handles (cookies for resource
state) between multiple connections via a mechanism called
'association groups'. These handles can reference connections to our
sam.ldb database. However while the database was correctly shared, the
user credentials state was only pointed at, and when one connection
within that association group ended, the database would be left
pointing at an invalid 'struct session_info'. The most likely outcome
here is a crash, but it is possible that the use-after-free could
instead allow different user state to be pointed at and this might
allow more privileged access.

Southsoft GMIS 5.0 is vulnerable to CSRF attacks. Attackers can access
other users' private information such as photos through CSRF. For
example: any student's photo information can be accessed through
/gmis/(S([1]))/student/grgl/PotoImageShow/?bh=[2]. Among them, the
code in [1] is a random string generated according to the user's login
related information. It can protect the user's identity, but it can
not effectively prevent unauthorized access. The code in [2] is the
student number of any student. The attacker can carry out CSRF attack
on the system by modifying [2] without modifying [1].

A DMA reentrancy issue was found in the USB EHCI controller emulation
of QEMU. EHCI does not verify if the Buffer Pointer overlaps with its
MMIO region when it transfers the USB packets. Crafted content may be
written to the controller's registers and trigger undesirable actions
(such as reset) while the device is still transferring packets. This
can ultimately lead to a use-after-free issue. A malicious guest could
use this flaw to crash the QEMU process on the host, resulting in a
denial of service condition, or potentially execute arbitrary code
within the context of the QEMU process on the host. This flaw affects
QEMU versions before 7.0.0.

non-administrative authenticated attacker to craft a malicious XSL
stylesheet file containing a script with OS-level commands, copy it
into a location to be accessed by the system and then create a file
which will trigger the XSLT engine to execute the script contained
within the malicious XSL file. This can result in a full compromise of

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/12/03/1

Prior to Apache Commons Net 3.9.0, Net's FTP client trusts the host
from PASV response by default. A malicious server can redirect the
Commons Net code to use a different host, but the user has to connect
to the malicious server in the first place. This may lead to leakage
of information about services running on the private network of the
client. The default in version 3.9.0 is now false to ignore such
hosts, as cURL does. See

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20210728 [SECURITY] CVE-2021-37578 Apache jUDDI Remote code execution
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/07/29/1

Apache jUDDI uses several classes related to Java's Remote Method
Invocation (RMI) which (as an extension to UDDI) provides an alternate
transport for accessing UDDI services. RMI uses the default Java
serialization mechanism to pass parameters in RMI invocations. A
remote attacker can send a malicious serialized object to the above
RMI entries. The objects get deserialized without any check on the
incoming data. In the worst case, it may let the attacker run
arbitrary code remotely. For both jUDDI web service applications and
jUDDI clients, the usage of RMI is disabled by default. Since this is
an optional feature and an extension to the UDDI protocol, the
likelihood of impact is low. Starting with 3.3.10, all RMI related
code was removed.

The Dubbo Provider will check the incoming request and the
corresponding serialization type of this request meet the
configuration set by the server. But there's an exception that the
attacker can use to skip the security check (when enabled) and
reaching a deserialization operation with native java serialization.
Apache Dubbo 2.7.13, 3.0.2 fixed this issue by quickly fail when any
unrecognized request was found.

In version 6.5 of Microchip MiWi software and all previous versions
including legacy products, there is a possibility of frame counters
being validated/updated prior to the message authentication. With this
vulnerability in place, an attacker may increment the incoming frame
counter values by injecting messages with a sufficiently large frame
counter value and invalid payload. This results in denial of
service/valid packets in the network. There is also a possibility of a
replay attack in the stack.

Any CA issuer in the RPKI can trick OctoRPKI prior to 1.3.0 into
emitting an invalid VRP "MaxLength" value, causing RTR sessions to
terminate. An attacker can use this to disable RPKI Origin Validation
in a victim network (for example AS 13335 - Cloudflare) prior to
launching a BGP hijack which during normal operations would be
rejected as "RPKI invalid". Additionally, in certain deployments RTR
session flapping in and of itself also could cause BGP routing churn,
causing availability issues.

The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from
Nextcloud Server with a computer. The Nextcloud Desktop Client invokes
its uninstaller script when being installed to make sure there are no
remnants of previous installations. In versions 3.0.3 through 3.2.4,
the Client searches the `Uninstall.exe` file in a folder that can be
written by regular users. This could lead to a case where a malicious
user creates a malicious `Uninstall.exe`, which would be executed with
administrative privileges on the Nextcloud Desktop Client
installation. This issue is fixed in Nextcloud Desktop Client version
3.3.0. As a workaround, do not allow untrusted users to create content
in the `C:\` system folder and verify that there is no malicious
`C:\Uninstall.exe` file on the system.

Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds
read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.4 and earlier. The out-of-
bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a
crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they
can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note
that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a
less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For
example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you
need to add an extra command-line argument such as insert. The bug is
fixed in version v0.27.5.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/25/6

FreeSWITCH is a Software Defined Telecom Stack enabling the digital
transformation from proprietary telecom switches to a software
implementation that runs on any commodity hardware. Prior to version
1.10.7, FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP MESSAGE requests, leading
to spam and message spoofing. By default, SIP requests of the type
MESSAGE (RFC 3428) are not authenticated in the affected versions of
FreeSWITCH. MESSAGE requests are relayed to SIP user agents registered
with the FreeSWITCH server without requiring any authentication.
Although this behaviour can be changed by setting the `auth-messages`
parameter to `true`, it is not the default setting. Abuse of this
security issue allows attackers to send SIP MESSAGE messages to any
SIP user agent that is registered with the server without requiring
authentication. Additionally, since no authentication is required,
chat messages can be spoofed to appear to come from trusted entities.
Therefore, abuse can lead to spam and enable social engineering,
phishing and similar attacks. This issue is patched in version 1.10.7.
Maintainers recommend that this SIP message type is authenticated by
default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do not need to be explicitly
set the `auth-messages` parameter. When following such a
recommendation, a new parameter can be introduced to explicitly
disable authentication.

Skytable is an open source NoSQL database. In versions prior to 0.6.4
an incorrect check of return value of the accept function in the run-
loop for a TCP socket/TLS socket/TCP+TLS multi-socket causes an early
exit from the run loop that should continue infinitely unless
terminated by a local user, effectively causing the whole database
server to shut down. This has severe impact and can be used to easily
cause DoS attacks without the need to use much bandwidth. The attack
vectors include using an incomplete TLS connection for example by not
providing the certificate for the connection and using a specially
crafted TCP packet that triggers the application layer backoff
algorithm.

SuperMartijn642's Config Lib is a library used by a number of mods for
the game Minecraft. The versions of SuperMartijn642's Config Lib
between 1.0.4 and 1.0.8 are affected by a vulnerability and can be
exploited on both servers and clients. Using SuperMartijn642's Config
Lib, servers will send a packet to clients with the server's config
values. In order to read `enum` values from the packet data,
`ObjectInputStream#readObject` is used. `ObjectInputStream#readObject`
will instantiate a class based on the input data. Since, the packet
data is not validated before `ObjectInputStream#readObject` is called,
an attacker can instantiate any class by sending a malicious packet.
If a suitable class is found, the vulnerability can lead to a number
of exploits, including remote code execution. Although the vulnerable
packet is typically only send from server to client, it can
theoretically also be send from client to server. This means both
clients and servers running SuperMartijn642's Config Lib between 1.0.4
and 1.0.8 are vulnerable. The vulnerability has been patched in
SuperMartijn642's Config lib 1.0.9. Both, players and server owners,
should update to 1.0.9 or higher.

Leafkit is a templating language with Swift-inspired syntax. Versions
prior to 1.3.0 are susceptible to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
This affects anyone passing unsanitised data to Leaf's variable tags.
Before this fix, Leaf would not escape any strings passed to tags as
variables. If an attacker managed to find a variable that was rendered
with their unsanitised data, they could inject scripts into a
generated Leaf page, which could enable XSS attacks if other
mitigations such as a Content Security Policy were not enabled. This
has been patched in 1.3.0. As a workaround sanitize any untrusted
input before passing it to Leaf and enable a CSP to block inline
script and CSS data.

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
When restoring tensors via raw APIs, if the tensor name is not
provided, TensorFlow can be tricked into dereferencing a null pointer.
Alternatively, attackers can read memory outside the bounds of heap
allocated data by providing some tensor names but not enough for a
successful restoration. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensor
flow/tensorflow/blob/47a06f40411a69c99f381495f490536972152ac0/tensorfl
ow/core/kernels/save_restore_tensor.cc#L158-L159) retrieves the tensor
list corresponding to the `tensor_name` user controlled input and
immediately retrieves the tensor at the restoration index (controlled
via `preferred_shard` argument). This occurs without validating that
the provided list has enough values. If the list is empty this results
in dereferencing a null pointer (undefined behavior). If, however, the
list has some elements, if the restoration index is outside the bounds
this results in heap OOB read. We have patched the issue in GitHub
commit 9e82dce6e6bd1f36a57e08fa85af213e2b2f2622. The fix will be

that the input arguments are valid. This validation would have caught
the illegal state represented by the reproducer above. However, the
validation uses `OP_REQUIRES` which translates to setting the `Status`
object of the current `OpKernelContext` to an error status, followed
by an empty `return` statement which just terminates the execution of
the function it is present in. However, this does not mean that the
kernel execution is finalized: instead, execution continues from the

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
In affected versions the implementation for
`tf.raw_ops.ExperimentalDatasetToTFRecord` and
`tf.raw_ops.DatasetToTFRecord` can trigger heap buffer overflow and
segmentation fault. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow

that all records in the dataset are of string type. However, there is
no check for that, and the example given above uses numeric types. We
have patched the issue in GitHub commit
e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876. The fix will be included in
TensorFlow 2.6.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow

`tf.raw_ops.BoostedTreesCreateEnsemble` can result in a use after free
error if an attacker supplies specially crafted arguments. The [implem

4b51578f8181d3aaab77a1ddeb/tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/resou
rce_ops.cc#L55) uses a reference counted resource and decrements the
refcount if the initialization fails, as it should. However, when the
code was written, the resource was represented as a naked pointer but
later refactoring has changed it to be a smart pointer. Thus, when the
pointer leaves the scope, a subsequent `free`-ing of the resource
occurs, but this fails to take into account that the refcount has
already reached 0, thus the resource has been already freed. During
this double-free process, members of the resource object are accessed
for cleanup but they are invalid as the entire resource has been
freed. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit

In affected versions an attacker can trigger a crash via a
`CHECK`-fail in debug builds of TensorFlow using
`tf.raw_ops.ResourceGather` or a read from outside the bounds of heap

supplies is less than the rank of the input tensor. Since the
implementation uses several for loops over the dimensions of `tensor`,
this results in reading data from outside the bounds of heap allocated

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
In affected versions due to incomplete validation in MKL
implementation of requantization, an attacker can trigger undefined
behavior via binding a reference to a null pointer or can access data
outside the bounds of heap allocated arrays. The [implementation](http

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
In affected versions it is possible to nest a `tf.map_fn` within
another `tf.map_fn` call. However, if the input tensor is a
`RaggedTensor` and there is no function signature provided, code
assumes the output is a fully specified tensor and fills output buffer
with uninitialized contents from the heap. The `t` and `z` outputs
should be identical, however this is not the case. The last row of `t`
contains data from the heap which can be used to leak other memory
information. The bug lies in the conversion from a `Variant` tensor to
a `RaggedTensor`. The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/t

that all inner shapes match and this results in the additional
dimensions. The same implementation can result in data loss, if input
tensor is tweaked. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
In affected versions all TFLite operations that use quantization can
be made to use unitialized values. [For example](https://github.com/te

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
In affected versions the strided slice implementation in TFLite has a
logic bug which can allow an attacker to trigger an infinite loop.
This arises from newly introduced support for [ellipsis in axis defini
tion](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/149562d49faa709ea8
0df1d99fc41d005b81082a/tensorflow/lite/kernels/strided_slice.cc#L103-L
122). An attacker can craft a model such that `ellipsis_end_idx` is
smaller than `i` (e.g., always negative). In this case, the inner loop
does not increase `i` and the `continue` statement causes execution to
skip over the preincrement at the end of the outer loop. We have
patched the issue in GitHub commit
dfa22b348b70bb89d6d6ec0ff53973bacb4f4695. TensorFlow 2.6.0 is the only

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
In affected versions when running shape functions, some functions
(such as `MutableHashTableShape`) produce extra output information in
the form of a `ShapeAndType` struct. The shapes embedded in this
struct are owned by an inference context that is cleaned up almost
immediately; if the upstream code attempts to access this shape
information, it can trigger a segfault. `ShapeRefiner` is mitigating
this for normal output shapes by cloning them (and thus putting the
newly created shape under ownership of an inference context that will
not die), but we were not doing the same for shapes and types. This
commit fixes that by doing similar logic on output shapes and types.

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
In affected versions under certain conditions, Go code can trigger a
segfault in string deallocation. For string tensors,
`C.TF_TString_Dealloc` is called during garbage collection within a
finalizer function. However, tensor structure isn't checked until
encoding to avoid a performance penalty. The current method for
dealloc assumes that encoding succeeded, but segfaults when a string
tensor is garbage collected whose encoding failed (e.g., due to
mismatched dimensions). To fix this, the call to set the finalizer
function is deferred until `NewTensor` returns and, if encoding failed
for a string tensor, deallocs are determined based on bytes written.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00023.html

The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.16, 5.0.8,
and 6.1.7 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code
execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file
whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.
This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are
not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls
to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached
when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when
extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink
with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory
names in the archive entry used backslashes as a path separator on
posix systems. The cache checking logic used both `\` and `/`
characters as path separators, however `\` is a valid filename
character on posix systems. By first creating a directory, and then
replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to
bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an
untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and
subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus
allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite. Additionally, a
similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive filesystems. If a
tar archive contained a directory at `FOO`, followed by a symbolic
link named `foo`, then on case-insensitive file systems, the creation
of the symbolic link would remove the directory from the filesystem,
but _not_ from the internal directory cache, as it would not be
treated as a cache hit. A subsequent file entry within the `FOO`
directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic link,
thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues
were addressed in releases 4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of
node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these
issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to
a more recent version of node-tar. If this is not possible, a
workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-9r2w-394v-53qc.

and 8.0.7 the `phpinfo()` can be exposed if the `/vendor` is not
protected from public access. This is a rare situation today since the
vendor directory is often located outside the web directory or
protected via server rule (.htaccess, etc). Only the v6, v7 and v8
will be patched respectively in 8.0.7, 7.1.2, 6.1.5. Older versions
such as v5, v4 are not longer supported and will **NOT** be patched.
As a workaround, protect the `/vendor` directory from public access.

OneFuzz is an open source self-hosted Fuzzing-As-A-Service platform.
Starting with OneFuzz 2.12.0 or greater, an incomplete authorization
check allows an authenticated user from any Azure Active Directory
tenant to make authorized API calls to a vulnerable OneFuzz instance.
To be vulnerable, a OneFuzz deployment must be both version 2.12.0 or
greater and deployed with the non-default --multi_tenant_domain
option. This can result in read/write access to private data such as
software vulnerability and crash information, security testing tools
and proprietary code and symbols. Via authorized API calls, this also
enables tampering with existing data and unauthorized code execution
on Azure compute resources. This issue is resolved starting in release
2.31.0, via the addition of application-level check of the bearer
token's `issuer` against an administrator-configured allowlist. As a
workaround users can restrict access to the tenant of a deployed
OneFuzz instance < 2.31.0 by redeploying in the default configuration,
which omits the `--multi_tenant_domain` option.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2022/12/msg00023.html

The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10,
and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code
execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file
whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.
This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are
not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary stat calls
to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached
when directories are created. This logic was insufficient when
extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink
with names containing unicode values that normalized to the same
value. Additionally, on Windows systems, long path portions would
resolve to the same file system entities as their 8.3 "short path"
counterparts. A specially crafted tar archive could thus include a
directory with one form of the path, followed by a symbolic link with
a different string that resolves to the same file system entity,
followed by a file using the first form. By first creating a
directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink that had a
different apparent name that resolved to the same entry in the
filesystem, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on
directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink
into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files
into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and
overwrite. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and
6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not
receive patches for these issues. If you are still using a v3 release
we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar. If this
is not possible, a workaround is available in the referenced GHSA-
qq89-hq3f-393p.

The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10,
and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary file creation/overwrite and arbitrary code
execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any file
whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is
not extracted. This is, in part, accomplished by sanitizing absolute
paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that
contain `..` path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against
the extraction target directory. This logic was insufficient on
Windows systems when extracting tar files that contained a path that
was not an absolute path, but specified a drive letter different from
the extraction target, such as `C:some\path`. If the drive letter does
not match the extraction target, for example `D:\extraction\dir`, then
the result of `path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath)` would
resolve against the current working directory on the `C:` drive,
rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a `..`
portion of the path could occur immediately after the drive letter,
such as `C:../foo`, and was not properly sanitized by the logic that
checked for `..` within the normalized and split portions of the path.
This only affects users of `node-tar` on Windows systems. These issues
were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and 6.1.9. The v3 branch of
node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these
issues. If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to
a more recent version of node-tar. There is no reasonable way to work
around this issue without performing the same path normalization
procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to
the latest patched versions of node-tar, rather than attempt to
sanitize paths themselves.

jsoup is a Java library for working with HTML. Those using jsoup
versions prior to 1.14.2 to parse untrusted HTML or XML may be
vulnerable to DOS attacks. If the parser is run on user supplied
input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser to get
stuck (loop indefinitely until cancelled), to complete more slowly
than usual, or to throw an unexpected exception. This effect may
support a denial of service attack. The issue is patched in version
1.14.2. There are a few available workarounds. Users may rate limit
input parsing, limit the size of inputs based on system resources,
and/or implement thread watchdogs to cap and timeout parse runtimes.

An internal reference count is held on the buffer pool, incremented
every time a new buffer is created from the pool. The reference count
is maintained as an int; on LP64 systems this can cause the reference
count to overflow if the client creates a large number of wl_shm
buffer objects, or if it can coerce the server to create a large
number of external references to the buffer storage. With the
reference count overflowing, a use-after-free can be constructed on
the wl_shm_pool tracking structure, where values may be incremented or
decremented; it may also be possible to construct a limited oracle to
leak 4 bytes of server-side memory to the attacking client at a time.

The Canon TR150 print driver through 3.71.2.10 is vulnerable to a
privilege escalation issue. During the add printer process, a local
attacker can overwrite CNMurGE.dll and, if timed properly, the
overwritten DLL will be loaded into a SYSTEM process resulting in
escalation of privileges. This occurs because the driver drops a
world-writable DLL into a CanonBJ %PROGRAMDATA% location that gets
loaded by printisolationhost (a system process).

Some components in Apache Kafka use `Arrays.equals` to validate a
password or key, which is vulnerable to timing attacks that make brute
force attacks for such credentials more likely to be successful. Users
should upgrade to 2.8.1 or higher, or 3.0.0 or higher where this
vulnerability has been fixed. The affected versions include Apache
Kafka 2.0.0, 2.0.1, 2.1.0, 2.1.1, 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.3.0, 2.3.1,

Reference: MISC:https://protocolpolice.nl/CVE-2021-38154_Protocol_Police_Catwalk_Alert
Reference: MISC:https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/product-advisories

Certain Canon devices manufactured in 2012 through 2020 (such as
imageRUNNER ADVANCE iR-ADV C5250), when Catwalk Server is enabled for
HTTP access, allow remote attackers to modify an e-mail address
setting, and thus cause the device to send sensitive information
through e-mail to the attacker. For example, an incoming FAX may be
sent through e-mail to the attacker. This occurs when a PIN is not
required for General User Mode, as exploited in the wild in August
2021.

document. If a CouchDB admin opens that attachment in a browser, e.g.
via the CouchDB admin interface Fauxton, any JavaScript code embedded
in that HTML attachment will be executed within the security context
of that admin. A similar route is available with the already

Rapid7 InsightVM suffers from insufficient session expiration when an
administrator performs a security relevant edit on an existing, logged
on user. For example, if a user's password is changed by an
administrator due to an otherwise unrelated credential leak, that user
account's current session is still valid after the password change,
potentially allowing the attacker who originally compromised the
credential to remain logged in and able to cause further damage. This
vulnerability is mitigated by the use of the Platform Login feature.
This issue is related to CVE-2019-5638.

Microsoft introduced a new feature in Windows 10 known as Cloud
Clipboard which, if enabled, will record data copied to the clipboard
to the cloud, and make it available on other computers in certain
scenarios. Applications that wish to prevent copied data from being
recorded in Cloud History must use specific clipboard formats; and
Firefox before versions 94 and ESR 91.3 did not implement them. This
could have caused sensitive data to be recorded to a user's Microsoft
account. *This bug only affects Firefox for Windows 10+ with Cloud
Clipboard enabled. Other operating systems are unaffected.*. This
vulnerability affects Firefox < 94, Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox
ESR < 91.3.

The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 (RFC 8164) allows a
connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the
visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin
with unencrypted connections on port 80. However, if a second
encrypted port on the same IP address (e.g. port 8443) did not opt-in
to opportunistic encryption; a network attacker could forward a
connection from the browser to port 443 to port 8443, causing the
browser to treat the content of port 8443 as same-origin with HTTP.
This was resolved by disabling the Opportunistic Encryption feature,
which had low usage. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 94,
Thunderbird < 91.3, and Firefox ESR < 91.3.

TP-Link UE330 USB splitter devices through 2021-08-09, in certain
specific use cases in which the device supplies power to audio-output
equipment, allow remote attackers to recover speech signals from an
LED on the device, via a telescope and an electro-optical sensor, aka
a "Glowworm" attack. We assume that the USB splitter supplies power to
some speakers. The power indicator LED of the USB splitter is
connected directly to the power line, as a result, the intensity of

A flaw was found in the way the dumpable flag setting was handled when
certain SUID binaries executed its descendants. The prerequisite is a
SUID binary that sets real UID equal to effective UID, and real GID
equal to effective GID. The descendant will then have a dumpable value
set to 1. As a result, if the descendant process crashes and
core_pattern is set to a relative value, its core dump is stored in
the current directory with uid:gid permissions. An unprivileged local
user with eligible root SUID binary could use this flaw to place core
dumps into root-owned directories, potentially resulting in escalation
of privileges.

Reference: URL:https://ledgersmb.org/cve-2021-3882-sensitive-non-secure-cookie

LedgerSMB does not set the 'Secure' attribute on the session
authorization cookie when the client uses HTTPS and the LedgerSMB
server is behind a reverse proxy. By tricking a user to use an
unencrypted connection (HTTP), an attacker may be able to obtain the
authentication data by capturing network traffic. LedgerSMB 1.8 and
newer switched from Basic authentication to using cookie
authentication with encrypted cookies. Although an attacker can't
access the information inside the cookie, nor the password of the
user, possession of the cookie is enough to access the application as
the user from which the cookie has been obtained. In order for the
attacker to obtain the cookie, first of all the server must be
configured to respond to unencrypted requests, the attacker must be
suitably positioned to eavesdrop on the network traffic between the
client and the server *and* the user must be tricked into using
unencrypted HTTP traffic. Proper audit control and separation of
duties limit Integrity impact of the attack vector. Users of LedgerSMB
1.8 are urged to upgrade to known-fixed versions. Users of LedgerSMB
1.7 or 1.9 are unaffected by this vulnerability and don't need to take
action. As a workaround, users may configure their Apache or Nginx
reverse proxy to add the Secure attribute at the network boundary
instead of relying on LedgerSMB. For Apache, please refer to the
'Header always edit' configuration command in the mod_headers module.
For Nginx, please refer to the 'proxy_cookie_flags' configuration
command.
