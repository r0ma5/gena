The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial
rule set bypass by submitting a specially crafted HTTP Content-Type
header field that indicates multiple character encoding schemes. A
vulnerable back-end can potentially be exploited by declaring multiple
Content-Type "charset" names and therefore bypassing the configurable
CRS Content-Type header "charset" allow list. An encoded payload can
bypass CRS detection this way and may then be decoded by the backend.
The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the
currently supported versions 3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users
are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3 respectively.

The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a partial
rule set bypass for HTTP multipart requests by submitting a payload
that uses a character encoding scheme via the Content-Type or the
deprecated Content-Transfer-Encoding multipart MIME header fields that
will not be decoded and inspected by the web application firewall
engine and the rule set. The multipart payload will therefore bypass
detection. A vulnerable backend that supports these encoding schemes
can potentially be exploited. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x
are affected, as well as the currently supported versions 3.2.1 and
3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised upgrade to 3.2.2 and 3.3.3
respectively. The mitigation against these vulnerabilities depends on
the installation of the latest ModSecurity version (v2.9.6 / v3.0.8).

The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response
body bypass. A client can issue an HTTP Accept header field containing
an optional "charset" parameter in order to receive the response in an
encoded form. Depending on the "charset", this response can not be
decoded by the web application firewall. A restricted resource, access
to which would ordinarily be detected, may therefore bypass detection.
The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00033.html

The OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS) is affected by a response
body bypass to sequentially exfiltrate small and undetectable sections
of data by repeatedly submitting an HTTP Range header field with a
small byte range. A restricted resource, access to which would
ordinarily be detected, may be exfiltrated from the backend, despite
being protected by a web application firewall that uses CRS. Short
subsections of a restricted resource may bypass pattern matching
techniques and allow undetected access. The legacy CRS versions 3.0.x
and 3.1.x are affected, as well as the currently supported versions
3.2.1 and 3.3.2. Integrators and users are advised to upgrade to 3.2.2
and 3.3.3 respectively and to configure a CRS paranoia level of 3 or
higher.

Reference: MISC:https://www.panini.com/en/news-events/panini-patents-revolutionary-new-%E2%80%9Ceverest%E2%80%9D-architecture

Panini Everest Engine 2.0.4 allows unprivileged users to create a file
named Everest.exe in the %PROGRAMDATA%\Panini folder. This leads to
privilege escalation because a service, running as SYSTEM, uses the
unquoted path of %PROGRAMDATA%\Panini\Everest Engine\EverestEngine.exe
and therefore a Trojan horse %PROGRAMDATA%\Panini\Everest.exe may be
executed instead of the intended vendor-supplied EverestEngine.exe
file.

If an X.509 certificate contains a malformed policy constraint and
policy processing is enabled, then a write lock will be taken twice
recursively. On some operating systems (most widely: Windows) this
results in a denial of service when the affected process hangs. Policy
processing being enabled on a publicly facing server is not considered
to be a common setup. Policy processing is enabled by passing the
`-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function. Update (31 March 2023):
The description of the policy processing enablement was corrected
based on CVE-2023-0466.

The SVG Support plugin for WordPress defaults to insecure settings in
version 2.5 and 2.5.1. SVG files containing malicious javascript are
not sanitized. While version 2.5 adds the ability to sanitize image as
they are uploaded, the plugin defaults to disable sanitization and
does not restrict SVG upload to only administrators. This allows
authenticated attackers, with author-level privileges and higher, to
upload malicious SVG files that can be embedded in posts and pages by
higher privileged users. Additionally, the embedded JavaScript is also
triggered on visiting the image URL, which allows an attacker to
execute malicious code in browsers visiting that URL.

The 3DPrint WordPress plugin before 3.5.6.9 does not protect against
CSRF attacks in the modified version of Tiny File Manager included
with the plugin, allowing an attacker to craft a malicious request
that will create an archive of any files or directories on the target
server by tricking a logged in admin into submitting a form.
Furthermore the created archive has a predictable location and name,
allowing the attacker to download the file if they know the time at
which the form was submitted, making it possible to leak sensitive

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from
ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode -
an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and
completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in SMM
additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against
modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware
backdoor/implant into BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in BIOS
could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges from
ring 0 to ring -2, execute arbitrary code in System Management Mode -
an environment more privileged than operating system (OS) and
completely isolated from it. Running arbitrary code in SMM
additionally bypasses SMM-based SPI flash protections against
modifications, which can help an attacker to install a firmware
backdoor/implant into BIOS. Such a malicious firmware code in BIOS
could persist across operating system re-installs. Additionally, this
vulnerability potentially could be used by malicious actors to bypass
security mechanisms provided by UEFI firmware (for example, Secure
Boot and some types of memory isolation for hypervisors). This issue
affects: Module name: OverClockSmiHandler SHA256:

A potential attacker can execute an arbitrary code at the time of the
PEI phase and influence the subsequent boot stages. This can lead to
the mitigations bypassing, physical memory contents disclosure,
discovery of any secrets from any Virtual Machines (VMs) and bypassing
memory isolation and confidential computing boundaries. Additionally,
an attacker can build a payload which can be injected into the SMRAM
memory. This issue affects: Module name: S3Resume2Pei SHA256:

The Diffie-Hellman Key Agreement Protocol allows use of long exponents
that arguably make certain calculations unnecessarily expensive,
because the 1996 van Oorschot and Wiener paper found that
"(appropriately) short exponents" can be used when there are adequate
subgroup constraints, and these short exponents can lead to less
expensive calculations than for long exponents. This issue is
different from CVE-2002-20001 because it is based on an observation
about exponent size, rather than an observation about numbers that are
not public keys. The specific situations in which calculation expense
would constitute a server-side vulnerability depend on the protocol
(e.g., TLS, SSH, or IKE) and the DHE implementation details. In
general, there might be an availability concern because of server-side
resource consumption from DHE modular-exponentiation calculations.
Finally, it is possible for an attacker to exploit this vulnerability
and CVE-2002-20001 together.

SQL injection attacks can result in unauthorized access to sensitive
data, such as passwords, credit card details, or personal user
information. Many high-profile data breaches in recent years have been
the result of SQL injection attacks, leading to reputational damage
and regulatory fines. In some cases, an attacker can obtain a
persistent backdoor into an organization's systems, leading to a long-
term compromise that can go unnoticed for an extended period. This
affect 16.0.1 and 16.0.2 only. 16.0.0 or lower, and 16.0.3 or higher

Reference: URL:https://www.netskope.com/company/security-compliance-and-assurance/security-advisories-and-disclosures/netskope-security-advisory-nskpsa-2023-002

The Netskope client service (prior to R96) on Windows runs as NT
AUTHORITY\SYSTEM which writes log files to a writable directory
(C:\Users\Public\netSkope) for a standard user. The files are created
and written with a SYSTEM account except one file (logplaceholder)
which inherits permission giving all users full access control list.
Netskope client restricts access to this file by allowing only read
permissions as a standard user. Whenever the Netskope client service
restarts, it deletes the logplaceholder and recreates, creating a race
condition, which can be exploited by a malicious local user to create
the file and set ACL permissions on the file. Once the file is created
by a malicious user with proper ACL permissions, all files within
C:\Users\Public\netSkope\ becomes modifiable by the unprivileged user.
By using Windows pseudo-symlink, these files can be pointed to other
places in the system and thus malicious users will be able to elevate
privileges.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/28/1

Once an user is authenticated on Jolokia, he can potentially trigger
arbitrary code execution. In details, in ActiveMQ configurations,
jetty allows org.jolokia.http.AgentServlet to handler request to
/api/jolokia org.jolokia.http.HttpRequestHandler#handlePostRequest is
able to create JmxRequest through JSONObject. And calls to
org.jolokia.http.HttpRequestHandler#executeRequest. Into deeper
calling stacks, org.jolokia.handler.ExecHandler#doHandleRequest is
able to invoke through refection. And then, RCE is able to be achieved
via jdk.management.jfr.FlightRecorderMXBeanImpl which exists on Java
version above 11. 1 Call newRecording. 2 Call setConfiguration. And a
webshell data hides in it. 3 Call startRecording. 4 Call copyTo
method. The webshell will be written to a .jsp file. The mitigation is
to restrict (by default) the actions authorized on Jolokia, or disable
Jolokia. A more restrictive Jolokia configuration has been defined in
default ActiveMQ distribution. We encourage users to upgrade to
ActiveMQ distributions version including updated Jolokia
configuration: 5.16.6, 5.17.4, 5.18.0, 6.0.0.

Programs which compile regular expressions from untrusted sources may
be vulnerable to memory exhaustion or denial of service. The parsed
regexp representation is linear in the size of the input, but in some
cases the constant factor can be as high as 40,000, making relatively
small regexps consume much larger amounts of memory. After fix, each
regexp being parsed is limited to a 256 MB memory footprint. Regular
expressions whose representation would use more space than that are
rejected. Normal use of regular expressions is unaffected.

Due to unsanitized NUL values, attackers may be able to maliciously
set environment variables on Windows. In syscall.StartProcess and
os/exec.Cmd, invalid environment variable values containing NUL values
are not properly checked for. A malicious environment variable value
can exploit this behavior to set a value for a different environment
variable. For example, the environment variable string "A=B\x00C=D"
sets the variables "A=B" and "C=D".

An attacker can cause excessive memory growth in a Go server accepting
HTTP/2 requests. HTTP/2 server connections contain a cache of HTTP
header keys sent by the client. While the total number of entries in
this cache is capped, an attacker sending very large keys can cause
the server to allocate approximately 64 MiB per open connection.

On Windows, restricted files can be accessed via os.DirFS and
http.Dir. The os.DirFS function and http.Dir type provide access to a
tree of files rooted at a given directory. These functions permit
access to Windows device files under that root. For example,
os.DirFS("C:/tmp").Open("COM1") opens the COM1 device. Both os.DirFS
and http.Dir only provide read-only filesystem access. In addition, on
Windows, an os.DirFS for the directory (the root of the current drive)
can permit a maliciously crafted path to escape from the drive and
access any path on the system. With fix applied, the behavior of
os.DirFS("") has changed. Previously, an empty root was treated
equivalently to "/", so os.DirFS("").Open("tmp") would open the path
"/tmp". This now returns an error.

A request smuggling attack is possible when using MaxBytesHandler.
When using MaxBytesHandler, the body of an HTTP request is not fully
consumed. When the server attempts to read HTTP2 frames from the

which could be attacker-manipulated to represent arbitrary HTTP2
requests.

A denial of service is possible from excessive resource consumption in
net/http and mime/multipart. Multipart form parsing with
mime/multipart.Reader.ReadForm can consume largely unlimited amounts
of memory and disk files. This also affects form parsing in the
net/http package with the Request methods FormFile, FormValue,
ParseMultipartForm, and PostFormValue. ReadForm takes a maxMemory
parameter, and is documented as storing "up to maxMemory bytes +10MB
(reserved for non-file parts) in memory". File parts which cannot be
stored in memory are stored on disk in temporary files. The
unconfigurable 10MB reserved for non-file parts is excessively large
and can potentially open a denial of service vector on its own.
However, ReadForm did not properly account for all memory consumed by
a parsed form, such as map entry overhead, part names, and MIME
headers, permitting a maliciously crafted form to consume well over
10MB. In addition, ReadForm contained no limit on the number of disk
files created, permitting a relatively small request body to create a
large number of disk temporary files. With fix, ReadForm now properly
accounts for various forms of memory overhead, and should now stay
within its documented limit of 10MB + maxMemory bytes of memory
consumption. Users should still be aware that this limit is high and
may still be hazardous. In addition, ReadForm now creates at most one
on-disk temporary file, combining multiple form parts into a single
temporary file. The mime/multipart.File interface type's documentation
states, "If stored on disk, the File's underlying concrete type will
be an *os.File.". This is no longer the case when a form contains more
than one file part, due to this coalescing of parts into a single
file. The previous behavior of using distinct files for each form part
may be reenabled with the environment variable
GODEBUG=multipartfiles=distinct. Users should be aware that
multipart.ReadForm and the http.Request methods that call it do not
limit the amount of disk consumed by temporary files. Callers can
limit the size of form data with http.MaxBytesReader.

to Denial of Service attacks (DOS). If the parser is running on user
supplied input, an attacker may supply content that causes the parser
to crash by stack overflow. This effect may support a denial of
service attack.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
Next-Generation IoT devices. Versions prior to 4.9 are vulnerable to
an Out-of-bounds read. While processing the L2CAP protocol, the
Bluetooth Low Energy stack of Contiki-NG needs to map an incoming
channel ID to its metadata structure. While looking up the
corresponding channel structure in get_channel_for_cid (in
os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c), a bounds check is performed on the
incoming channel ID, which is meant to ensure that the channel ID does
not exceed the maximum number of supported channels.However, an
integer truncation issue leads to only the lowest byte of the channel
ID to be checked, which leads to an incomplete out-of-bounds check. A
crafted channel ID leads to out-of-bounds memory to be read and
written with attacker-controlled data. The vulnerability has been
patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and will be included in
release 4.9. As a workaround, Users can apply the patch in Contiki-NG
pull request 2081 on GitHub.

Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop
platforms. In versions prior to 1.0.7 and 1.1.2, Tauri is vulnerable
to an Incorrectly-Resolved Name. Due to incorrect escaping of special
characters in paths selected via the file dialog and drag and drop
functionality, it is possible to partially bypass the `fs` scope
definition. It is not possible to traverse into arbitrary paths, as
the issue is limited to neighboring files and sub folders of already
allowed paths. The impact differs on Windows, MacOS and Linux due to
different specifications of valid path characters. This bypass depends
on the file picker dialog or dragged files, as user selected paths are
automatically added to the allow list at runtime. A successful bypass
requires the user to select a pre-existing malicious file or directory
during the file picker dialog and an adversary controlled logic to
access these files. The issue has been patched in versions 1.0.7,
1.1.2 and 1.2.0. As a workaround, disable the dialog and
fileDropEnabled component inside the tauri.conf.json.

The Nextcloud Desktop Client is a tool to synchronize files from
Nextcloud Server with your computer. In version 3.6.0, if a user
received a malicious file share and has it synced locally or the
virtual filesystem enabled and clicked a nc://open/ link it will open
the default editor for the file type of the shared file, which on
Windows can also sometimes mean that a file depending on the type,
e.g. "vbs", is being executed. It is recommended that the Nextcloud
Desktop client is upgraded to version 3.6.1. As a workaround, users
can block the Nextcloud Desktop client 3.6.0 by setting the
`minimum.supported.desktop.version` system config to `3.6.1` on the
server, so new files designed to use this attack vector are not
downloaded anymore. Already existing files can still be used. Another
workaround would be to enforce shares to be accepted by setting the
`sharing.force_share_accept` system config to `true` on the server, so
new files designed to use this attack vector are not downloaded
anymore. Already existing shares can still be abused.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning.
`tf.keras.losses.poisson` receives a `y_pred` and `y_true` that are
passed through `functor::mul` in `BinaryOp`. If the resulting
dimensions overflow an `int32`, TensorFlow will crash due to a size
mismatch during broadcast assignment. We have patched the issue in

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The
reference kernel of the `CONV_3D_TRANSPOSE` TensorFlow Lite operator
wrongly increments the data_ptr when adding the bias to the result.
Instead of `data_ptr += num_channels;` it should be `data_ptr +=
output_num_channels;` as if the number of input channels is different
than the number of output channels, the wrong result will be returned
and a buffer overflow will occur if num_channels >
output_num_channels. An attacker can craft a model with a specific
number of input channels. It is then possible to write specific values
through the bias of the layer outside the bounds of the buffer. This
attack only works if the reference kernel resolver is used in the
interpreter. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
72c0bdcb25305b0b36842d746cc61d72658d2941. The fix will be included in

Git is distributed revision control system. `git log` can display
commits in an arbitrary format using its `--format` specifiers. This
functionality is also exposed to `git archive` via the `export-subst`
gitattribute. When processing the padding operators, there is a
integer overflow in `pretty.c::format_and_pad_commit()` where a
`size_t` is stored improperly as an `int`, and then added as an offset
to a `memcpy()`. This overflow can be triggered directly by a user
running a command which invokes the commit formatting machinery (e.g.,
`git log --format=...`). It may also be triggered indirectly through
git archive via the export-subst mechanism, which expands format
specifiers inside of files within the repository during a git archive.
This integer overflow can result in arbitrary heap writes, which may
result in arbitrary code execution. The problem has been patched in
the versions published on 2023-01-17, going back to v2.30.7. Users are
advised to upgrade. Users who are unable to upgrade should disable
`git archive` in untrusted repositories. If you expose git archive via
`git daemon`, disable it by running `git config --global
daemon.uploadArch false`.

Element iOS is an iOS Matrix client provided by Element. It is based
on MatrixSDK. Prior to version 1.9.7, events encrypted using Megolm
for which trust could not be established did not get decorated
accordingly (with warning shields). Therefore a malicious homeserver
could inject messages into the room without the user being alerted
that the messages were not sent by a verified group member, even if
the user has previously verified all group members. This issue has
been patched in Element iOS 1.9.7. There are currently no known
workarounds.

Discourse-calendar is a plugin for the Discourse messaging platform
which adds the ability to create a dynamic calendar in the first post
of a topic. Members of private groups or public groups with private
members can be listed by users, who can create and edit post events.
This vulnerability only affects sites which have discourse post events
enabled. This issue has been patched in commit `ca5ae3e7e` which will
be included in future releases. Users unable to upgrade should disable
the `discourse_post_event_enabled` setting to fully mitigate the
issue. Also, it's possible to prevent regular users from using this
vulnerability by removing all groups from the
`discourse_post_event_allowed_on_groups` but note that moderators will
still be able to use it.

Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. For organizations
with System for Cross-domain Identity Management(SCIM) account
management enabled, Zulip Server 5.0 through 5.6 checked the SCIM
bearer token using a comparator that did not run in constant time.
Therefore, it might theoretically be possible for an attacker to infer
the value of the token by performing a sophisticated timing analysis
on a large number of failing requests. If successful, this would allow
the attacker to impersonate the SCIM client for its abilities to read
and update user accounts in the Zulip organization. Organizations
where SCIM account management has not been enabled are not affected.

Content-Type&#8217;s essence as "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
"multipart/form-data", or "text/plain", could potentially be used to
invoke routes that only accepts `application/json` content type, thus
bypassing any CORS protection, and therefore they could lead to a
Cross-Site Request Forgery attack. This issue has been patched in

Grails Spring Security Core plugin is vulnerable to privilege
escalation. The vulnerability allows an attacker access to one
endpoint (i.e. the targeted endpoint) using the authorization
requirements of a different endpoint (i.e. the donor endpoint). In
some Grails framework applications, access to the targeted endpoint
will be granted based on meeting the authorization requirements of the
donor endpoint, which can result in a privilege escalation attack.
This vulnerability has been patched in grails-spring-security-core
versions 3.3.2, 4.0.5 and 5.1.1. Impacted Applications: Grails Spring
Security Core plugin versions: 1.x 2.x >=3.0.0 <3.3.2 >=4.0.0 <4.0.5
>=5.0.0 <5.1.1 We strongly suggest that all Grails framework
applications using the Grails Spring Security Core plugin be updated
to a patched release of the plugin. Workarounds: Users should create a
subclass extending one of the following classes from the
`grails.plugin.springsecurity.web.access.intercept` package, depending
on their security configuration: *
`AnnotationFilterInvocationDefinition` *
`InterceptUrlMapFilterInvocationDefinition` *
`RequestmapFilterInvocationDefinition` In each case, the subclass
should override the `calculateUri` method like so: ``` @Override
protected String calculateUri(HttpServletRequest request) {
UrlPathHelper.defaultInstance.getRequestUri(request) } ``` This should
be considered a temporary measure, as the patched versions of grails-
spring-security-core deprecates the `calculateUri` method. Once
upgraded to a patched version of the plugin, this workaround is no
longer needed. The workaround is especially important for version 2.x,
as no patch is available version 2.x of the GSSC plugin.

A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale Windows client allows a
malicious website to reconfigure the Tailscale daemon `tailscaled`,
which can then be used to remotely execute code. In the Tailscale
Windows client, the local API was bound to a local TCP socket, and
communicated with the Windows client GUI in cleartext with no Host
header verification. This allowed an attacker-controlled website
visited by the node to rebind DNS to an attacker-controlled DNS
server, and then make local API requests in the client, including
changing the coordination server to an attacker-controlled
coordination server. An attacker-controlled coordination server can
send malicious URL responses to the client, including pushing
executables or installing an SMB share. These allow the attacker to
remotely execute code on the node. All Windows clients prior to
version v.1.32.3 are affected. If you are running Tailscale on
Windows, upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.

A vulnerability identified in the Tailscale client allows a malicious
website to access the peer API, which can then be used to access
Tailscale environment variables. In the Tailscale client, the peer API
was vulnerable to DNS rebinding. This allowed an attacker-controlled
website visited by the node to rebind DNS for the peer API to an
attacker-controlled DNS server, and then making peer API requests in
the client, including accessing the node&#8217;s Tailscale environment
variables. An attacker with access to the peer API on a node could use
that access to read the node&#8217;s environment variables, including any
credentials or secrets stored in environment variables. This may
include Tailscale authentication keys, which could then be used to add
new nodes to the user&#8217;s tailnet. The peer API access could also be
used to learn of other nodes in the tailnet or send files via
Taildrop. All Tailscale clients prior to version v1.32.3 are affected.
Upgrade to v1.32.3 or later to remediate the issue.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. When the `reset a forgotten
password` feature of XWiki was used, the password was then stored in
plain text in database. This only concerns XWiki 13.1RC1 and newer
versions. Note that it only concerns the reset password feature
available from the "Forgot your password" link in the login view: the
features allowing a user to change their password, or for an admin to
change a user password are not impacted. This vulnerability is
particularly dangerous in combination with other vulnerabilities
allowing to perform data leak of personal data from users, such as
GHSA-599v-w48h-rjrm. Note that this vulnerability only concerns the
users of the main wiki: in case of farms, the users registered on
subwiki are not impacted thanks to a bug we discovered when
investigating this. The problem has been patched in version 14.6RC1,
14.4.3 and 13.10.8. The patch involves a migration of the impacted
users as well as the history of the page, to ensure no password
remains in plain text in the database. This migration also involves to
inform the users about the possible disclosure of their passwords: by
default, two emails are automatically sent to the impacted users. A
first email to inform about the possibility that their password have
been leaked, and a second email using the reset password feature to
ask them to set a new password. It's also possible for administrators
to set some properties for the migration: it's possible to decide if
the user password should be reset (default) or if the passwords should
be kept but only hashed. Note that in the first option, the users
won't be able to login anymore until they set a new password if they
were impacted. Note that in both options, mails will be sent to users
to inform them and encourage them to change their passwords.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services

in XWiki 14.6RC1, 13.10.8 and 14.4.3. The patch (commit `2fc20891`)
for the document `Menu.MenuMacro` can be manually applied or a XAR

basically unchanged since XWiki 11.6 so on XWiki 11.6 or later the
patch for version of 13.10.8 (commit `59ccca24a`) can most likely be
applied, on XWiki version 14.0 and later the versions in XWiki 14.6

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. The `modifications` rest endpoint
does not filter out entries according to the user's rights. Therefore,
information hidden from unauthorized users are exposed though the
`modifications` rest endpoint (comments and page names etc). Users
should upgrade to XWiki 14.6+, 14.4.3+, or 13.10.8+. Older versions
have not been patched. There are no known workarounds.

Flarum is an open source discussion platform. Flarum's page title
system allowed for page titles to be converted into HTML DOM nodes
when pages were rendered. The change was made after `v1.5` and was not
noticed. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious HTML markup
using a discussion title input, either by creating a new discussion or
renaming one. The XSS attack occurs after a visitor opens the relevant
discussion page. All communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0` to
`v1.6.1` are impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed and published
as flarum/core `v1.6.2`. All communities running Flarum from `v1.5.0`
to `v1.6.1` have to upgrade as soon as possible to v1.6.2. There are
no known workarounds for this issue.

pgjdbc is an open source postgresql JDBC Driver. In affected versions
a prepared statement using either `PreparedStatement.setText(int,
InputStream)` or `PreparedStatemet.setBytea(int, InputStream)` will
create a temporary file if the InputStream is larger than 2k. This
will create a temporary file which is readable by other users on Unix
like systems, but not MacOS. On Unix like systems, the system's
temporary directory is shared between all users on that system.
Because of this, when files and directories are written into this
directory they are, by default, readable by other users on that same
system. This vulnerability does not allow other users to overwrite the
contents of these directories or files. This is purely an information
disclosure vulnerability. Because certain JDK file system APIs were
only added in JDK 1.7, this this fix is dependent upon the version of
the JDK you are using. Java 1.7 and higher users: this vulnerability
is fixed in 4.5.0. Java 1.6 and lower users: no patch is available. If
you are unable to patch, or are stuck running on Java 1.6, specifying
the java.io.tmpdir system environment variable to a directory that is
exclusively owned by the executing user will mitigate this
vulnerability.

DHIS 2 is an open source information system for data capture,
management, validation, analytics and visualization. Affected versions
are subject to a privilege escalation vulnerability. A DHIS2 user with
authority to manage users can assign superuser privileges to themself
by manually crafting an HTTP PUT request. Only users with the
following DHIS2 user role authorities can exploit this vulnerability.
Note that in many systems the only users with user admin privileges
are also superusers. In these cases, the escalation vulnerability does
not exist. The vulnerability is only exploitable by attackers who can
authenticate as users with the user admin authority. As this is
usually a small and relatively trusted set of users, exploit vectors
will often be limited. DHIS2 administrators should upgrade to the
following hotfix releases: 2.36.12.1, 2.37.8.1, 2.38.2.1, 2.39.0.1.
The only known workaround to this issue is to avoid the assignment of
the user management authority to any users until the patch has been
applied.

properly limiting connection time. Connections will only be terminated
after `max_spider_size` (default: 10M) bytes have been downloaded,
which can in some cases lead to long-lived connections towards the
streaming media server (for instance, Icecast). This can cause
excessive traffic and connections toward such servers if their stream
URL is, for example, posted to a large room with many Synapse
instances with URL preview enabled. Version 1.52.0 implements a
timeout mechanism which will terminate URL preview connections after
30 seconds. Since generating URL previews for media streams is not
supported and always fails, 1.53.0 additionally implements an allow
list for content types for which Synapse will even attempt to generate
a URL preview. Upgrade to 1.53.0 to fully resolve the issue. As a
workaround, turn off URL preview functionality by setting

Git GUI is a convenient graphical tool that comes with Git for
Windows. Its target audience is users who are uncomfortable with using
Git on the command-line. Git GUI has a function to clone repositories.
Immediately after the local clone is available, Git GUI will
automatically post-process it, among other things running a spell
checker called `aspell.exe` if it was found. Git GUI is implemented as
a Tcl/Tk script. Due to the unfortunate design of Tcl on Windows, the
search path when looking for an executable _always includes the
current directory_. Therefore, malicious repositories can ship with an
`aspell.exe` in their top-level directory which is executed by Git GUI
without giving the user a chance to inspect it first, i.e. running
untrusted code. This issue has been addressed in version 2.39.1. Users
are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid using Git
GUI for cloning. If that is not a viable option, at least avoid
cloning from untrusted sources.

MPXJ is an open source library to read and write project plans from a
variety of file formats and databases. On Unix-like operating systems
(not Windows or macos), MPXJ's use of `File.createTempFile(..)`
results in temporary files being created with the permissions `-rw-r--
r--`. This means that any other user on the system can read the
contents of this file. When MPXJ is reading a schedule file which
requires the creation of a temporary file or directory, a
knowledgeable local user could locate these transient files while they
are in use and would then be able to read the schedule being processed
by MPXJ. The problem has been patched, MPXJ version 10.14.1 and later
includes the necessary changes. Users unable to upgrade may set
`java.io.tmpdir` to a directory to which only the user running the
application has access will prevent other users from accessing these
temporary files.

Autolab is a course management service, initially developed by a team
of students at Carnegie Mellon University, that enables instructors to
offer autograded programming assignments to their students over the
Web. A file disclosure vulnerability was discovered in Autolab's
remote handin feature, whereby users are able to hand-in assignments
using paths outside their submission directory. Users can then view
the submission to view the file's contents. The vulnerability has been
patched in version 2.10.0. As a workaround, ensure that the field for
the remote handin feature is empty (Edit Assessment > Advanced >
Remote handin path), and that you are not running Autolab as `root`
(or any user that has write access to `/`). Alternatively, disable the
remote handin feature if it is unneeded by replacing the body of
`local_submit` in `app/controllers/assessment/handin.rb` with
`render(plain: "Feature disabled", status: :bad_request) && return`.

Muhammara is a node module with c/cpp bindings to modify PDF with
JavaScript for node or electron. The package muhammara before 2.6.2
and from 3.0.0 and before 3.3.0, as well as all versions of
muhammara's predecessor package hummus, are vulnerable to Denial of
Service (DoS) when supplied with a maliciously crafted PDF file to be
parsed. The issue has been patched in muhammara version 3.4.0 and the
fix has been backported to version 2.6.2. As a workaround, do not
process files from untrusted sources. If using hummus, replace the
package with muhammara.

BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions
prior to 2.4.3, are subject to Insufficient Verification of Data
Authenticity, resulting in Denial of Service. An attacker can make a
Meteor call to `validateAuthToken` using a victim's userId, meetingId,
and an invalid authToken. This forces the victim to leave the
conference, because the resulting verification failure is also
observed and handled by the victim's client. The attacker must be a
participant in any meeting on the server. This issue is patched in
version 2.4.3. There are no workarounds.

BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. Versions
prior to 2.4-rc-6 are subject to Ineffective user bans. The attacker
could register multiple users, and join the meeting with one of them.
When that user is banned, they could still join the meeting with the
remaining registered users from the same extId. This issue has been
fixed by improving permissions such that banning a user removes all
users related to their extId, including registered users that have not
joined the meeting. This issue is patched in versions 2.4-rc-6 and
2.5-alpha-1. There are no workarounds.

XStream serializes Java objects to XML and back again. Versions prior
to 1.4.20 may allow a remote attacker to terminate the application
with a stack overflow error, resulting in a denial of service only via
manipulation the processed input stream. The attack uses the hash code
implementation for collections and maps to force recursive hash
calculation causing a stack overflow. This issue is patched in version
1.4.20 which handles the stack overflow and raises an
InputManipulationException instead. A potential workaround for users
who only use HashMap or HashSet and whose XML refers these only as
default map or set, is to change the default implementation of
java.util.Map and java.util per the code example in the referenced
advisory. However, this implies that your application does not care
about the implementation of the map and all elements are comparable.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
Next-Generation IoT devices. Versions prior to 4.9 contain a NULL
Pointer Dereference in BLE L2CAP module. The Contiki-NG operating
system for IoT devices contains a Bluetooth Low Energy stack. An
attacker can inject a packet in this stack, which causes the
implementation to dereference a NULL pointer and triggers undefined
behavior. More specifically, while processing the L2CAP protocol, the
implementation maps an incoming channel ID to its metadata structure.
In this structure, state information regarding credits is managed
through calls to the function input_l2cap_credit in the module
os/net/mac/ble/ble-l2cap.c. Unfortunately, the input_l2cap_credit
function does not check that the metadata corresponding to the user-
supplied channel ID actually exists, which can lead to the channel
variable being set to NULL before a pointer dereferencing operation is
performed. The vulnerability has been patched in the "develop" branch
of Contiki-NG, and will be included in release 4.9. Users can apply
the patch in Contiki-NG pull request #2253 as a workaround until the
new package is released.

Reference: URL:https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt

A read buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate
verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this
occurs after certificate chain signature verification and requires
either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the
application to continue certificate verification despite failure to
construct a path to a trusted issuer. The read buffer overrun might
result in a crash which could lead to a denial of service attack. In
theory it could also result in the disclosure of private memory
contents (such as private keys, or sensitive plaintext) although we
are not aware of any working exploit leading to memory contents
disclosure as of the time of release of this advisory. In a TLS
client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In
a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client
authentication and a malicious client connects.

The Image Hover Effects Ultimate plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
Stored Cross-Site Scripting via several values that can be added to an
Image Hover in versions 9.8.1 to 9.8.4 due to insufficient input
sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that
will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. By default,
the plugin only allows administrators access to edit Image Hovers,
however, if a site admin makes the plugin's features available to
lower privileged users through the 'Who Can Edit?' setting then this

The pgAdmin server includes an HTTP API that is intended to be used to
validate the path a user selects to external PostgreSQL utilities such
as pg_dump and pg_restore. The utility is executed by the server to
determine what PostgreSQL version it is from. Versions of pgAdmin
prior to 6.17 failed to properly secure this API, which could allow an
unauthenticated user to call it with a path of their choosing, such as
a UNC path to a server they control on a Windows machine. This would
cause an appropriately named executable in the target path to be
executed by the pgAdmin server.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/6

Xenstore: Guests can cause Xenstore to not free temporary memory When
working on a request of a guest, xenstored might need to allocate
quite large amounts of memory temporarily. This memory is freed only
after the request has been finished completely. A request is regarded
to be finished only after the guest has read the response message of
the request from the ring page. Thus a guest not reading the response
can cause xenstored to not free the temporary memory. This can result
in memory shortages causing Denial of Service (DoS) of xenstored.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/7

Xenstore: Guests can get access to Xenstore nodes of deleted domains
Access rights of Xenstore nodes are per domid. When a domain is gone,
there might be Xenstore nodes left with access rights containing the
domid of the removed domain. This is normally no problem, as those
access right entries will be corrected when such a node is written
later. There is a small time window when a new domain is created,
where the access rights of a past domain with the same domid as the
new one will be regarded to be still valid, leading to the new domain
being able to get access to a node which was meant to be accessible by
the removed domain. For this to happen another domain needs to write
the node before the newly created domain is being introduced to
Xenstore by dom0.

Oxenstored 32->31 bit integer truncation issues Integers in Ocaml are
63 or 31 bits of signed precision. The Ocaml Xenbus library takes a C
uint32_t out of the ring and casts it directly to an Ocaml integer. In
64-bit Ocaml builds this is fine, but in 32-bit builds, it truncates
off the most significant bit, and then creates unsigned/signed
confusion in the remainder. This in turn can feed a negative value
into logic not expecting a negative value, resulting in unexpected
exceptions being thrown. The unexpected exception is not handled
suitably, creating a busy-loop trying (and failing) to take the bad
packet out of the xenstore ring.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/01/3

x86: unintended memory sharing between guests On Intel systems that
support the "virtualize APIC accesses" feature, a guest can read and
write the global shared xAPIC page by moving the local APIC out of
xAPIC mode. Access to this shared page bypasses the expected isolation
that should exist between two guests.

x86 shadow plus log-dirty mode use-after-free In environments where
host assisted address translation is necessary but Hardware Assisted
Paging (HAP) is unavailable, Xen will run guests in so called shadow
mode. Shadow mode maintains a pool of memory used for both shadow page
tables as well as auxiliary data structures. To migrate or snapshot
guests, Xen additionally runs them in so called log-dirty mode. The
data structures needed by the log-dirty tracking are part of
aformentioned auxiliary data. In order to keep error handling efforts
within reasonable bounds, for operations which may require memory
allocations shadow mode logic ensures up front that enough memory is
available for the worst case requirements. Unfortunately, while page
table memory is properly accounted for on the code path requiring the
potential establishing of new shadows, demands by the log-dirty
infrastructure were not taken into consideration. As a result, just
established shadow page tables could be freed again immediately, while
other code is still accessing them on the assumption that they would
remain allocated.

Mishandling of guest SSBD selection on AMD hardware The current logic
to set SSBD on AMD Family 17h and Hygon Family 18h processors requires
that the setting of SSBD is coordinated at a core level, as the
setting is shared between threads. Logic was introduced to keep track
of how many threads require SSBD active in order to coordinate it,
such logic relies on using a per-core counter of threads that have
SSBD active. When running on the mentioned hardware, it's possible for
a guest to under or overflow the thread counter, because each write to
VIRT_SPEC_CTRL.SSBD by the guest gets propagated to the helper that
does the per-core active accounting. Underflowing the counter causes
the value to get saturated, and thus attempts for guests running on
the same core to set SSBD won't have effect because the hypervisor
assumes it's already active.
