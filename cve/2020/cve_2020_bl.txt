A vulnerability was found in libX11. The security flaw occurs because
the functions in src/InitExt.c in libX11 do not check that the values
provided for the Request, Event, or Error IDs are within the bounds of
the arrays that those functions write to, using those IDs as array
indexes. They trust that they were called with values provided by an
Xserver adhering to the bounds specified in the X11 protocol, as all X
servers provided by X.Org do. As the protocol only specifies a single
byte for these values, an out-of-bounds value provided by a malicious
server (or a malicious proxy-in-the-middle) can only overwrite other
portions of the Display structure and not write outside the bounds of
the Display structure itself, possibly causing the client to crash
with this memory corruption.

Elasticsearch generally filters out sensitive information and
credentials before logging to the audit log. It was found that this
filtering was not applied when requests to Elasticsearch use certain
deprecated URIs for APIs. The impact of this flaw is that sensitive
information such as passwords and tokens might be printed in cleartext
in Elasticsearch audit logs. Note that audit logging is disabled by
default and needs to be explicitly enabled and even when audit logging
is enabled, request bodies that could contain sensitive information
are not printed to the audit log unless explicitly configured.

It was discovered that when acting as TLS clients, Beats, Elastic
Agent, APM Server, and Fleet Server did not verify whether the server
certificate is valid for the target IP address; however, certificate
signature validation is still performed. More specifically, when the
client is configured to connect to an IP address (instead of a
hostname) it does not validate the server certificate's IP SAN values
against that IP address and certificate validation fails, and
therefore the connection is not blocked as expected.

only Kibana version 8.10.0 when logging in the JSON layout or when the
pattern layout is configured to log the %meta pattern. Elastic has
released Kibana 8.10.1 which resolves this issue. The error object
recorded in the log contains request information, which can include
sensitive data, such as authentication credentials, cookies,
authorization headers, query params, request paths, and other
metadata. Some examples of sensitive data which can be included in the
logs are account credentials for kibana_system, kibana-metricbeat, or
Kibana end-users.

In Lightbend Akka before 2.8.1, the async-dns resolver (used by
Discovery in DNS mode and transitively by Cluster Bootstrap) uses
predictable DNS transaction IDs when resolving DNS records, making DNS
resolution subject to poisoning by an attacker. If the application
performing discovery does not validate (e.g., via TLS) the
authenticity of the discovered service, this may result in
exfiltration of application data (e.g., persistence events may be
published to an unintended Kafka broker). If such validation is
performed, then the poisoning constitutes a denial of access to the
intended service. This affects Akka 2.5.14 through 2.8.0, and Akka
Discovery through 2.8.0.

Sage X3 version 12.14.0.50-0 is vulnerable to Cross Site Scripting
(XSS). Some parts of the Web application are dynamically built using
user's inputs. Yet, those inputs are not verified nor filtered by the
application, so they mathed the expected format. Therefore, when
HTML/JavaScript code is injected into those fields, this code will be
saved by the application and executed by the web browser of the user
viewing the web page. Several injection points have been identified on
the application. The major one requires the user to be authenticated
with a common account, he can then target an Administrator. All others
endpoints need the malicious user to be authenticated as an
Administrator. Therefore, the impact is diminished.

All versions of @fastify/oauth2 used a statically generated state
parameter at startup time and were used across all requests for all
users. The purpose of the Oauth2 state parameter is to prevent Cross-
Site-Request-Forgery attacks. As such, it should be unique per user
and should be connected to the user's session in some way that will
allow the server to validate it. v7.2.0 changes the default behavior
to store the state in a cookie with the http-only and same-site=lax
attributes set. The state is now by default generated for every user.
Note that this contains a breaking change in the checkStateFunction
function, which now accepts the full Request object.

`fs.mkdtemp()` and `fs.mkdtempSync()` can be used to bypass the
permission model check using a path traversal attack. This flaw arises
from a missing check in the fs.mkdtemp() API and the impact is a
malicious actor could create an arbitrary directory. This
vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission
model in Node.js 20. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued,

A vulnerability has been identified in Node.js version 20, affecting
users of the experimental permission model when the --allow-fs-read
flag is used with a non-* argument. This flaw arises from an
inadequate permission model that fails to restrict file stats through
the `fs.statfs` API. As a result, malicious actors can retrieve stats
from files that they do not have explicit read access to. This
vulnerability affects all users using the experimental permission
model in Node.js 20. Please note that at the time this CVE was issued,
the permission model is an experimental feature of Node.js.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20230502 CVE-2023-32007: Apache Spark: Shell command injection via Spark UI
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/05/02/1

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** The Apache Spark UI offers the
possibility to enable ACLs via the configuration option
spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter, this checks whether
a user has access permissions to view or modify the application. If
ACLs are enabled, a code path in HttpSecurityFilter can allow someone
to perform impersonation by providing an arbitrary user name. A
malicious user might then be able to reach a permission check function
that will ultimately build a Unix shell command based on their input,
and execute it. This will result in arbitrary shell command execution
as the user Spark is currently running as. This issue was disclosed
earlier as CVE-2022-33891, but incorrectly claimed version 3.1.3
(which has since gone EOL) would not be affected. NOTE: This
vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by
the maintainer. Users are recommended to upgrade to a supported
version of Apache Spark, such as version 3.4.0.

Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual
machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, due to missing overflow check for
loop variables, by assigning the iterator of a loop to a variable, it
is possible to overflow the type of the latter. The issue seems to
happen only in loops of type `for i in range(a, a + N)` as in loops of
type `for i in range(start, stop)` and `for i in range(stop)`, the
compiler is able to raise a `TypeMismatch` when trying to overflow the
variable. The problem has been patched in version 0.3.8.

Vyper is a Pythonic smart contract language for the Ethereum virtual
machine. Prior to version 0.3.8, internal calls with default arguments
are compiled incorrectly. Depending on the number of arguments
provided in the call, the defaults are added not right-to-left, but
left-to-right. If the types are incompatible, typechecking is
bypassed. The ability to pass kwargs to internal functions is an
undocumented feature that is not well known about. The issue is
patched in version 0.3.8.

Time Tracker is an open source time tracking system. The week view
plugin in Time Tracker versions 1.22.11.5782 and prior was not
escaping titles for notes in week view table. Because of that, it was
possible for a logged in user to enter notes with elements of

subsequent requests to week view. This issue is fixed in version
1.22.12.5783. As a workaround, use `htmlspecialchars` when calling
`$field->setTitle` on line #245 in the `week.php` file, as happens in
version 1.22.12.5783.

c-ares is an asynchronous resolver library. c-ares is vulnerable to
denial of service. If a target resolver sends a query, the attacker
forges a malformed UDP packet with a length of 0 and returns them to
the target resolver. The target resolver erroneously interprets the 0
length as a graceful shutdown of the connection. This issue has been

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services

possible to exploit well known parameters in XWiki URLs to perform
redirection to untrusted site. This vulnerability was partially fixed
in the past for XWiki 12.10.7 and 13.3RC1 but there is still the
possibility to force specific URLs to skip some checks, e.g. using
URLs like `http:example.com` in the parameter would allow the
redirect. The issue has now been patched against all patterns that are
known for performing redirects. This issue has been patched in XWiki
14.10.4 and 15.0. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

in-toto is a framework to protect supply chain integrity. The in-toto
configuration is read from various directories and allows users to
configure the behavior of the framework. The files are from
directories following the XDG base directory specification. In
versions 1.4.0 and prior, among the files read is `.in_totorc` which
is a hidden file in the directory in which in-toto is run. If an
attacker controls the inputs to a supply chain step, they can mask
their activities by also passing in an `.in_totorc` file that includes
the necessary exclude patterns and settings. RC files are widely used
in other systems and security issues have been discovered in their
implementations as well. Maintainers found in their conversations with
in-toto adopters that `in_totorc` is not their preferred way to
configure in-toto. As none of the options supported in `in_totorc` is
unique, and can be set elsewhere using API parameters or CLI
arguments, the maintainers decided to drop support for `in_totorc`.
in-toto's `user_settings` module has been dropped altogether in commit
3a21d84f40811b7d191fa7bd17265c1f99599afd. Users may also sandbox
functionary code as a security measure.

Netmaker makes networks with WireGuard. Prior to versions 0.17.1 and
0.18.6, hardcoded DNS key usage has been found in Netmaker allowing
unauth users to interact with DNS API endpoints. The issue is patched
in 0.17.1 and fixed in 0.18.6. If users are using 0.17.1, they should
run `docker pull gravitl/netmaker:v0.17.1` and `docker-compose up -d`.
This will switch them to the patched users. If users are using
v0.18.0-0.18.5, they should upgrade to v0.18.6 or later. As a
workaround, someone who is using version 0.17.1 can pull the latest
docker image of the backend and restart the server.

Wings is the server control plane for Pterodactyl Panel. A
vulnerability affecting versions prior to 1.7.5 and versions 1.11.0
prior to 1.11.6 impacts anyone running the affected versions of Wings.
This vulnerability can be used to gain access to the host system
running Wings if a user is able to modify an server's install script
or the install script executes code supplied by the user (either
through environment variables, or commands that execute commands based
off of user data). This vulnerability has been resolved in version
`v1.11.6` of Wings, and has been back-ported to the 1.7 release series
in `v1.7.5`. Anyone running `v1.11.x` should upgrade to `v1.11.6` and
anyone running `v1.7.x` should upgrade to `v1.7.5`. There are no
workarounds aside from upgrading. Running Wings with a rootless
container runtime may mitigate the severity of any attacks, however
the majority of users are using container runtimes that run as root as
per the Wings documentation. SELinux may prevent attackers from
performing certain operations against the host system, however
privileged containers have a lot of freedom even on systems with
SELinux enabled. It should be noted that this was a known attack
vector, for attackers to easily exploit this attack it would require
compromising an administrator account on a Panel. However, certain
eggs (the data structure that holds the install scripts that get
passed to Wings) have an issue where they are unknowingly executing
shell commands with escalated privileges provided by untrusted user
data.

Vert.x STOMP is a vert.x implementation of the STOMP specification
that provides a STOMP server and client. From versions 3.1.0 until
3.9.16 and 4.0.0 until 4.4.2, a Vert.x STOMP server processes client
STOMP frames without checking that the client send an initial CONNECT
frame replied with a successful CONNECTED frame. The client can
subscribe to a destination or publish message without prior
authentication. Any Vert.x STOMP server configured with an
authentication handler is impacted. The issue is patched in Vert.x
3.9.16 and 4.4.2. There are no trivial workarounds.

A potential security vulnerability has been identified in the
Enterprise Server Common Web Administration (ESCWA) component used in
Enterprise Server, Enterprise Test Server, Enterprise Developer,
Visual COBOL, and COBOL Server. An attacker would need to be
authenticated into ESCWA to attempt to exploit this vulnerability. As
described in the hardening guide in the product documentation, other
mitigations including restricting network access to ESCWA and
restricting users&#8364;&#8482; permissions in the Micro Focus Directory Server
also reduce the exposure to this issue. Given the right conditions
this vulnerability could be exploited to expose a service account
password. The account corresponding to the exposed credentials usually
has limited privileges and, in many cases would only be useful for
extracting details of other user accounts and similar information.

aiven-extras is a PostgreSQL extension. Versions prior to 1.1.9
contain a privilege escalation vulnerability, allowing elevation to
superuser inside PostgreSQL databases that use the aiven-extras
package. The vulnerability leverages missing schema qualifiers on
privileged functions called by the aiven-extras extension. A low
privileged user can create objects that collide with existing function
names, which will then be executed instead. Exploiting this
vulnerability could allow a low privileged user to acquire `superuser`
privileges, which would allow full, unrestricted access to all data
and database functions. And could lead to arbitrary code execution or
data access on the underlying host as the `postgres` user. The issue
has been patched as of version 1.1.9.

Sofia-SIP is an open-source SIP User-Agent library, compliant with the
IETF RFC3261 specification. Referring to [GHSA-8599-x7rq-
fr54](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-
sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54), several other potential
heap-over-flow and integer-overflow in stun_parse_attr_error_code and
stun_parse_attr_uint32 were found because the lack of attributes
length check when Sofia-SIP handles STUN packets. The previous patch
of [GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54](https://github.com/freeswitch/sofia-
sip/security/advisories/GHSA-8599-x7rq-fr54) fixed the vulnerability
when attr_type did not match the enum value, but there are also
vulnerabilities in the handling of other valid cases. The OOB read and
integer-overflow made by attacker may lead to crash, high consumption
of memory or even other more serious consequences. These issue have
been addressed in version 1.13.15. Users are advised to upgrade.

invoices.php in versions prior to 1.22.11.5781. This was happening
because of a coding error after validating parameters in POST
requests. There was no check for errors before adjusting invoice

request with malicious SQL for Time Tracker database. This issue has
been fixed in version 1.22.11.5781. Users are advised to upgrade.
Users unable to upgrade may insert an additional check for errors in a
condition before calling `ttGroupHelper::getActiveInvoices()` in
invoices.php.

PyMdown Extensions is a set of extensions for the `Python-Markdown`
markdown project. In affected versions an arbitrary file read is
possible when using include file syntax. By using the syntax
`--8<--"/etc/passwd"` or `--8<--"/proc/self/environ"` the content of
these files will be rendered in the generated documentation.
Additionally, a path relative to a specified, allowed base path can
also be used to render the content of a file outside the specified
base paths: `--8<-- "../../../../etc/passwd"`. Within the Snippets
extension, there exists a `base_path` option but the implementation is
vulnerable to Directory Traversal. The vulnerable section exists in

UmbracoIdentityExtensions is an Umbraco add-on package that enables
easy extensibility points for ASP.Net Identity integration. In
affected versions client secrets are not required which may expose
some endpoints to untrusted actors. Since Umbraco is not a single-page
application, the implicit flow is not safe. For traditional MVC
applications, it is recommended to use the authorization code flow,
which requires the client to authenticate with the authorization
server using a client secret. This flow provides better security, as
it involves exchanging an authorization code for an access token
and/or ID token, rather than directly returning tokens in the URL
fragment. This issue has been patched in commit `e792429f9` and a
release to Nuget is pending. Users are advised to upgrade when
possible.

Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded
programming assignments. A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the
MOSS cheat checker functionality of Autolab. To exploit this
vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions
needs to upload a specially crafted Tar file. Both "Base File Tar" and
"Additional file archive" can be fed with Tar files that contain paths
outside their target directories (e.g.,
`../../../../tmp/tarslipped2.sh`). When the MOSS cheat checker is
started the files inside of the archives are expanded to the attacker-
chosen locations. This issue may lead to arbitrary file write within
the scope of the running process. This issue has been addressed in
version 2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

CKAN is an open-source data management system for powering data hubs
and data portals. Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in
Ckan which may lead to remote code execution. An arbitrary file write
in `resource_create` and `package_update` actions, using the
`ResourceUploader` object. Also reachable via `package_create`,
`package_revise`, and `package_patch` via calls to `package_update`.
Remote code execution via unsafe pickle loading, via Beaker's session
store when configured to use the file session store backend. Potential
DOS due to lack of a length check on the resource id. Information
disclosure: A user with permission to create a resource can access any
other resource on the system if they know the id, even if they don't
have access to it. Resource overwrite: A user with permission to
create a resource can overwrite any resource if they know the id, even
if they don't have access to it. A user with permissions to create or
edit a dataset can upload a resource with a specially crafted id to
write the uploaded file in an arbitrary location. This can be
leveraged to Remote Code Execution via Beaker's insecure pickle
loading. All the above listed vulnerabilities have been fixed in CKAN
2.9.9 and CKAN 2.10.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for these issues.

Ombi is an open source application which allows users to request
specific media from popular self-hosted streaming servers. Versions
prior to 4.38.2 contain an arbitrary file read vulnerability where an
Ombi administrative user may access files available to the Ombi server
process on the host operating system. Ombi administrators may not
always be local system administrators and so this may violate the
security expectations of the system. The arbitrary file read
vulnerability was present in `ReadLogFile` and `Download` endpoints in
`SystemControllers.cs` as the parameter `logFileName` is not sanitized
before being combined with the `Logs` directory. When using
`Path.Combine(arg1, arg2, arg3)`, an attacker may be able to escape to
folders/files outside of `Path.Combine(arg1, arg2)` by using ".." in
`arg3`. In addition, by specifying an absolute path for `arg3`,
`Path.Combine` will completely ignore the first two arguments and just
return just `arg3`. This vulnerability can lead to information
disclosure. The Ombi `documentation` suggests running Ombi as a
Service with Administrator privileges. An attacker targeting such an
application may be able to read the files of any Windows user on the
host machine and certain system files. This issue has been addressed
in commit `b8a8f029` and in release version 4.38.2. Users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.
This issue is also tracked as GHSL-2023-088.

Teltonika&#8217;s Remote Management System versions prior to 4.10.0 contain
a function that allows users to claim their devices. This function
returns information based on whether the serial number of a device has
already been claimed, the MAC address of a device has already been
claimed, or whether the attempt to claim a device was successful. An
attacker could exploit this to create a list of the serial numbers and
MAC addresses of all devices cloud-connected to the Remote Management
System.

address of a device, they could authenticate as that device and steal
communication credentials of the device. This could allow an attacker
to enable arbitrary command execution as root by utilizing management
options within the newly registered devices.

Vyper is a pythonic Smart Contract Language for the ethereum virtual
machine. In contracts with more than one regular nonpayable function,
it is possible to send funds to the default function, even if the
default function is marked `nonpayable`. This applies to contracts
compiled with vyper versions prior to 0.3.8. This issue was fixed by
the removal of the global `calldatasize` check in commit `02339dfda`.
Users are advised to upgrade to version 0.3.8. Users unable to upgrade
should avoid use of nonpayable default functions.

Autolab is a course management service that enables auto-graded
programming assignments. A Tar slip vulnerability was found in the
Install assessment functionality of Autolab. To exploit this
vulnerability an authenticated attacker with instructor permissions
needs to upload a specially crafted Tar file. Using the install
assessment functionality an attacker can feed a Tar file that contain
files with paths pointing outside of the target directory (e.g.,
`../../../../tmp/tarslipped1.sh`). When the Install assessment form is
submitted the files inside of the archives are expanded to the
attacker-chosen locations. This issue has been addressed in version
2.11.0. Users are advised to upgrade.

Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool with unique topic-
based threading. Zulip administrators can configure Zulip to limit who
can add users to streams, and separately to limit who can invite users
to the organization. In Zulip Server 6.1 and below, the UI which
allows a user to invite a new user also allows them to set the streams
that the new user is invited to -- even if the inviting user would not
have permissions to add an existing user to streams. While such a
configuration is likely rare in practice, the behavior does violate
security-related controls. This does not let a user invite new users
to streams they cannot see, or would not be able to add users to if
they had that general permission. This issue has been addressed in
version 6.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may
limit sending of invitations down to users who also have the
permission to add users to streams.

subscribed to a private stream and have been removed from it since
retain the ability to edit messages/topics, move messages to other
streams, and delete messages that they used to have access to, if
other relevant organization permissions allow these actions. For
example, a user may be able to edit or delete their old messages they
posted in such a private stream. An administrator will be able to

Metabase is an open source business analytics engine. To edit SQL
Snippets, Metabase should have required people to be in at least one
group with native query editing permissions to a database&#8211;but affected
versions of Metabase didn't enforce that requirement. This lack of
enforcement meant that: Anyone&#8211;including people in sandboxed
groups&#8211;could edit SQL snippets. They could edit snippets via the API
or, in the application UI, when editing the metadata for a model based
on a SQL question, and people in sandboxed groups could edit a SQL
snippet used in a query that creates their sandbox. If the snippet
contained logic that restricted which data that person could see, they
could potentially edit that snippet and change their level of data
access. The permissions model for SQL snippets has been fixed in
Metabase versions 0.46.3, 0.45.4, 0.44.7, 1.46.3, 1.45.4, and 1.44.7.
Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure
that SQL queries used to create sandboxes exclude SQL snippets.

Requests is a HTTP library. Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been
leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when
redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use
`rebuild_proxies` to reattach the `Proxy-Authorization` header to
requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will
identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to
forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS,
the `Proxy-Authorization` header must be sent in the CONNECT request
as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results
in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server
unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate
sensitive information. This issue has been patched in version 2.31.0.

deactivated user to login when using uncommon configurations. This
only applies if any of the following are true: 1. JSON Web Tokens are
enabled for login via the `jwt_config.enabled` configuration setting.
2. The local password database is enabled via the
`password_config.enabled` and `password_config.localdb_enabled`
configuration settings *and* a user's password is updated via an admin
API after a user is deactivated. Note that the local password database
is enabled by default, but it is uncommon to set a user's password
after they've been deactivated. Installations that are configured to
only allow login via Single Sign-On (SSO) via CAS, SAML or OpenID
Connect (OIDC); or via an external password provider (e.g. LDAP) are

Lima launches Linux virtual machines, typically on macOS, for running
containerd. Prior to version 0.16.0, a virtual machine instance with a
malicious disk image could read a single file on the host filesystem,
even when no filesystem is mounted from the host. The official
templates of Lima and the well-known third party products (Colima,
Rancher Desktop, and Finch) are unlikely to be affected by this issue.
To exploit this issue, the attacker has to embed the target file path
(an absolute or a relative path from the instance directory) in a
malicious disk image, as the qcow2 (or vmdk) backing file path string.
As Lima refuses to run as the root, it is practically impossible for
the attacker to read the entire host disk via `/dev/rdiskN`. Also,
practically, the attacker cannot read at least the first 512 bytes
(MBR) of the target file. The issue has been patched in Lima in
version 0.16.0 by prohibiting using a backing file path in the VM base
image.

Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and

test plans, test cases, etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had
introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous
files from being uploaded. The upload validation checks were not
robust enough which left the possibility of an attacker to circumvent
them and upload a potentially dangerous file. Exploiting this flaw, a
combination of files could be uploaded so that they work together to

arbitrary JavaScript in the browser. This issue has been patched in
version 12.3.

Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any
infrastructure that can run Node.js. Versions prior to 5.4.4 and 6.1.1
are vulnerable to a phishing attack vulnerability that involves a user
uploading malicious files. A malicious user could upload an HTML file
to Parse Server via its public API. That HTML file would then be
accessible at the internet domain at which Parse Server is hosted. The
URL of the the uploaded HTML could be shared for phishing attacks. The
HTML page may seem legitimate because it is served under the internet
domain where Parse Server is hosted, which may be the same as a
company's official website domain. An additional security issue arises
when the Parse JavaScript SDK is used. The SDK stores sessions in the
internet browser's local storage, which usually restricts data access
depending on the internet domain. A malicious HTML file could contain
a script that retrieves the user's session token from local storage
and then share it with the attacker. The fix included in versions
5.4.4 and 6.1.1 adds a new Parse Server option
`fileUpload.fileExtensions` to restrict file upload on Parse Server by
file extension. It is recommended to restrict file upload for HTML
file extensions, which this fix disables by default. If an app
requires upload of files with HTML file extensions, the option can be
set to `['.*']` or another custom value to override the default.

A vulnerability exists in the memory management subsystem of the Linux
kernel. The lock handling for accessing and updating virtual memory
areas (VMAs) is incorrect, leading to use-after-free problems. This
issue can be successfully exploited to execute arbitrary kernel code,
escalate containers, and gain root privileges.

libspdm is a sample implementation that follows the DMTF SPDM
specifications. Prior to versions 2.3.3 and 3.0, following a
successful CAPABILITIES response, a libspdm Requester stores the
Responder's CTExponent into its context without validation. If the
Requester sends a request message that requires a cryptography
operation by the Responder, such as CHALLENGE, libspdm will calculate
the timeout value using the Responder's unvalidated CTExponent. A
patch is available in version 2.3.3. A workaround is also available.
After completion of VCA, the Requester can check the value of the
Responder's CTExponent. If it greater than or equal to 64, then the
Requester can stop communication with the Responder.

gost (GO Simple Tunnel) is a simple tunnel written in golang.
Sensitive secrets such as passwords, token and API keys should be
compared only using a constant-time comparison function. Untrusted
input, sourced from a HTTP header, is compared directly with a secret.
Since this comparison is not secure, an attacker can mount a side-
channel timing attack to guess the password. As a workaround, this can
be easily fixed using a constant time comparing function such as
`crypto/subtle`'s `ConstantTimeCompare`.

MeterSphere is an open source continuous testing platform. Version
2.9.1 and prior are vulnerable to denial of service. &#8203;The
`checkUserPassword` method is used to check whether the password
provided by the user matches the password saved in the database, and
the `CodingUtil.md5` method is used to encrypt the original password
with MD5 to ensure that the password will not be saved in plain text
when it is stored. If a user submits a very long password when logging
in, the system will be forced to execute the long password MD5
encryption process, causing the server CPU and memory to be exhausted,
thereby causing a denial of service attack on the server. This issue
is fixed in version 2.10.0-lts with a maximum password length.

In Splunk Enterprise versions below 9.1.0.2, 9.0.5.1, and 8.2.11.2, an
attacker can inject American National Standards Institute (ANSI)
escape codes into Splunk log files that, when a vulnerable terminal
application reads them, can potentially, at worst, result in possible
code execution in the vulnerable application. This attack requires a
user to use a terminal application that supports the translation of
ANSI escape codes to read the malicious log file locally in the
vulnerable terminal, and to perform additional user interaction to
exploit. Universal Forwarder versions 9.1.0.1, 9.0.5, 8.2.11, and
lower can be vulnerable in situations where they have management
services active and accessible over the network. Universal Forwarder
versions 9.0.x and 9.1.x bind management services to the local machine
and are not vulnerable in this specific configuration. See
SVD-2022-0605 for more information. Universal Forwarder versions 9.1
use Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for communication, which further reduces
the potential attack surface. The vulnerability does not directly
affect Splunk Enterprise or Universal Forwarder. The indirect impact
on Splunk Enterprise and Universal Forwarder can vary significantly
depending on the permissions in the vulnerable terminal application
and where and how the user reads the malicious log file. For example,
users can copy the malicious file from the Splunk Enterprise instance
and read it on their local machine.

When gRPC HTTP2 stack raised a header size exceeded error, it skipped
parsing the rest of the HPACK frame. This caused any HPACK table
mutations to also be skipped, resulting in a desynchronization of
HPACK tables between sender and receiver. If leveraged, say, between a
proxy and a backend, this could lead to requests from the proxy being
interpreted as containing headers from different proxy clients -
leading to an information leak that can be used for privilege
escalation or data exfiltration. We recommend upgrading beyond the

Pydio Cells through 4.1.2 allows XSS. Pydio Cells implements the
download of files using presigned URLs which are generated using the
Amazon AWS SDK for JavaScript [1]. The secrets used to sign these URLs
are hardcoded and exposed through the JavaScript files of the web
application. Therefore, it is possible to generate valid signatures
for arbitrary download URLs. By uploading an HTML file and modifying
the download URL to serve the file inline instead of as an attachment,
any included JavaScript code is executed when the URL is opened in a
browser, leading to a cross-site scripting vulnerability.

BigBlueButton is an open source virtual classroom designed to help
teachers teach and learners learn. In affected versions are affected
by a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. In an
`insertDocument` API request the user is able to supply a URL from
which the presentation should be downloaded. This URL was being used
without having been successfully validated first. An update to the
`followRedirect` method in the `PresentationUrlDownloadService` has
been made to validate all URLs to be used for presentation download.
Two new properties `presentationDownloadSupportedProtocols` and
`presentationDownloadBlockedHosts` have also been added to
`bigbluebutton.properties` to allow administrators to define what
protocols a URL must use and to explicitly define hosts that a
presentation cannot be downloaded from. All URLs passed to
`insertDocument` must conform to the requirements of the two
previously mentioned properties. Additionally, these URLs must resolve
to valid addresses, and these addresses must not be local or loopback
addresses. There are no workarounds. Users are advised to upgrade to a
patched version of BigBlueButton.

Xibo is a content management system (CMS). A path traversal
vulnerability exists in the Xibo CMS whereby a specially crafted zip
file can be uploaded to the CMS via the layout import function by an
authenticated user which would allow creation of files outside of the
CMS library directory as the webserver user. This can be used to
upload a PHP webshell inside the web root directory and achieve remote
code execution as the webserver user. Users should upgrade to version
2.3.17 or 3.3.5, which fix this issue. Customers who host their CMS
with Xibo Signage have already received an upgrade or patch to resolve
this issue regardless of the CMS version that they are running.

Xibo is a content management system (CMS). An SQL injection
vulnerability was discovered in the `/dataset/data/{id}` API route
inside the CMS starting in version 1.4.0 and prior to versions 2.3.17
and 3.3.5. This allows an authenticated user to exfiltrate data from
the Xibo database by injecting specially crafted values in to the
`filter` parameter. Values allowed in the filter parameter are checked
against a deny list of commands that should not be allowed, however
this checking was done in a case sensitive manor and so it is possible
to bypass these checks by using unusual case combinations. Users
should upgrade to version 2.3.17 or 3.3.5, which fix this issue. There
are no workarounds aside from upgrading.

Django-SES is a drop-in mail backend for Django. The django_ses
library implements a mail backend for Django using AWS Simple Email
Service. The library exports the `SESEventWebhookView class` intended
to receive signed requests from AWS to handle email bounces,
subscriptions, etc. These requests are signed by AWS and are verified
by django_ses, however the verification of this signature was found to
be flawed as it allowed users to specify arbitrary public
certificates. This issue was patched in version 3.5.0.

Highlight is an open source, full-stack monitoring platform. Highlight
may record passwords on customer deployments when a password html
input is switched to `type="text"` via a javascript "Show Password"
button. This differs from the expected behavior which always
obfuscates `type="password"` inputs. A customer may assume that
switching to `type="text"` would also not record this input; hence,
they would not add additional `highlight-mask` css-class obfuscation
to this part of the DOM, resulting in unintentional recording of a
password value when a `Show Password` button is used. This issue was
patched in version 6.0.0. This patch tracks changes to the `type`
attribute of an input to ensure an input that used to be a
`type="password"` continues to be obfuscated.

Omni-notes is an open source note-taking application for Android. The
Omni-notes Android app had an insufficient path validation
vulnerability when displaying the details of a note received through
an externally-provided intent. The paths of the note's attachments
were not properly validated, allowing malicious or compromised
applications in the same device to force Omni-notes to copy files from
its internal storage to its external storage directory, where they
would have become accessible to any component with permission to read
the external storage. Updating to the newest version (6.2.7) of Omni-
notes Android fixes this vulnerability.

ntpd-rs is an NTP implementation written in Rust. ntpd-rs does not
validate the length of NTS cookies in received NTP packets to the
server. An attacker can crash the server by sending a specially
crafted NTP packet containing a cookie shorter than what the server
expects. The server also crashes when it is not configured to handle
NTS packets. The issue was caused by improper slice indexing. The
indexing operations were replaced by safer alternatives that do not
crash the ntpd-rs server process but instead properly handle the error
condition. A patch was released in version 0.3.3.

Reference: MLIST:[debian-lts-announce] 20230802 [SECURITY] [DLA 3514-1] bouncycastle security update
Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/08/msg00000.html

Bouncy Castle For Java before 1.74 is affected by an LDAP injection
vulnerability. The vulnerability only affects applications that use an
LDAP CertStore from Bouncy Castle to validate X.509 certificates.
During the certificate validation process, Bouncy Castle inserts the
certificate's Subject Name into an LDAP search filter without any
escaping, which leads to an LDAP injection vulnerability.

Reference: CONFIRM:https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20240125-0001/
Reference: MISC:https://bouncycastle.org

Bouncy Castle for Java before 1.73 contains a potential Denial of
Service (DoS) issue within the Bouncy Castle
org.bouncycastle.openssl.PEMParser class. This class parses OpenSSL
PEM encoded streams containing X.509 certificates, PKCS8 encoded keys,
and PKCS7 objects. Parsing a file that has crafted ASN.1 data through
the PEMParser causes an OutOfMemoryError, which can enable a denial of
service attack. (For users of the FIPS Java API: BC-FJA 1.0.2.3 and
earlier are affected; BC-FJA 1.0.2.4 is fixed.)

TN-4900 Series firmware versions v1.2.4 and prior and TN-5900 Series
firmware versions v3.3 and prior are vulnerable to the command
injection vulnerability. This vulnerability stems from insufficient
input validation in the key-generation function, which could
potentially allow malicious users to execute remote code on affected
devices.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/07/12/1

For RocketMQ versions 5.1.0 and below, under certain conditions, there
is a risk of remote command execution. Several components of RocketMQ,
including NameServer, Broker, and Controller, are leaked on the
extranet and lack permission verification, an attacker can exploit
this vulnerability by using the update configuration function to

Additionally, an attacker can achieve the same effect by forging the
RocketMQ protocol content. To prevent these attacks, users are
recommended to upgrade to version 5.1.1 or above for using RocketMQ

The CMS Commander plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
bypass due to the use of an insufficiently unique cryptographic
signature on the 'cmsc_add_site' function in versions up to, and
including, 2.287. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
to the plugin to change the '_cmsc_public_key' in the plugin config,
providing access to the plugin's remote control functionalities, such
as creating an admin access URL, which can be used for privilege
escalation. This can only be exploited if the plugin has not been
configured yet, however, if combined with another arbitrary plugin
installation and activation vulnerability, the impact can be severe.

pam_krb5 authenticates a user by essentially running kinit with the
password, getting a ticket-granting ticket (tgt) from the Kerberos KDC
(Key Distribution Center) over the network, as a way to verify the
password. However, if a keytab is not provisioned on the system,
pam_krb5 has no way to validate the response from the KDC, and
essentially trusts the tgt provided over the network as being valid.
In a non-default FreeBSD installation that leverages pam_krb5 for
authentication and does not have a keytab provisioned, an attacker
that is able to control both the password and the KDC responses can
return a valid tgt, allowing authentication to occur for any user on
the system.

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://kaios.dev/cve/1410290

An issue was discovered in KaiOS 3.0 and 3.1. The binary
/system/kaios/api-daemon exposes a local web server on *.localhost

Name: CVE-2023-33294
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://kaios.dev/cve/1411380

An issue was discovered in KaiOS 3.0 before 3.1. The
/system/bin/tctweb_server binary exposes a local web server that
responds to GET and POST requests on port 2929. The server accepts
arbitrary Bash commands and executes them as root. Because it is not
permission or context restricted and returns proper CORS headers, it's
accessible to all websites via the browser. At a bare minimum, this
allows an attacker to retrieve a list of the user's installed apps,
notifications, and downloads. It also allows an attacker to delete
local files and modify system properties including the boolean
persist.moz.killswitch property (which would render the device
inoperable). This vulnerability is partially mitigated by SELinux
which prevents reads, writes, or modifications to files or permissions
within protected partitions.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/20/2

The code that processes control channel messages sent to `named` calls
certain functions recursively during packet parsing. Recursion depth
is only limited by the maximum accepted packet size; depending on the
environment, this may cause the packet-parsing code to run out of
available stack memory, causing `named` to terminate unexpectedly.
Since each incoming control channel message is fully parsed before its
contents are authenticated, exploiting this flaw does not require the
attacker to hold a valid RNDC key; only network access to the control
channel's configured TCP port is necessary. This issue affects BIND 9
versions 9.2.0 through 9.16.43, 9.18.0 through 9.18.18, 9.19.0 through
9.19.16, 9.9.3-S1 through 9.16.43-S1, and 9.18.0-S1 through

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/03/msg00012.html

A flaw was found in the QEMU built-in VNC server. When a client
connects to the VNC server, QEMU checks whether the current number of
connections crosses a certain threshold and if so, cleans up the
previous connection. If the previous connection happens to be in the
handshake phase and fails, QEMU cleans up the connection again,
resulting in a NULL pointer dereference issue. This could allow a
remote unauthenticated client to cause a denial of service.

gRPC contains a vulnerability that allows hpack table accounting
errors could lead to unwanted disconnects between clients and servers
in exceptional cases/ Three vectors were found that allow the
following DOS attacks: - Unbounded memory buffering in the HPACK
parser - Unbounded CPU consumption in the HPACK parser The unbounded
CPU consumption is down to a copy that occurred per-input-block in the
parser, and because that could be unbounded due to the memory copy bug
we end up with an O(n^2) parsing loop, with n selected by the client.
The unbounded memory buffering bugs: - The header size limit check was
behind the string reading code, so we needed to first buffer up to a 4
gigabyte string before rejecting it as longer than 8 or 16kb. - HPACK
varints have an encoding quirk whereby an infinite number of 0&#8217;s can
be added at the start of an integer. gRPC&#8217;s hpack parser needed to
read all of them before concluding a parse. - gRPC&#8217;s metadata overflow
check was performed per frame, so that the following sequence of
frames could cause infinite buffering: HEADERS: containing a: 1
CONTINUATION: containing a: 2 CONTINUATION: containing a: 3 etc&#8230;

Kanboard is open source project management software that focuses on
the Kanban methodology. Versions prior to 1.2.30 are subject to an
Insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerability present in the
application's URL parameter. This vulnerability enables any user to
read files uploaded by any other user, regardless of their privileges
or restrictions. By Changing the file_id any user can render all the
files where MimeType is image uploaded under **/files** directory
regard less of uploaded by any user. This vulnerability poses a
significant impact and severity to the application's security. By
manipulating the URL parameter, an attacker can access sensitive files
that should only be available to authorized users. This includes
confidential documents or any other type of file stored within the
application. The ability to read these files can lead to various
detrimental consequences, such as unauthorized disclosure of sensitive
information, privacy breaches, intellectual property theft, or
exposure of trade secrets. Additionally, it could result in legal and
regulatory implications, reputation damage, financial losses, and
potential compromise of user trust. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

JStachio is a type-safe Java Mustache templating engine. Prior to
version 1.0.1, JStachio fails to escape single quotes `'` in HTML,
allowing an attacker to inject malicious code. This vulnerability can
be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in
the context of other users visiting pages that use this template
engine. This can lead to various consequences, including session
hijacking, defacement of web pages, theft of sensitive information, or
even the propagation of malware. Version 1.0.1 contains a patch for
this issue. To mitigate this vulnerability, the template engine should
properly escape special characters, including single quotes. Common
practice is to escape `'` as `&#39`. As a workaround, users can avoid
this issue by using only double quotes `"` for HTML attributes.

mx-chain-go is an implementation of the MultiversX blockchain protocol
written in the Go language. Metachain cannot process a cross-shard
miniblock. Prior to version 1.4.16, an invalid transaction with the
wrong username on metachain is not treated correctly on the metachain
transaction processor. This is strictly a processing issue that could
have happened on MultiversX chain. If an error like this had occurred,
the metachain would have stopped notarizing blocks from the shard
chains. The resuming of notarization is possible only after applying a
patched binary version. A patch in version 1.4.16 introduces
`processIfTxErrorCrossShard` for the metachain transaction processor.
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Brook is a cross-platform programmable network tool. The `tproxy`
server is vulnerable to a drive-by command injection. An attacker may
fool a victim into visiting a malicious web page which will trigger
requests to the local `tproxy` service leading to remote code
execution. A patch is available in version 20230606.

Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. In deno 1.34.0 and
deno_runtime 0.114.0, outbound HTTP requests made using the built-in
`node:http` or `node:https` modules are incorrectly not checked
against the network permission allow list (`--allow-net`).
Dependencies relying on these built-in modules are subject to the
vulnerability too. Users of Deno versions prior to 1.34.0 are
unaffected. Deno Deploy users are unaffected. This problem has been
patched in Deno v1.34.1 and deno_runtime 0.114.1 and all users are
recommended to update to this version. No workaround is available for
this issue.

Kanboard is open source project management software that focuses on
the Kanban methodology. Versions prior to 1.2.30 are subject to a
missing access control vulnerability that allows a user with low
privileges to create or transfer tasks to any project within the
software, even if they have not been invited or the project is
personal. The vulnerable features are `Duplicate to project` and `Move
to project`, which both utilize the `checkDestinationProjectValues()`
function to check his values. This issue has been addressed in version
1.2.30. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
for this vulnerability.

Kanboard is open source project management software that focuses on
the Kanban methodology. A stored Cross site scripting (XSS) allows an
attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript and any user who views the
task containing the malicious code will be exposed to the XSS attack.
Note: The default CSP header configuration blocks this javascript
attack. This issue has been addressed in version 1.2.30. Users are
advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that they
have a restrictive CSP header config.

RIOT-OS, an operating system for Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
contains a network stack with the ability to process 6LoWPAN frames.
In version 2023.01 and prior, an attacker can send a crafted frame to
the device resulting in an out of bounds write in the packet buffer.
The overflow can be used to corrupt other packets and the allocator
metadata. Corrupting a pointer will easily lead to denial of service.
While carefully manipulating the allocator metadata gives an attacker
the possibility to write data to arbitrary locations and thus execute
arbitrary code. This issue is fixed in pull request 19680. As a
workaround, disable support for fragmented IP datagrams.

Kiwi TCMS is an open source test management system for both manual and
automated testing. Kiwi TCMS allows users to upload attachments to
test plans, test cases, etc. Earlier versions of Kiwi TCMS had
introduced upload validators in order to prevent potentially dangerous
files from being uploaded and Content-Security-Policy definition to
prevent cross-site-scripting attacks. The upload validation checks
were not 100% robust which left the possibility to circumvent them and
upload a potentially dangerous file which allows execution of
arbitrary JavaScript in the browser. Additionally we've discovered
that Nginx's `proxy_pass` directive will strip some headers negating
protections built into Kiwi TCMS when served behind a reverse proxy.
This issue has been addressed in version 12.4. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade who are serving Kiwi TCMS behind a
reverse proxy should make sure that additional header values are still
passed to the client browser. If they aren't redefining them inside
the proxy configuration.

gpt_academic provides a graphical interface for ChatGPT/GLM. A
vulnerability was found in gpt_academic 3.37 and prior. This issue
affects some unknown processing of the component Configuration File
Handler. The manipulation of the argument file leads to information
disclosure. Since no sensitive files are configured to be off-limits,
sensitive information files in some working directories can be read
through the `/file` route, leading to sensitive information leakage.
This affects users that uses file configurations via `config.py`,
`config_private.py`, `Dockerfile`. A patch is available at commit
1dcc2873d2168ad2d3d70afcb453ac1695fbdf02. As a workaround, one may use
environment variables instead of `config*.py` files to configure this
project, or use docker-compose installation to configure this project.

Spring Security versions 5.8 prior to 5.8.5, 6.0 prior to 6.0.5, and
6.1 prior to 6.1.2 could be susceptible to authorization rule
misconfiguration if the application uses requestMatchers(String) and
multiple servlets, one of them being Spring MVC&#8217;s DispatcherServlet.
(DispatcherServlet is a Spring MVC component that maps HTTP endpoints
to methods on @Controller-annotated classes.) Specifically, an
application is vulnerable when all of the following are true: * Spring
MVC is on the classpath * Spring Security is securing more than one
servlet in a single application (one of them being Spring MVC&#8217;s
DispatcherServlet) * The application uses requestMatchers(String) to
refer to endpoints that are not Spring MVC endpoints An application is
not vulnerable if any of the following is true: * The application does
not have Spring MVC on the classpath * The application secures no
servlets other than Spring MVC&#8217;s DispatcherServlet * The application
uses requestMatchers(String) only for Spring MVC endpoints

Reactive web applications that use Spring HATEOAS to produce
hypermedia-based responses might be exposed to malicious forwarded
headers if they are not behind a trusted proxy that ensures
correctness of such headers, or if they don't have anything else in
place to handle (and possibly discard) forwarded headers either in
WebFlux or at the level of the underlying HTTP server. For the
application to be affected, it needs to satisfy the following
requirements: * It needs to use the reactive web stack (Spring
WebFlux) and Spring HATEOAS to create links in hypermedia-based
responses. * The application infrastructure does not guard against
clients submitting (X-)Forwarded&#8230; headers.

The ProfileGrid plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
decryption of private information in versions up to, and including,
5.5.0. This is due to the passphrase and iv being hardcoded in the
'pm_encrypt_decrypt_pass' function and used across all sites running
the plugin. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with
administrator-level permissions or above to decrypt and view users'
passwords. If combined with another vulnerability, this can
potentially grant lower-privileged users access to users' passwords.

In Spring for Apache Kafka 3.0.9 and earlier and versions 2.9.10 and
earlier, a possible deserialization attack vector existed, but only if
unusual configuration was applied. An attacker would have to construct
a malicious serialized object in one of the deserialization exception
record headers. Specifically, an application is vulnerable when all of
the following are true: * The user does not configure an
ErrorHandlingDeserializer for the key and/or value of the record * The
user explicitly sets container properties checkDeserExWhenKeyNull
and/or checkDeserExWhenValueNull container properties to true. * The
user allows untrusted sources to publish to a Kafka topic By default,
these properties are false, and the container only attempts to
deserialize the headers if an ErrorHandlingDeserializer is configured.
The ErrorHandlingDeserializer prevents the vulnerability by removing
any such malicious headers before processing the record.

VMware Cloud Director Appliance contains an authentication bypass
vulnerability in case VMware Cloud Director Appliance was upgraded to
10.5 from an older version. On an upgraded version of VMware Cloud
Director Appliance 10.5, a malicious actor with network access to the
appliance can bypass login restrictions when authenticating on port 22
(ssh) or port 5480 (appliance management console) . This bypass is not
present on port 443 (VCD provider and tenant login). On a new
installation of VMware Cloud Director Appliance 10.5, the bypass is
not present. VMware Cloud Director Appliance is impacted since it uses
an affected version of sssd from the underlying Photon OS. The sssd
issue is no longer present in versions of Photon OS that ship with
sssd-2.8.1-11 or higher (Photon OS 3) or sssd-2.8.2-9 or higher
(Photon OS 4 and 5).

Collabora Online is a collaborative online office suite. A stored
cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in Collabora Online
prior to versions 22.05.13, 21.11.9.1, and 6.4.27. An attacker could
create a document with an XSS payload as a document name. Later, if an
administrator opened the admin console and navigated to the history
page, the document name was injected as unescaped HTML and executed as
a script inside the context of the admin console. The administrator
JSON web token (JWT) used for the websocket connection could be leaked
through this flaw. Users should upgrade to Collabora Online 22.05.13
or higher; Collabora Online 21.11.9.1 or higher; Collabora Online
6.4.27 or higher to receive a patch.

Decidim is a participatory democracy framework, written in Ruby on
Rails, originally developed for the Barcelona City government online
and offline participation website. Decidim uses a third-party library
named Ransack for filtering certain database collections (e.g., public
meetings). By default, this library allows filtering on all data
attributes and associations. This allows an unauthenticated remote
attacker to exfiltrate non-public data from the underlying database of
a Decidim instance (e.g., exfiltrating data from the user table). This
issue may lead to Sensitive Data Disclosure. The problem was patched
in version 0.27.3.

Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. In versions of
Kyverno prior to 1.10.0, resources which have the `deletionTimestamp`
field defined can bypass validate, generate, or mutate-existing
policies, even in cases where the `validationFailureAction` field is
set to `Enforce`. This situation occurs as resources pending deletion
were being consciously exempted by Kyverno, as a way to reduce
processing load as policies are typically not applied to objects which
are being deleted. However, this could potentially result in allowing
a malicious user to leverage the Kubernetes finalizers feature by
setting a finalizer which causes the Kubernetes API server to set the
`deletionTimestamp` and then not completing the delete operation as a
way to explicitly to bypass a Kyverno policy. Note that this is not
applicable to Kubernetes Pods but, as an example, a Kubernetes Service
resource can be manipulated using an indefinite finalizer to bypass
policies. This is resolved in Kyverno 1.10.0. There is no known
workaround.

Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to
version 4.10.8, anyone (Strapi developers, users, plugins) can make
every attribute of a Content-Type public without knowing it. The
vulnerability only affects the handling of content types by Strapi,
not the actual content types themselves. Users can use plugins or
modify their own content types without realizing that the
`privateAttributes` getter is being removed, which can result in any
attribute becoming public. This can lead to sensitive information
being exposed or the entire system being taken control of by an
attacker(having access to password hashes). Anyone can be impacted,
depending on how people are using/extending content-types. If the
users are mutating the content-type, they will not be affected.
Version 4.10.8 contains a patch for this issue.

ChuanhuChatGPT is a graphical user interface for ChatGPT and many
large language models. A vulnerability in versions 20230526 and prior
allows unauthorized access to the config.json file of the privately
deployed ChuanghuChatGPT project, when authentication is not
configured. The attacker can exploit this vulnerability to steal the
API keys in the configuration file. The vulnerability has been fixed
in commit bfac445. As a workaround, setting up access authentication
can help mitigate the vulnerability.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20230614 CVE-2023-34095: cpdb-libs: Buffer overflows via scanf
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/06/14/7

cpdb-libs provides frontend and backend libraries for the Common
Printing Dialog Backends (CPDB) project. In versions 1.0 through
2.0b4, cpdb-libs is vulnerable to buffer overflows via improper use of
`scanf(3)`. cpdb-libs uses the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions to
parse command lines and configuration files, dropping the read string
components into fixed-length buffers, but does not limit the length of
the strings to be read by `fscanf()` and `scanf()` causing buffer
overflows when a string is longer than 1023 characters. A patch for
this issue is available at commit
f181bd1f14757c2ae0f17cc76dc20421a40f30b7. As all buffers have a length
of 1024 characters, the patch limits the maximum string length to be
read to 1023 by replacing all occurrences of `%s` with `%1023s` in all
calls of the `fscanf()` and `scanf()` functions.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT
devices. When reading the TCP MSS option value from an incoming
packet, the Contiki-NG OS does not verify that certain buffer indices
to read from are within the bounds of the IPv6 packet buffer, uip_buf.
In particular, there is a 2-byte buffer read in the module
os/net/ipv6/uip6.c. The buffer is indexed using 'UIP_IPTCPH_LEN + 2 +
c' and 'UIP_IPTCPH_LEN + 3 + c', but the uip_buf buffer may not have
enough data, resulting in a 2-byte read out of bounds. The problem has
been patched in the "develop" branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to
be included in release 4.9. Users are advised to watch for the 4.9
release and to upgrade when it becomes available. There are no
workarounds for this vulnerability aside from manually patching with
the diff in commit `cde4e9839`.

Contiki-NG is an operating system for internet of things devices. In
version 4.8 and prior, when processing ICMP DAO packets in the
`dao_input_storing` function, the Contiki-NG OS does not verify that
the packet buffer is big enough to contain the bytes it needs before
accessing them. Up to 16 bytes can be read out of bounds in the
`dao_input_storing` function. An attacker can truncate an ICMP packet
so that it does not contain enough data, leading to an out-of-bounds
read on these lines. The problem has been patched in the "develop"
branch of Contiki-NG, and is expected to be included in release 4.9.
As a workaround, one can apply the changes in Contiki-NG pull request
#2435 to patch the system.

fast-xml-parser is an open source, pure javascript xml parser. fast-
xml-parser allows special characters in entity names, which are not
escaped or sanitized. Since the entity name is used for creating a
regex for searching and replacing entities in the XML body, an
attacker can abuse it for denial of service (DoS) attacks. By crafting
an entity name that results in an intentionally bad performing regex
and utilizing it in the entity replacement step of the parser, this
can cause the parser to stall for an indefinite amount of time. This
problem has been resolved in v4.2.4. Users are advised to upgrade.
Users unable to upgrade should avoid using DOCTYPE parsing by setting
the `processEntities: false` option.

mailcow is a mail server suite based on Dovecot, Postfix and other
open source software, that provides a modern web UI for user/server
administration. A vulnerability has been discovered in mailcow which
allows an attacker to manipulate internal Dovecot variables by using
specially crafted passwords during the authentication process. The
issue arises from the behavior of the `passwd-verify.lua` script,
which is responsible for verifying user passwords during login
attempts. Upon a successful login, the script returns a response in
the format of "password=<valid-password>", indicating the successful
authentication. By crafting a password with additional key-value pairs
appended to it, an attacker can manipulate the returned string and
influence the internal behavior of Dovecot. For example, using the
password "123 mail_crypt_save_version=0" would cause the `passwd-
verify.lua` script to return the string "password=123
mail_crypt_save_version=0". Consequently, Dovecot will interpret this
string and set the internal variables accordingly, leading to
unintended consequences. This vulnerability can be exploited by an
authenticated attacker who has the ability to set their own password.
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in
unauthorized access to user accounts, bypassing security controls, or
other malicious activities. This issue has been patched in version
`2023-05a`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

zxcvbn-ts is an open source password strength estimator written in
typescript. This vulnerability affects users running on the nodeJS
platform which are using the second argument of the zxcvbn function.
It can result in an unbounded resource consumption as the user inputs
array is extended with every function call. Browsers are impacted, too
but a single user need to do a lot of input changes so that it affects
the browser, while the node process gets the inputs of every user of a
platform and can be killed that way. This problem has been patched in
version 3.0.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
should stop using the second argument of the zxcvbn function and use
the zxcvbnOptions.setOptions function.

Lite plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery
in versions up to, and including, 1.0.0. This is due to missing nonce
validation on the ajax_store_save() function. This makes it possible
for unauthenticated attackers to modify plugin settings and inject
malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a
site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
link.

The `Release PR Merged` workflow in the github repo
taosdata/grafanaplugin is subject to a command injection vulnerability
which allows for arbitrary code execution within the github action
context due to the insecure usage of `${{
github.event.pull_request.title }}` in a bash command within the
GitHub workflow. Attackers can inject malicious commands which will be
executed by the workflow. This happens because `${{
github.event.pull_request.title }}` is directly passed to bash command
on like 25 of the workflow. This may allow an attacker to gain access
to secrets which the github action has access to or to otherwise make
use of the compute resources.

JavaCPP Presets is a project providing Java distributions of native
C++ libraries. All the actions in the `bytedeco/javacpp-presets` use
the `github.event.head_commit.message&#8203;` parameter in an insecure way.
For example, the commit message is used in a run statement - resulting
in a command injection vulnerability due to string interpolation. No
exploitation has been reported. This issue has been addressed in
version 1.5.9. Users of JavaCPP Presets are advised to upgrade as a
precaution.

An issue was discovered in SystemFirmwareManagementRuntimeDxe in
Insyde InsydeH2O with kernel 5.0 through 5.5. The implementation of
the GetImage method retrieves the value of a runtime variable named
GetImageProgress, and later uses this value as a function pointer.
This variable is wiped out by the same module near the end of the
function. By setting this UEFI variable from the OS to point into
custom code, an attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution in the
DXE phase, before several chipset locks are set.
