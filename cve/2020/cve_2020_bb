The Apache Spark UI offers the possibility to enable ACLs via the
configuration option spark.acls.enable. With an authentication filter,
this checks whether a user has access permissions to view or modify
the application. If ACLs are enabled, a code path in
HttpSecurityFilter can allow someone to perform impersonation by
providing an arbitrary user name. A malicious user might then be able
to reach a permission check function that will ultimately build a Unix
shell command based on their input, and execute it. This will result
in arbitrary shell command execution as the user Spark is currently
running as. This affects Apache Spark versions 3.0.3 and earlier,
versions 3.1.1 to 3.1.2, and versions 3.2.0 to 3.2.1.

Apache Commons Configuration performs variable interpolation, allowing
properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard
format for interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix" is used
to locate an instance of
org.apache.commons.configuration2.interpol.Lookup that performs the
interpolation. Starting with version 2.4 and continuing through 2.7,
the set of default Lookup instances included interpolators that could
result in arbitrary code execution or contact with remote servers.
These lookups are: - "script" - execute expressions using the JVM
script execution engine (javax.script) - "dns" - resolve dns records -
"url" - load values from urls, including from remote servers
Applications using the interpolation defaults in the affected versions
may be vulnerable to remote code execution or unintentional contact
with remote servers if untrusted configuration values are used. Users
are recommended to upgrade to Apache Commons Configuration 2.8.0,
which disables the problematic interpolators by default.

Fossil 2.18 on Windows allows attackers to cause a denial of service
(daemon crash) via an XSS payload in a ticket. This occurs because the
ticket data is stored in a temporary file, and the product does not
properly handle the absence of this file after Windows Defender has
flagged it as malware.

Reference: URL:https://www.wordfence.com/vulnerability-advisories-continued/#CVE-2022-3401

The Bricks theme for WordPress is vulnerable to remote code execution
due to the theme allowing site editors to include executable code
blocks in website content in versions 1.2 to 1.5.3. This, combined
with the missing authorization vulnerability (CVE-2022-3400), makes it
possible for authenticated attackers with minimal permissions, such as
a subscriber, can edit any page, post, or template on the vulnerable
WordPress website and inject a code execution block that can be used
to achieve remote code execution.

The Log HTTP Requests plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
Cross-Site Scripting via logged HTTP requests in versions up to, and
including, 1.3.1 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers who can
trick a site's administrator into performing an action like clicking
on a link, or an authenticated user with access to a page that sends a
request using user-supplied data via the server, to inject arbitrary
web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an
injected page.

An attacker can pre-create the `/Applications/Google\
Drive.app/Contents/MacOS` directory which is expected to be owned by
root to be owned by a non-root user. When the Drive for Desktop
installer is run for the first time, it will place a binary in that
directory with execute permissions and set its setuid bit. Since the
attacker owns the directory, the attacker can replace the binary with
a symlink, causing the installer to set the setuid bit on the symlink.
When the symlink is executed, it will run with root permissions. We
recommend upgrading past version 64.0

Reference: URL:https://pulsar.apache.org/security/CVE-2022-34321/

Improper Authentication vulnerability in Apache Pulsar Proxy allows an
attacker to connect to the /proxy-stats endpoint without
authentication. The vulnerable endpoint exposes detailed statistics
about live connections, along with the capability to modify the
logging level of proxied connections without requiring proper
authentication credentials. This issue affects Apache Pulsar versions
from 2.6.0 to 2.10.5, from 2.11.0 to 2.11.2, from 3.0.0 to 3.0.1, and
3.1.0. The known risks include exposing sensitive information such as
connected client IP and unauthorized logging level manipulation which
could lead to a denial-of-service condition by significantly
increasing the proxy's logging overhead. When deployed via the Apache
Pulsar Helm chart within Kubernetes environments, the actual client IP
might not be revealed through the load balancer's default behavior,
which typically obscures the original source IP addresses when
externalTrafficPolicy is being configured to "Cluster" by default. The
/proxy-stats endpoint contains topic level statistics, however, in the
default configuration, the topic level statistics aren't known to be
exposed. 2.10 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.10.6.
2.11 Pulsar Proxy users should upgrade to at least 2.11.3. 3.0 Pulsar
Proxy users should upgrade to at least 3.0.2. 3.1 Pulsar Proxy users
should upgrade to at least 3.1.1. Users operating versions prior to
those listed above should upgrade to the aforementioned patched
versions or newer versions. Additionally, it's imperative to recognize
that the Apache Pulsar Proxy is not intended for direct exposure to
the internet. The architectural design of Pulsar Proxy assumes that it
will operate within a secured network environment, safeguarded by
appropriate perimeter defenses.

alert is interpreted as HTML, and can thus embed JavaScript code,
which is executed when displayed. This is a stored XSS. (Also, an
issue is present in the File download feature, accessible via
/OnlineBanking/cgi/isapi.dll/DOWNLOADFRS. When requesting to show the
list of downloadable files, the contents of three form fields are
embedded in the JavaScript code without prior sanitization. This is

Tabit - sensitive information disclosure. Several APIs on the web
system display, without authorization, sensitive information such as
health statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol
consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described API&#8217;s, has in
its URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate.
However, they each receive a &#8216;tiny URL&#8217; in Tabit&#8217;s domain, in the form
of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 characters long
string containing numbers, lower- and upper-case letters. It is not so
simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work
and lead to a personal endpoint. This is both an example of OWASP:
API4 - rate limiting and OWASP: API1 - Broken object level
authorization. Furthermore, the redirect URL disclosed the MongoDB IDs
discussed above, and we could use them to query other endpoints
disclosing more personal information. For example: The URL
https://tabitisrael.co.il/online-reservations/health-
statement?orgId={org_id}&healthStatementId={health_statement_id} is
used to invite friends to fill a health statement before attending the
restaurant. We can use the health_statement_id to access the
https://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/health-statement/{health_statement_id} API
which disclose medical information as well as id number.

API which returns a lot of data regarding the reservation (OWASP:
API3): Name, mail, phone number, the number of visits of the user to
this specific restaurant, the money he spent there, the money he spent
on alcohol, whether he left a deposit etc. This information can easily
be used for a phishing attack.

Tabit - giftcard stealth. Several APIs on the web system display,
without authorization, sensitive information such as health
statements, previous bills in a specific restaurant, alcohol
consumption and smoking habits. Each of the described APIs, has in its
URL one or more MongoDB ID which is not so simple to enumerate.
However, they each receive a 'tiny URL' in tabits domain, in the form
of https://tbit.be/{suffix} with suffix being a 5 character long
string containing numbers, lower and upper case letters. It is not so
simple to enumerate them all, but really easy to find some that work
and lead to a personal endpoint. Furthermore, the redirect URL
disclosed the MongoDB IDs discussed above, and we could use them to
query other endpoints disclosing more personal information.

An issue was discovered in Keyfactor PrimeKey EJBCA before 7.9.0,
related to possible inconsistencies in DNS identifiers submitted in an
ACME order and the corresponding CSR submitted during finalization.
During the ACME enrollment process, an order is submitted containing
an identifier for one or multiple dnsNames. These are validated
properly in the ACME challenge. However, if the validation passes, a
non-compliant client can include additional dnsNames the CSR sent to
the finalize endpoint, resulting in EJBCA issuing a certificate
including the identifiers that were not validated. This occurs even if
the certificate profile is configured to not allow a DN override by
the CSR.

affected installations of Parallels Desktop 17.1.1 (51537). An
attacker must first obtain the ability to execute high-privileged code
on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability. The
specific flaw exists within the ACPI virtual device. The issue results
from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can
result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can
leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute
arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. Was ZDI-CAN-16554.

Webswing before 22.1.3 allows X-Forwarded-For header injection. The
client IP address is associated with a variable in the configuration
page. The {clientIp} variable can be used as an application startup
argument. The X-Forwarded-For header can be manipulated by a client to
store an arbitrary value that is used to replace the clientIp variable
(without sanitization). A client can thus inject multiple arguments
into the session startup. Systems that do not use the clientIP
variable in the configuration are not vulnerable. The vulnerability is
fixed in these versions: 20.1.16, 20.2.19, 21.1.8, 21.2.12, and

A security vulnerability has been identified in Apache Kafka. It
affects all releases since 2.8.0. The vulnerability allows malicious
unauthenticated clients to allocate large amounts of memory on
brokers. This can lead to brokers hitting OutOfMemoryException and
causing denial of service. Example scenarios: - Kafka cluster without
authentication: Any clients able to establish a network connection to
a broker can trigger the issue. - Kafka cluster with SASL
authentication: Any clients able to establish a network connection to
a broker, without the need for valid SASL credentials, can trigger the
issue. - Kafka cluster with TLS authentication: Only clients able to
successfully authenticate via TLS can trigger the issue. We advise the
users to upgrade the Kafka installations to one of the 3.2.3, 3.1.2,
3.0.2, 2.8.2 versions.

curl can be told to parse a `.netrc` file for credentials. If that
file endsin a line with 4095 consecutive non-white space letters and
no newline, curlwould first read past the end of the stack-based
buffer, and if the readworks, write a zero byte beyond its
boundary.This will in most cases cause a segfault or similar, but
circumstances might also cause different outcomes.If a malicious user
can provide a custom netrc file to an application or otherwise affect
its contents, this flaw could be used as denial-of-service.

A response-header CRLF injection vulnerability in the Proxmox Virtual
Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) web interface allows
a remote attacker to set cookies for a victim's browser that are
longer than the server expects, causing a client-side DoS. This

Proxmox Virtual Environment (PVE) and Proxmox Mail Gateway (PMG) are
vulnerable to SSRF when proxying HTTP requests between pve(pmg)proxy
and pve(pmg)daemon. An attacker with an unprivileged account can craft
an HTTP request to achieve SSRF and file disclosure of any files on
the server. Also, in Proxmox Mail Gateway, privilege escalation to the
root@pam account is possible if the backup feature has ever been used,
because backup files such as pmg-backup_YYYY_MM_DD_*.tgz have 0644
permissions and contain an authkey value. This is fixed in pve-http-
server 4.1-3.

On Linksys E5350 WiFi Router with firmware version 1.0.00.037 and
lower, (and potentially other vendors/devices due to code reuse), the
/SysInfo.htm URI does not require a session ID. This web page calls a
show_sysinfo function which retrieves WPA passwords, SSIDs, MAC
Addresses, serial numbers, WPS Pins, and hardware/firmware versions,
and prints this information into the web page. This web page is
visible when remote management is enabled. A user who has access to
the web interface of the device can extract these secrets. If the
device has remote management enabled and is connected directly to the
internet, this vulnerability is exploitable over the internet without
interaction.

A flaw was found in pesign. The pesign package provides a systemd
service used to start the pesign daemon. This service unit runs a
script to set ACLs for /etc/pki/pesign and /run/pesign directories to
grant access privileges to users in the 'pesign' group. However, the
script doesn't check for symbolic links. This could allow an attacker
to gain access to privileged files and directories via a path

The ImageMagick Engine plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
deserialization of untrusted input via the 'cli_path' parameter in
versions up to, and including 1.7.5. This makes it possible for
unauthenticated users to call files using a PHAR wrapper, granted they
can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as
clicking on a link, that will deserialize and call arbitrary PHP
Objects that can be used to perform a variety of malicious actions
granted a POP chain is also present. It also requires that the
attacker is successful in uploading a file with the serialized
payload.

Reference: MISC:https://github.com/dotCMS/patches-hotfixes/tree/master/com.dotcms.security.matrixparams
Reference: MISC:https://www.dotcms.com/security/SI-63

dotCMS before 22.06 allows remote attackers to bypass intended access
control and obtain sensitive information by using a semicolon in a URL
to introduce a matrix parameter. (This is also fixed in 5.3.8.12,
21.06.9, and 22.03.2 for LTS users.) Some Java application frameworks,
including those used by Spring or Tomcat, allow the use of matrix
parameters: these are URI parameters separated by semicolons. Through
precise semicolon placement in a URI, it is possible to exploit this
feature to avoid dotCMS's path-based XSS prevention (such as "require
login" filters), and consequently access restricted resources. For
example, an attacker could place a semicolon immediately before a /
character that separates elements of a filesystem path. This could
reveal file content that is ordinarily only visible to signed-in
users. This issue can be chained with other exploit code to achieve
XSS attacks against dotCMS.

Apache CloudStack version 4.5.0 and later has a SAML 2.0
authentication Service Provider plugin which is found to be vulnerable
to XML external entity (XXE) injection. This plugin is not enabled by
default and the attacker would require that this plugin be enabled to
exploit the vulnerability. When the SAML 2.0 plugin is enabled in
affected versions of Apache CloudStack could potentially allow the
exploitation of XXE vulnerabilities. The SAML 2.0 messages constructed
during the authentication flow in Apache CloudStack are XML-based and
the XML data is parsed by various standard libraries that are now
understood to be vulnerable to XXE injection attacks such as arbitrary
file reading, possible denial of service, server-side request forgery
(SSRF) on the CloudStack management server.

An out-of-bounds memory write flaw was found in the Linux kernel&#8217;s
Kid-friendly Wired Controller driver. This flaw allows a local user to
crash or potentially escalate their privileges on the system. It is in
bigben_probe of drivers/hid/hid-bigbenff.c. The reason is incorrect
assumption - bigben devices all have inputs. However, malicious
devices can break this assumption, leaking to out-of-bound write.

Solana Pay is a protocol and set of reference implementations that
enable developers to incorporate decentralized payments into their
apps and services. When a Solana Pay transaction is located using a
reference key, it may be checked to represent a transfer of the
desired amount to the recipient, using the supplied `validateTransfer`
function. An edge case regarding this mechanism could cause the
validation logic to validate multiple transfers. This issue has been
patched as of version `0.2.1`. Users of the Solana Pay SDK should
upgrade to it. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

Streamlit is a data oriented application development framework for
python. Users hosting Streamlit app(s) that use custom components are
vulnerable to a directory traversal attack that could leak data from
their web server file-system such as: server logs, world readable
files, and potentially other sensitive information. An attacker can
craft a malicious URL with file paths and the streamlit server would
process that URL and return the contents of that file. This issue has
been resolved in version 1.11.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There
are no known workarounds for this issue.

Rust-WebSocket is a WebSocket (RFC6455) library written in Rust. In
versions prior to 0.26.5 untrusted websocket connections can cause an
out-of-memory (OOM) process abort in a client or a server. The root
cause of the issue is during dataframe parsing. Affected versions
would allocate a buffer based on the declared dataframe size, which
may come from an untrusted source. When `Vec::with_capacity` fails to
allocate, the default Rust allocator will abort the current process,
killing all threads. This affects only sync (non-Tokio)
implementation. Async version also does not limit memory, but does not
use `with_capacity`, so DoS can happen only when bytes for oversized
dataframe or message actually got delivered by the attacker. The
crashes are fixed in version 0.26.5 by imposing default dataframe size
limits. Affected users are advised to update to this version. Users
unable to upgrade are advised to filter websocket traffic externally
or to only accept trusted traffic.

NextAuth.js is a complete open source authentication solution for
Next.js applications. `next-auth` users who are using the
`EmailProvider` either in versions before `4.10.3` or `3.29.10` are
affected. If an attacker could forge a request that sent a comma-
separated list of emails (eg.:
`attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`) to the sign-in endpoint,
NextAuth.js would send emails to both the attacker and the victim's
e-mail addresses. The attacker could then login as a newly created
user with the email being `attacker@attacker.com,victim@victim.com`.
This means that basic authorization like
`email.endsWith("@victim.com")` in the `signIn` callback would fail to
communicate a threat to the developer and would let the attacker
bypass authorization, even with an `@attacker.com` address. This
vulnerability has been patched in `v4.10.3` and `v3.29.10` by
normalizing the email value that is sent to the sign-in endpoint
before accessing it anywhere else. We also added a
`normalizeIdentifier` callback on the `EmailProvider` configuration,
where you can further tweak your requirements for what your system
considers a valid e-mail address. (E.g.: strict RFC2821 compliance).
Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability. If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can
normalize the incoming request using Advanced Initialization.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT
devices. Because of insufficient validation of IPv6 neighbor discovery
options in Contiki-NG, attackers can send neighbor solicitation
packets that trigger an out-of-bounds read. The problem exists in the
module os/net/ipv6/uip-nd6.c, where memory read operations from the
main packet buffer, <code>uip_buf</code>, are not checked if they go
out of bounds. In particular, this problem can occur when attempting
to read the 2-byte option header and the Source Link-Layer Address
Option (SLLAO). This attack requires ipv6 be enabled for the network.
The problem has been patched in the develop branch of Contiki-NG. The
upcoming 4.8 release of Contiki-NG will include the patch.Users unable
to upgrade may apply the patch in Contiki-NG PR #1654.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT
devices. In the RPL-Classic routing protocol implementation in the
Contiki-NG operating system, an incoming DODAG Information Option
(DIO) control message can contain a prefix information option with a
length parameter. The value of the length parameter is not validated,
however, and it is possible to cause a buffer overflow when copying
the prefix in the set_ip_from_prefix function. This vulnerability
affects anyone running a Contiki-NG version prior to 4.7 that can
receive RPL DIO messages from external parties. To obtain a patched
version, users should upgrade to Contiki-NG 4.7 or later. There are no
workarounds for this issue.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The
implementation of tf.reshape op in TensorFlow is vulnerable to a
denial of service via CHECK-failure (assertion failure) caused by
overflowing the number of elements in a tensor. This issue has been
patched in GitHub commit 61f0f9b94df8c0411f0ad0ecc2fec2d3f3c33555. The
fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick
this commit on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow
2.7.2, as these are also affected and still in supported range. There
are no known workarounds for this issue.

Ethermint is an Ethereum library. In Ethermint running versions before
`v0.17.2`, the contract `selfdestruct` invocation permanently removes
the corresponding bytecode from the internal database storage.
However, due to a bug in the `DeleteAccount`function, all contracts
that used the identical bytecode (i.e shared the same `CodeHash`) will
also stop working once one contract invokes `selfdestruct`, even
though the other contracts did not invoke the `selfdestruct` OPCODE.
This vulnerability has been patched in Ethermint version v0.18.0. The
patch has state machine-breaking changes for applications using
Ethermint, so a coordinated upgrade procedure is required. A
workaround is available. If a contract is subject to DoS due to this
issue, the user can redeploy the same contract, i.e. with identical
bytecode, so that the original contract's code is recovered. The new
contract deployment restores the `bytecode hash -> bytecode` entry in
the internal state.

Improper input validation on the `contains` LoopBack filter may allow
for arbitrary SQL injection. When the extended filter property
`contains` is permitted to be interpreted by the Postgres connector,
it is possible to inject arbitrary SQL which may affect the
confidentiality and integrity of data stored on the connected
database. A patch was released in version 5.5.1. This affects users
who does any of the following: - Connect to the database via the
DataSource with `allowExtendedProperties: true` setting OR - Uses the
connector's CRUD methods directly OR - Uses the connector's other
methods to interpret the LoopBack filter. Users who are unable to
upgrade should do the following if applicable: - Remove
`allowExtendedProperties: true` DataSource setting - Add
`allowExtendedProperties: false` DataSource setting - When passing
directly to the connector functions, manually sanitize the user input
for the `contains` LoopBack filter beforehand.

Shield is an authentication and authorization framework for
CodeIgniter 4. This vulnerability may allow [SameSite
Attackers](https://canitakeyoursubdomain.name/) to bypass the
[CodeIgniter4 CSRF protection](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguid
e/libraries/security.html) mechanism with CodeIgniter Shield. For this
attack to succeed, the attacker must have direct (or indirect, e.g.,
XSS) control over a subdomain site (e.g., `https://a.example.com/`) of
the target site (e.g., `http://example.com/`). Upgrade to
**CodeIgniter v4.2.3 or later** and **Shield v1.0.0-beta.2 or later**.
As a workaround: set `Config\Security::$csrfProtection` to
`'session,'`remove old session data right after login (immediately
after ID and password match) and regenerate CSRF token right after
login (immediately after ID and password match)

undici is an HTTP/1.1 client, written from scratch for
Node.js.`undici` is vulnerable to SSRF (Server-side Request Forgery)
when an application takes in **user input** into the `path/pathname`
option of `undici.request`. If a user specifies a URL such as
`http://127.0.0.1` or `//127.0.0.1` ```js const undici =
require("undici") undici.request({origin: "http://example.com",
pathname: "//127.0.0.1"}) ``` Instead of processing the request as
`http://example.org//127.0.0.1` (or
`http://example.org/http://127.0.0.1` when `http://127.0.0.1 is
used`), it actually processes the request as `http://127.0.0.1/` and
sends it to `http://127.0.0.1`. If a developer passes in user input
into `path` parameter of `undici.request`, it can result in an _SSRF_
as they will assume that the hostname cannot change, when in actual
fact it can change because the specified path parameter is combined
with the base URL. This issue was fixed in `undici@5.8.1`. The best
workaround is to validate user input before passing it to the

Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. Versions 7.0.0
and above, prior to 7.0.5 are vulnerable to an Integer Overflow.
Executing an `XAUTOCLAIM` command on a stream key in a specific state,
with a specially crafted `COUNT` argument may cause an integer
overflow, a subsequent heap overflow, and potentially lead to remote
code execution. This has been patched in Redis version 7.0.5. No known
workarounds exist.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. The
`UnbatchGradOp` function takes an argument `id` that is assumed to be
a scalar. A nonscalar `id` can trigger a `CHECK` failure and crash the
program. It also requires its argument `batch_index` to contain three
times the number of elements as indicated in its
`batch_index.dim_size(0)`. An incorrect `batch_index` can trigger a
`CHECK` failure and crash the program. We have patched the issue in
GitHub commit 5f945fc6409a3c1e90d6970c9292f805f6e6ddf2. The fix will
be included in TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
on TensorFlow 2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these
are also affected and still in supported range. There are no known

The GitHub Actions ToolKit provides a set of packages to make creating
actions easier. The `core.exportVariable` function uses a well known
delimiter that attackers can use to break out of that specific
variable and assign values to other arbitrary variables. Workflows
that write untrusted values to the `GITHUB_ENV` file may cause the
path or other environment variables to be modified without the
intention of the workflow or action author. Users should upgrade to
`@actions/core v1.9.1`. If you are unable to upgrade the
`@actions/core` package, you can modify your action to ensure that any
user input does not contain the delimiter
`_GitHubActionsFileCommandDelimeter_` before calling
`core.exportVariable`.

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for secure smart contract
development. The functions `ECDSA.recover` and `ECDSA.tryRecover` are
vulnerable to a kind of signature malleability due to accepting
EIP-2098 compact signatures in addition to the traditional 65 byte
signature format. This is only an issue for the functions that take a
single `bytes` argument, and not the functions that take `r, v, s` or
`r, vs` as separate arguments. The potentially affected contracts are
those that implement signature reuse or replay protection by marking
the signature itself as used rather than the signed message or a nonce
included in it. A user may take a signature that has already been
submitted, submit it again in a different form, and bypass this
protection. The issue has been patched in 4.7.3.

TensorFlow is an open source platform for machine learning. If
`QuantizedInstanceNorm` is given `x_min` or `x_max` tensors of a
nonzero rank, it results in a segfault that can be used to trigger a
denial of service attack. We have patched the issue in GitHub commit
785d67a78a1d533759fcd2f5e8d6ef778de849e0. The fix will be included in
TensorFlow 2.10.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow
2.9.1, TensorFlow 2.8.1, and TensorFlow 2.7.2, as these are also
affected and still in supported range. There are no known workarounds

The GitOps Tools Extension for VSCode can make it easier to manage
Flux objects. A specially crafted Flux object may allow for remote
code execution in the machine running the extension, in the context of
the user that is running VSCode. Users using the VSCode extension to
manage clusters that are shared amongst other users are affected by
this issue. The only safe mitigation is to update to the latest
version of the extension.

The GitOps Tools Extension for VSCode relies on kubeconfigs in order
to communicate with Kubernetes clusters. A specially crafted
kubeconfig leads to arbitrary code execution on behalf of the user
running VSCode. Users relying on kubeconfigs that are generated or
altered by other processes or users are affected by this issue. Please
note that the vulnerability is specific to this extension, and the
same kubeconfig would not result in arbitrary code execution when used
with kubectl. Using only trust-worthy kubeconfigs is a safe
mitigation. However, updating to the latest version of the extension
is still highly recommended.

OpenSearch Security is a plugin for OpenSearch that offers encryption,
authentication and authorization. Versions 2.0.0.0 and 2.1.0.0 of the
security plugin are affected by an information disclosure
vulnerability. Requests to an OpenSearch cluster configured with
advanced access control features document level security (DLS), field
level security (FLS), and/or field masking will not be filtered when
the query's search pattern matches an aliased index. OpenSearch
Dashboards creates an alias to `.kibana` by default, so filters with
the index pattern of `*` to restrict access to documents or fields
will not be applied. This issue allows requests to access sensitive
information when customer have acted to restrict access that specific
information. OpenSearch 2.2.0, which is compatible with OpenSearch
Security 2.2.0.0, contains the fix for this issue. There is no
recommended work around.

Arvados is an open source platform for managing, processing, and
sharing genomic and other large scientific and biomedical data. A
remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Arvados Workbench
allows authenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code via specially
crafted JSON payloads. This exists in all versions up to 2.4.1 and is
fixed in 2.4.2. This vulnerability is specific to the Ruby on Rails
Workbench application (&#8220;Workbench 1&#8221;). We do not believe any other
Arvados components, including the TypesScript browser-based Workbench
application (&#8220;Workbench 2&#8221;) or API Server, are vulnerable to this
attack. For versions of Arvados earlier than 2.4.2: remove the Ruby-
based "Workbench 1" app ("apt-get remove arvados-workbench") from your
installation as a workaround.

Venice is a Clojure inspired sandboxed Lisp dialect with excellent
Java interoperability. A partial path traversal issue exists within
the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be
limited to load files from a list of load paths. Assuming Venice has
been configured with the load paths: `[ "/Users/foo/resources" ]` When
passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions
everything is fine: `(load-resource "test.png")` => loads the file
"/Users/foo/resources/test.png" `(load-resource "../resources-
alt/test.png")` => rejected, outside the load path When passing
**absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return
files outside the configured load paths: `(load-resource
"/Users/foo/resources/test.png")` => loads the file
"/Users/foo/resources/test.png" `(load-resource "/Users/foo/resources-
alt/test.png")` => loads the file "/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png"
!!! The latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_
vulnerability. This issue&#8217;s scope is limited to absolute paths whose
name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path
`"/Users/foo/resources"`, the actor can cause loading a resource also
from `"/Users/foo/resources-alt"`, but not from `"/Users/foo/images"`.
Versions of Venice before and including v1.10.17 are affected by this
issue. Upgrade to Venice >= 1.10.18, if you are on a version <
1.10.18. There are currently no known workarounds.

Frontier is Substrate's Ethereum compatibility layer. A security issue
was discovered affecting parsing of the RPC result of the exit reason
in case of EVM reversion. In release build, this would cause the exit
reason being incorrectly parsed and returned by RPC. In debug build,
this would cause an overflow panic. No action is needed unless you
have a bridge node that needs to distinguish different reversion exit
reasons and you used RPC for this. There are currently no known
workarounds.

gomatrixserverlib is a Go library for matrix protocol federation.
Dendrite is a Matrix homeserver written in Go, an alternative to
Synapse. The power level parsing within gomatrixserverlib was failing
to parse the `"events_default"` key of the `m.room.power_levels`
event, defaulting the event default power level to zero in all cases.
Power levels are the matrix terminology for user access level. In
rooms where the `"events_default"` power level had been changed, this
could result in events either being incorrectly authorised or rejected
by Dendrite servers. gomatrixserverlib contains a fix as of commit
`723fd49` and Dendrite 0.9.3 has been updated accordingly. Matrix
rooms where the `"events_default"` power level has not been changed
from the default of zero are not vulnerable. Users are advised to
upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this issue.

This library allows strings to be parsed as functions and stored as a
specialized component, [`JsonFunctionValue`](https://github.com/oxyno-
zeta/react-editable-json-tree/blob/09a0ca97835b0834ad054563e2fddc6f22b
c5d8c/src/components/JsonFunctionValue.js). To do this, Javascript's
[`eval`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval) function is used
to execute strings that begin with "function" as Javascript. This
unfortunately could allow arbitrary code to be executed if it exists
as a value within the JSON structure being displayed. Given that this
component may often be used to display data from arbitrary, untrusted
sources, this is extremely dangerous. One important note is that users
who have defined a custom
[`onSubmitValueParser`](https://github.com/oxyno-zeta/react-editable-
json-tree/tree/09a0ca97835b0834ad054563e2fddc6f22bc5d8c#onsubmitvaluep
arser) callback prop on the [`JsonTree`](https://github.com/oxyno-
zeta/react-editable-json-
tree/blob/09a0ca97835b0834ad054563e2fddc6f22bc5d8c/src/JsonTree.js)
component should be ***unaffected***. This vulnerability exists in the
default `onSubmitValueParser` prop which calls
[`parse`](https://github.com/oxyno-zeta/react-editable-json-
tree/blob/master/src/utils/parse.js#L30). Prop is added to `JsonTree`
called `allowFunctionEvaluation`. This prop will be set to `true` in
v2.2.2, which allows upgrade without losing backwards-compatibility.
In v2.2.2, we switched from using `eval` to using
[`Function`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function) to construct
anonymous functions. This is better than `eval` for the following
reasons: - Arbitrary code should not be able to execute immediately,
since the `Function` constructor explicitly *only creates* anonymous
functions - Functions are created without local closures, so they only
have access to the global scope If you use: - **Version `<2.2.2`**,
you must upgrade as soon as possible. - **Version `^2.2.2`**, you must
explicitly set `JsonTree`'s `allowFunctionEvaluation` prop to `false`
to fully mitigate this vulnerability. - **Version `>=3.0.0`**,
`allowFunctionEvaluation` is already set to `false` by default, so no
further steps are necessary.

A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to
have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to
continue certificate verification despite failure to construct a path
to a trusted issuer. An attacker can craft a malicious email address
to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer
overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or
potentially remote code execution. Many platforms implement stack
overflow protections which would mitigate against the risk of remote
code execution. The risk may be further mitigated based on stack
layout for any given platform/compiler. Pre-announcements of
CVE-2022-3602 described this issue as CRITICAL. Further analysis based
on some of the mitigating factors described above have led this to be
downgraded to HIGH. Users are still encouraged to upgrade to a new
version as soon as possible. In a TLS client, this can be triggered by
connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be
triggered if the server requests client authentication and a malicious
client connects. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.7 (Affected
3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2,3.0.3,3.0.4,3.0.5,3.0.6).

The typo3/html-sanitizer package is an HTML sanitizer, written in PHP,
aiming to provide XSS-safe markup based on explicitly allowed tags,
attributes and values. Due to a parsing issue in the upstream package
`masterminds/html5`, malicious markup used in a sequence with special
HTML comments cannot be filtered and sanitized. This allows for a
bypass of the cross-site scripting mechanism of `typo3/html-
sanitizer`. This issue has been addressed in versions 1.0.7 and 2.0.16
of the `typo3/html-sanitizer` package. Users are advised to upgrade.

Besu is a Java-based Ethereum client. In versions newer than 22.1.3
and prior to 22.7.1, Besu is subject to an Incorrect Conversion
between Numeric Types. An error in 32 bit signed and unsigned types in
the calculation of available gas in the CALL operations (including
DELEGATECALL) results in incorrect gas being passed into called
contracts and incorrect gas being returned after call execution. Where
the amount of gas makes a difference in the success or failure, or if
the gas is a negative 64 bit value, the execution will result in a
different state root than expected, resulting in a consensus failure
in networks with multiple EVM implementations. In networks with a
single EVM implementation this can be used to execute with
significantly more gas than then transaction requested, possibly
exceeding gas limitations. This issue is patched in version 22.7.1. As
a workaround, reverting to version 22.1.3 or earlier will prevent
incorrect execution.

ReactPHP HTTP is a streaming HTTP client and server implementation for
ReactPHP. In ReactPHP's HTTP server component versions starting with
0.7.0 and prior to 1.7.0, when ReactPHP is processing incoming HTTP
cookie values, the cookie names are url-decoded. This may lead to
cookies with prefixes like `__Host-` and `__Secure-` confused with
cookies that decode to such prefix, thus leading to an attacker being
able to forge cookie which is supposed to be secure. This issue is
fixed in ReactPHP HTTP version 1.7.0. As a workaround, Infrastructure
or DevOps can place a reverse proxy in front of the ReactPHP HTTP
server to filter out any unexpected `Cookie` request headers.

jsoup is a Java HTML parser, built for HTML editing, cleaning,

sanitize HTML including `javascript:` URL expressions, which could
allow XSS attacks when a reader subsequently clicks that link. If the
non-default `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks` option is enabled, HTML
including `javascript:` URLs that have been crafted with control
characters will not be sanitized. If the site that this HTML is
published on does not set a Content Security Policy, an XSS attack is
then possible. This issue is patched in jsoup 1.15.3. Users should
upgrade to this version. Additionally, as the unsanitized input may
have been persisted, old content should be cleaned again using the
updated version. To remediate this issue without immediately
upgrading: - disable `SafeList.preserveRelativeLinks`, which will
rewrite input URLs as absolute URLs - ensure an appropriate [Content
Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-

Flux is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources of
configuration (like Git repositories), and automating updates to
configuration when there is new code to deploy. Flux CLI allows users
to deploy Flux components into a Kubernetes cluster via command-line.
The vulnerability allows other applications to replace the Flux
deployment information with arbitrary content which is deployed into
the target Kubernetes cluster instead. The vulnerability is due to the
improper handling of user-supplied input, which results in a path
traversal that can be controlled by the attacker. Users sharing the
same shell between other applications and the Flux CLI commands could
be affected by this vulnerability. In some scenarios no errors may be
presented, which may cause end users not to realize that something is
amiss. A safe workaround is to execute Flux CLI in ephemeral and
isolated shell environments, which can ensure no persistent values
exist from previous processes. However, upgrading to the latest
version of the CLI is still the recommended mitigation strategy.

kirby is a content management system (CMS) that adapts to many
different projects and helps you build your own ideal interface.
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability that allows
execution of any kind of JavaScript code inside the Panel session of
the same or other users. In the Panel, a harmful script can for
example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the
victim. If bad actors gain access to your group of authenticated Panel
users they can escalate their privileges via the Panel session of an
admin user. Depending on your site, other JavaScript-powered attacks
are possible. The multiselect field allows selection of tags from an
autocompleted list. Unfortunately, the Panel in Kirby 3.5 used HTML
rendering for the raw option value. This allowed **attackers with
influence on the options source** to store HTML code. The browser of
the victim who visited a page with manipulated multiselect options in
the Panel will then have rendered this malicious HTML code when the
victim opened the autocomplete dropdown. Users are *not* affected by

NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis,
MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. It utilizes web sockets for instant
interactions and real-time notifications. `utils.generateUUID`, a
helper function available in essentially all versions of NodeBB (as
far back as v1.0.1 and potentially earlier) used a cryptographically
insecure Pseudo-random number generator (`Math.random()`), which meant
that a specially crafted script combined with multiple invocations of
the password reset functionality could enable an attacker to correctly
calculate the reset code for an account they do not have access to.
This vulnerability impacts all installations of NodeBB. The
vulnerability allows for an attacker to take over any account without
the involvement of the victim, and as such, the remediation should be
applied immediately (either via NodeBB upgrade or cherry-pick of the
specific changeset. The vulnerability has been patched in version 2.x
and 1.19.x. There is no known workaround, but the patch sets listed
above will fully patch the vulnerability.

Flux2 is a tool for keeping Kubernetes clusters in sync with sources

that allows one to declaratively manage Helm chart releases. Helm
controller is tightly integrated with the Helm SDK. A vulnerability
found in the Helm SDK that affects flux2 v0.0.17 until v0.32.0 and
helm-controller v0.0.4 until v0.23.0 allows for specific data inputs
to cause high memory consumption. In some platforms, this could cause
the controller to panic and stop processing reconciliations. In a
shared cluster multi-tenancy environment, a tenant could create a
HelmRelease that makes the controller panic, denying all other tenants
from their Helm releases being reconciled. Patches are available in
flux2 v0.32.0 and helm-controller v0.23.0.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
Next-Generation IoT devices. The 6LoWPAN implementation in Contiki-NG
may cast a UDP header structure at a certain offset in a packet
buffer. The code does not check whether the packet buffer is large
enough to fit a full UDP header structure from the offset where the
casting is made. Hence, it is possible to cause an out-of-bounds read
beyond the packet buffer. The problem affects anyone running devices
with Contiki-NG versions previous to 4.8, and which may receive
6LoWPAN packets from external parties. The problem has been patched in
Contiki-NG version 4.8.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
Next-Generation IoT devices. The low-power IPv6 network stack of
Contiki-NG has a buffer module (os/net/ipv6/uipbuf.c) that processes
IPv6 extension headers in incoming data packets. As part of this
processing, the function uipbuf_get_next_header casts a pointer to a
uip_ext_hdr structure into the packet buffer at different offsets
where extension headers are expected to be found, and then reads from
this structure. Because of a lack of bounds checking, the casting can
be done so that the structure extends beyond the packet's end. Hence,
with a carefully crafted packet, it is possible to cause the Contiki-
NG system to read data outside the packet buffer. A patch that fixes
the vulnerability is included in Contiki-NG 4.8.

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for
Next-Generation IoT devices. The 6LoWPAN implementation in the
Contiki-NG operating system (file os/net/ipv6/sicslowpan.c) contains
an input function that processes incoming packets and copies them into
a packet buffer. Because of a missing length check in the input
function, it is possible to write outside the packet buffer's
boundary. The vulnerability can be exploited by anyone who has the
possibility to send 6LoWPAN packets to a Contiki-NG system. In
particular, the vulnerability is exposed when sending either of two
types of 6LoWPAN packets: an unfragmented packet or the first fragment
of a fragmented packet. If the packet is sufficiently large, a
subsequent memory copy will cause an out-of-bounds write with data
supplied by the attacker.

Helm is a tool for managing Charts. Charts are packages of pre-
configured Kubernetes resources. Fuzz testing, provided by the CNCF,
identified input to functions in the _strvals_ package that can cause
an out of memory panic. The _strvals_ package contains a parser that
turns strings in to Go structures. The _strvals_ package converts
these strings into structures Go can work with. Some string inputs can
cause array data structures to be created causing an out of memory
panic. Applications that use the _strvals_ package in the Helm SDK to
parse user supplied input can suffer a Denial of Service when that
input causes a panic that cannot be recovered from. The Helm Client
will panic with input to `--set`, `--set-string`, and other value
setting flags that causes an out of memory panic. Helm is not a long
running service so the panic will not affect future uses of the Helm
client. This issue has been resolved in 3.9.4. SDK users can validate
strings supplied by users won't create large arrays causing
significant memory usage before passing them to the _strvals_
functions.

Cosign is a project under the sigstore organization which aims to make
signatures invisible infrastructure. In versions prior to 1.12.0 a
number of vulnerabilities have been found in cosign verify-blob, where
Cosign would successfully verify an artifact when verification should
have failed. First a cosign bundle can be crafted to successfully
verify a blob even if the embedded rekorBundle does not reference the
given signature. Second, when providing identity flags, the email and
issuer of a certificate is not checked when verifying a Rekor bundle,
and the GitHub Actions identity is never checked. Third, providing an
invalid Rekor bundle without the experimental flag results in a
successful verification. And fourth an invalid transparency log entry
will result in immediate success for verification. Details and
examples of these issues can be seen in the GHSA-8gw7-4j42-w388

matrix-js-sdk is a Matrix messaging protocol Client-Server SDK for
JavaScript. In versions prior to 19.4.0 events sent with special
strings in key places can temporarily disrupt or impede the matrix-js-
sdk from functioning properly, potentially impacting the consumer's
ability to process data safely. Note that the matrix-js-sdk can appear
to be operating normally but be excluding or corrupting runtime data
presented to the consumer. This issue has been fixed in matrix-js-sdk
19.4.0 and users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may
mitigate this issue by redacting applicable events, waiting for the
sync processor to store data, and restarting the client.
Alternatively, redacting the applicable events and clearing all
storage will often fix most perceived issues. In some cases, no
workarounds are possible.

Elrond go is the go implementation for the Elrond Network protocol. In
versions prior to 1.3.35, read only calls between contracts can
generate smart contracts results. For example, if contract A calls in
read only mode contract B and the called function will make changes
upon the contract's B state, the state will be altered for contract B
as if the call was not made in the read-only mode. This can lead to
some effects not designed by the original smart contracts programmers.
This issue was patched in version 1.3.35. There are no known
workarounds.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
In versions prior to 8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6, Grafana is subject to
Improper Preservation of Permissions resulting in privilege escalation
on some folders where Admin is the only used permission. The
vulnerability impacts Grafana instances where RBAC was disabled and
enabled afterwards, as the migrations which are translating legacy
folder permissions to RBAC permissions do not account for the scenario
where the only user permission in the folder is Admin, as a result
RBAC adds permissions for Editors and Viewers which allow them to edit
and view folders accordingly. This issue has been patched in versions
8.5.13, 9.0.9, and 9.1.6. A workaround when the impacted
folder/dashboard is known is to remove the additional permissions
manually.

Azure RTOS USBx is a USB host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) embedded
stack, fully integrated with Azure RTOS ThreadX and available for all
Azure RTOS ThreadX&#8211;supported processors. Azure RTOS USBX
implementation of host support for USB CDC ECM includes an integer
underflow and a buffer overflow in the
`_ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_mac_address_get` function which may be
potentially exploited to achieve remote code execution or denial of
service. Setting mac address string descriptor length to a `0` or `1`
allows an attacker to introduce an integer underflow followed
(string_length) by a buffer overflow of the `cdc_ecm ->
ux_host_class_cdc_ecm_node_id` array. This may allow one to redirect
the code execution flow or introduce a denial of service. The fix has
been included in USBX release [6.1.12](https://github.com/azure-
rtos/usbx/releases/tag/v6.1.12_rel). Improved mac address string
descriptor length validation to check for unexpectedly small values
may be used as a workaround.

Shescape is a shell escape package for JavaScript. An Inefficient
Regular Expression Complexity vulnerability impacts users that use
Shescape to escape arguments for the Unix shells `Bash` and `Dash`, or
any not-officially-supported Unix shell; and/or using the `escape` or
`escapeAll` functions with the `interpolation` option set to `true`.
An attacker can cause polynomial backtracking or quadratic runtime in
terms of the input string length due to two Regular Expressions in
Shescape that are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service
(ReDoS). This bug has been patched in v1.5.10. For `Dash` only, this
bug has been patched since v1.5.9. As a workaround, a maximum length
can be enforced on input strings to Shescape to reduce the impact of
the vulnerability. It is not recommended to try and detect vulnerable
input strings, as the logic for this may end up being vulnerable to
ReDoS itself.

2022-08-29, attackers can register new accounts and upload files to
arbitrary directories within the container. If the attacker uploads a
Python script to the right location, they can execute arbitrary code
within the container. To be affected, ALL of the following must be
true: Self-hosted deployment (GrowthBook Cloud is unaffected); using
local file uploads (as opposed to S3 or Google Cloud Storage);
NODE_ENV set to a non-production value and JWT_SECRET set to an easily
guessable string like `dev`. This issue is patched in commit
1a5edff8786d141161bf880c2fd9ccbe2850a264 (2022-08-29). As a
workaround, set `JWT_SECRET` environment variable to a long random
string. This will stop arbitrary file uploads, but the only way to
stop attackers from registering accounts is by updating to the latest
build.

Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. When handling dependencies
that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Poetry uses
various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are constructed
using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the
commands, Poetry correctly avoids Command Injection vulnerabilities by
passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However,
there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`)
and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a
positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the
commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary
executables. If a developer is exploited, the attacker could steal
credentials or persist their access. If the exploit happens on a
server, the attackers could use their access to attack other internal
systems. Since this vulnerability requires a fair amount of user
interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely exploitable one.
However, it still puts developers at risk when dealing with untrusted
files in a way they think is safe, because the exploit still works
when the victim tries to make sure nothing can happen, e.g. by vetting
any Git or Poetry config files that might be present in the directory.
Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this issue.

Poetry is a dependency manager for Python. To handle dependencies that
come from a Git repository, Poetry executes various commands, e.g.
`git config`. These commands are being executed using the executable&#8217;s
name and not its absolute path. This can lead to the execution of
untrusted code due to the way Windows resolves executable names to
paths. Unlike Linux-based operating systems, Windows searches for the
executable in the current directory first and looks in the paths that
are defined in the `PATH` environment variable afterward. This
vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which would lead
to the takeover of the system. If a developer is exploited, the
attacker could steal credentials or persist their access. If the
exploit happens on a server, the attackers could use their access to
attack other internal systems. Since this vulnerability requires a
fair amount of user interaction, it is not as dangerous as a remotely
exploitable one. However, it still puts developers at risk when
dealing with untrusted files in a way they think is safe. The victim
could also not protect themself by vetting any Git or Poetry config
files that might be present in the directory, because the behavior is
undocumented. Versions 1.1.9 and 1.2.0b1 contain patches for this

SFTPGo is configurable SFTP server with optional HTTP/S, FTP/S and
WebDAV support. SFTPGo WebAdmin and WebClient support login using TOTP
(Time-based One Time Passwords) as a secondary authentication factor.
Because TOTPs are often configured on mobile devices that can be lost,
stolen or damaged, SFTPGo also supports recovery codes. These are a
set of one time use codes that can be used instead of the TOTP. In
SFTPGo versions from version 2.2.0 to 2.3.3 recovery codes can be
generated before enabling two-factor authentication. An attacker who
knows the user's password could potentially generate some recovery
codes and then bypass two-factor authentication after it is enabled on
the account at a later time. This issue has been fixed in version
2.3.4. Recovery codes can now only be generated after enabling two-
factor authentication and are deleted after disabling it.

NodeBB Forum Software is powered by Node.js and supports either Redis,
MongoDB, or a PostgreSQL database. Due to an unnecessarily strict
conditional in the code handling the first step of the SSO process,
the pre-existing logic that added (and later checked) a nonce was
inadvertently rendered opt-in instead of opt-out. This re-exposed a
vulnerability in that a specially crafted Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
attack could theoretically take over another user account during the
single sign-on process. The issue has been fully patched in version
1.17.2.

The Electron framework enables writing cross-platform desktop
applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. In versions prior to
21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7, Electron is vulnerable to
Exposure of Sensitive Information. When following a redirect, Electron
delays a check for redirecting to file:// URLs from other schemes. The
contents of the file is not available to the renderer following the
redirect, but if the redirect target is a SMB URL such as
`file://some.website.com/`, then in some cases, Windows will connect
to that server and attempt NTLM authentication, which can include
sending hashed credentials.This issue has been patched in versions:
21.0.0-beta.1, 20.0.1, 19.0.11, and 18.3.7. Users are recommended to
upgrade to the latest stable version of Electron. If upgrading isn't
possible, this issue can be addressed without upgrading by preventing
redirects to file:// URLs in the `WebContents.on('will-redirect')`
event, for all WebContents as a workaround.

Binary provides encoding/decoding in Borsh and other formats. The
vulnerability is a memory allocation vulnerability that can be
exploited to allocate slices in memory with (arbitrary) excessive size
value, which can either exhaust available memory or crash the whole
program. When using `github.com/gagliardetto/binary` to parse
unchecked (or wrong type of) data from untrusted sources of input
(e.g. the blockchain) into slices, it's possible to allocate memory
with excessive size. When `dec.Decode(&val)` method is used to parse
data into a structure that is or contains slices of values, the length
of the slice was previously read directly from the data itself without
any checks on the size of it, and then a slice was allocated. This
could lead to an overflow and an allocation of memory with excessive
size value. Users should upgrade to `v0.7.1` or higher. A workaround
is not to rely on the `dec.Decode(&val)` function to parse the data,
but to use a custom `UnmarshalWithDecoder()` method that reads and
checks the length of any slice.

Parse Server is an open source backend that can be deployed to any
infrastructure that can run Node.js. Internal fields (keys used
internally by Parse Server, prefixed by `_`) and protected fields
(user defined) can be used as query constraints. Internal and
protected fields are removed by Parse Server and are only returned to
the client using a valid master key. However, using query constraints,
these fields can be guessed by enumerating until Parse Server, prior
to versions 4.10.14 or 5.2.5, returns a response object. The patch
available in versions 4.10.14 and 5.2.5 requires the maser key to use
internal and protected fields as query constraints. As a workaround,
implement a Parse Cloud Trigger `beforeFind` and manually remove the
query constraints.

JOSE is "JSON Web Almost Everything" - JWA, JWS, JWE, JWT, JWK, JWKS
with no dependencies using runtime's native crypto in Node.js,
Browser, Cloudflare Workers, Electron, and Deno. The PBKDF2-based JWE
key management algorithms expect a JOSE Header Parameter named `p2c`
PBES2 Count, which determines how many PBKDF2 iterations must be
executed in order to derive a CEK wrapping key. The purpose of this
parameter is to intentionally slow down the key derivation function in
order to make password brute-force and dictionary attacks more
expensive. This makes the PBES2 algorithms unsuitable for situations
where the JWE is coming from an untrusted source: an adversary can
intentionally pick an extremely high PBES2 Count value, that will
initiate a CPU-bound computation that may take an unreasonable amount
of time to finish. Under certain conditions, it is possible to have
the user's environment consume unreasonable amount of CPU time. The
impact is limited only to users utilizing the JWE decryption APIs with
symmetric secrets to decrypt JWEs from untrusted parties who do not
limit the accepted JWE Key Management Algorithms (`alg` Header
Parameter) using the `keyManagementAlgorithms` (or `algorithms` in
v1.x) decryption option or through other means. The `v1.28.2`,
`v2.0.6`, `v3.20.4`, and `v4.9.2` releases limit the maximum PBKDF2
iteration count to `10000` by default. It is possible to adjust this
limit with a newly introduced `maxPBES2Count` decryption option. If
users are unable to upgrade their required library version, they have
two options depending on whether they expect to receive JWEs using any
of the three PBKDF2-based JWE key management algorithms. They can use
the `keyManagementAlgorithms` decryption option to disable accepting
PBKDF2 altogether, or they can inspect the JOSE Header prior to using
the decryption API and limit the PBKDF2 iteration count (`p2c` Header
Parameter).

cruddl is software for creating a GraphQL API for a database, using
the GraphQL SDL to model a schema. If cruddl starting with version
1.1.0 and prior to versions 2.7.0 and 3.0.2 is used to generate a
schema that uses `@flexSearchFulltext`, users of that schema may be
able to inject arbitrary AQL queries that will be forwarded to and
executed by ArangoDB. Schemas that do not use `@flexSearchFulltext`
are not affected. The attacker needs to have `READ` permission to at
least one root entity type that has `@flexSearchFulltext` enabled. The
issue has been fixed in version 3.0.2 and in version 2.7.0 of cruddl.
As a workaround, users can temporarily remove `@flexSearchFulltext`
from their schemas.

Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open source, general-purpose policy
engine. The Rego compiler provides a (deprecated) `WithUnsafeBuiltins`
function, which allows users to provide a set of built-in functions
that should be deemed unsafe &#8212; and as such rejected &#8212; by the compiler
if encountered in the policy compilation stage. A bypass of this
protection has been found, where the use of the `with` keyword to mock
such a built-in function (a feature introduced in OPA v0.40.0), isn&#8217;t
taken into account by `WithUnsafeBuiltins`. Multiple conditions need
to be met in order to create an adverse effect. Version 0.43.1
contains a patch for this issue. As a workaround, avoid using the
`WithUnsafeBuiltins` function and use the `capabilities` feature
instead.

linked_list_allocator is an allocator usable for no_std systems. Prior
to version 0.10.2, the heap initialization methods were missing a
minimum size check for the given heap size argument. This could lead
to out-of-bound writes when a heap was initialized with a size smaller
than `3 * size_of::<usize>` because of metadata write operations. This
vulnerability impacts all the initialization functions on the `Heap`
and `LockedHeap` types, including `Heap::new`, `Heap::init`,
`Heap::init_from_slice`, and `LockedHeap::new`. It also affects
multiple uses of the `Heap::extend` method. Version 0.10.2 contains a
patch for the issue. As a workaround, ensure that the heap is only
initialized with a size larger than `3 * size_of::<usize>` and that
the `Heap::extend` method is only called with sizes larger than `2 *
size_of::<usize>()`. Also, ensure that the total heap size is (and
stays) a multiple of `2 * size_of::<usize>()`.

XWiki Platform Old Core is a core package for XWiki Platform, a
generic wiki platform. Prior to versions 13.1.0.5 and 14.3-rc-1, some
resources are missing a check for inactive (not yet activated or

some resources handler created by extensions are not protected by
default, so an inactive user could perform actions for such
extensions. This issue has existed since at least version 1.1 of XWiki
for instance configured with the email activation required for new
users. Now it's more critical for versions 11.3-rc-1 and later since
the maintainers provided the capability to disable user without
deleting them and encouraged using that feature. XWiki 14.3-rc-1 and
XWiki 13.10.5 contain a patch. There is no workaround for this other
than upgrading XWiki.

XWiki Platform Web Templates are templates for XWiki Platform, a
generic wiki platform. Through the suggestion feature, string and list
properties of objects the user shouldn't have access to can be
accessed in versions prior to 13.10.4 and 14.2. This includes private
personal information like email addresses and salted password hashes
of registered users but also other information stored in properties of
objects. Sensitive configuration fields like passwords for LDAP or
SMTP servers could be accessed. By exploiting an additional
vulnerability, this issue can even be exploited on private wikis at
least for string properties. The issue is patched in version 13.10.4
and 14.2. Password properties are no longer displayed and rights are
checked for other properties. A workaround is available. The template
file `suggest.vm` can be replaced by a patched version without
upgrading or restarting XWiki unless it has been overridden, in which
case the overridden template should be patched, too. This might need
adjustments for older versions, though.

XWiki Platform Old Core is a core package for XWiki Platform, a
generic wiki platform. Prior to versions 14.2 and 13.10.4, all rights
checks that would normally prevent a user from viewing a document on a
wiki can be bypassed using the login action and directly specified
templates. This exposes title, content and comments of any document
and properties of objects, though class and property name must be
known. This is also exploitable on private wikis. This has been
patched in versions 14.2 and 13.10.4 by properly checking view rights
before loading documents and disallowing non-default templates in the
login, registration and skin action. As a workaround, it would be
possible to protect all templates individually by adding code to check
access rights first.

XWiki Platform Web Templates are templates for XWiki Platform, a
generic wiki platform. By passing a template of the distribution
wizard to the xpart template, user accounts can be created even when
user registration is disabled. This also circumvents any email
verification. Before versions 14.2 and 13.10.4, this can also be
exploited on a private wiki, thus potentially giving the attacker
access to the wiki. Depending on the configured default rights of
users, this could also give attackers write access to an otherwise
read-only public wiki. Users can also be created when an external
authentication system like LDAP is configured, but authentication
fails unless the authentication system supports a bypass/local
accounts are enabled in addition to the external authentication
system. This issue has been patched in XWiki 13.10.5 and 14.3RC1. As a
workaround, one may replace `xpart.vm`, the entry point for this
attack, by a patched version from the patch without updating XWiki.

XWiki Platform Wiki UI Main Wiki is software for managing subwikis on
XWiki Platform, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version
5.3-milestone-2 and prior to versions 13.10.6 and 14.4, it's possible
to inject arbitrary wiki syntax including Groovy, Python and Velocity
script macros via the request (URL parameter) using the
`XWikiServerClassSheet` if the user has view access to this sheet and
another page that has been saved with programming rights, a standard
condition on a public read-only XWiki installation or a private XWiki
installation where the user has an account. This allows arbitrary
Groovy/Python/Velocity code execution which allows bypassing all
rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content
stored in the XWiki installation. Also, this could be used to impact
the availability of the wiki. This has been patched in versions
13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, edit the affected document
`XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` or `WikiManager.XWikiServerClassSheet`
and manually perform the changes from the patch fixing the issue. On
XWiki versions 12.0 and later, it is also possible to import the
document `XWiki.XWikiServerClassSheet` from the xwiki-platform-wiki-
ui-mainwiki package version 14.4 using the import feature of the
administration application as there have been no other changes to this
document since XWiki 12.0.

XWiki Platform Applications Tag and XWiki Platform Tag UI are tag
applications for XWiki, a generic wiki platform. Starting with version
1.7 in XWiki Platform Applications Tag and prior to 13.10.6 and 14.4
in XWiki Platform Tag UI, the tags document `Main.Tags` in XWiki
didn't sanitize user inputs properly. This allowed users with view
rights on the document (default in a public wiki or for authenticated
users on private wikis) to execute arbitrary Groovy, Python and
Velocity code with programming rights. This also allowed bypassing all
rights checks and thus both modification and disclosure of all content
stored in the XWiki installation. The vulnerability could be used to
impact the availability of the wiki. On XWiki versions before 13.10.4
and 14.2, this can be combined with CVE-2022-36092, meaning that no
rights are required to perform the attack. The vulnerability has been
patched in versions 13.10.6 and 14.4. As a workaround, the patch that
fixes the issue can be manually applied to the document `Main.Tags` or
the updated version of that document can be imported from version 14.4
of xwiki-platform-tag-ui using the import feature in the
administration UI on XWiki 10.9 and later.

Talos Linux is a Linux distribution built for Kubernetes deployments.
Talos worker nodes use a join token to get accepted into the Talos
cluster. Due to improper validation of the request while signing a
worker node CSR (certificate signing request) Talos control plane node
might issue Talos API certificate which allows full access to Talos
API on a control plane node. Accessing Talos API with full level
access on a control plane node might reveal sensitive information
which allows full level access to the cluster (Kubernetes and Talos
PKI, etc.). Talos API join token is stored in the machine
configuration on the worker node. When configured correctly,
Kubernetes workloads don't have access to the machine configuration,
but due to a misconfiguration workload might access the machine
configuration and reveal the join token. This problem has been fixed
in Talos 1.2.2. Enabling the Pod Security Standards mitigates the
vulnerability by denying hostPath mounts and host networking by
default in the baseline policy. Clusters that don't run untrusted
workloads are not affected. Clusters with correct Pod Security
configurations which don't allow hostPath mounts, and secure access to
cloud metadata server (or machine configuration is not supplied via
cloud metadata server) are not affected.

Moby is an open-source project created by Docker to enable software
containerization. A bug was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where
supplementary groups are not set up properly. If an attacker has
direct access to a container and manipulates their supplementary group
access, they may be able to use supplementary group access to bypass
primary group restrictions in some cases, potentially gaining access
to sensitive information or gaining the ability to execute code in
that container. This bug is fixed in Moby (Docker Engine) 20.10.18.
Running containers should be stopped and restarted for the permissions
to be fixed. For users unable to upgrade, this problem can be worked
around by not using the `"USER $USERNAME"` Dockerfile instruction.
Instead by calling `ENTRYPOINT ["su", "-", "user"]` the supplementary
groups will be set up properly.

immudb is a database with built-in cryptographic proof and
verification. In versions prior to 1.4.1, a malicious immudb server
can provide a falsified proof that will be accepted by the client SDK
signing a falsified transaction replacing the genuine one. This
situation can not be triggered by a genuine immudb server and requires
the client to perform a specific list of verified operations resulting
in acceptance of an invalid state value. This vulnerability only
affects immudb client SDKs, the immudb server itself is not affected
by this vulnerability. This issue has been patched in version 1.4.1.

Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. After a
package is downloaded, Cargo extracts its source code in the ~/.cargo
folder on disk, making it available to the Rust projects it builds. To
record when an extraction is successful, Cargo writes "ok" to the
.cargo-ok file at the root of the extracted source code once it
extracted all the files. It was discovered that Cargo allowed packages
to contain a .cargo-ok symbolic link, which Cargo would extract. Then,
when Cargo attempted to write "ok" into .cargo-ok, it would actually
replace the first two bytes of the file the symlink pointed to with
ok. This would allow an attacker to corrupt one file on the machine
using Cargo to extract the package. Note that by design Cargo allows
code execution at build time, due to build scripts and procedural
macros. The vulnerabilities in this advisory allow performing a subset
of the possible damage in a harder to track down way. Your
dependencies must still be trusted if you want to be protected from
attacks, as it's possible to perform the same attacks with build
scripts and procedural macros. The vulnerability is present in all
versions of Cargo. Rust 1.64, to be released on September 22nd, will
include a fix for it. Since the vulnerability is just a more limited
way to accomplish what a malicious build scripts or procedural macros
can do, we decided not to publish Rust point releases backporting the
security fix. Patch files are available for Rust 1.63.0 are available
in the wg-security-response repository for people building their own
toolchain. Mitigations We recommend users of alternate registries to
exercise care in which package they download, by only including
trusted dependencies in their projects. Please note that even with
these vulnerabilities fixed, by design Cargo allows arbitrary code
execution at build time thanks to build scripts and procedural macros:
a malicious dependency will be able to cause damage regardless of
these vulnerabilities. crates.io implemented server-side checks to
reject these kinds of packages years ago, and there are no packages on
crates.io exploiting these vulnerabilities. crates.io users still need
to exercise care in choosing their dependencies though, as remote code
execution is allowed by design there as well.

Cargo is a package manager for the rust programming language. It was
discovered that Cargo did not limit the amount of data extracted from
compressed archives. An attacker could upload to an alternate registry

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20220728 CVE-2022-36364: Apache Calcite Avatica JDBC driver `httpclient_impl` connection property can be used as an RCE vector
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/07/28/1

Apache Calcite Avatica JDBC driver creates HTTP client instances based
on class names provided via `httpclient_impl` connection property;
however, the driver does not verify if the class implements the
expected interface before instantiating it, which can lead to code
execution loaded via arbitrary classes and in rare cases remote code
execution. To exploit the vulnerability: 1) the attacker needs to have
privileges to control JDBC connection parameters; 2) and there should
be a vulnerable class (constructor with URL parameter and ability to
execute code) in the classpath. From Apache Calcite Avatica 1.22.0
onwards, it will be verified that the class implements the expected
interface before invoking its constructor.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/12/07/2

Guests can trigger NIC interface reset/abort/crash via netback It is
possible for a guest to trigger a NIC interface reset/abort/crash in a
Linux based network backend by sending certain kinds of packets. It
appears to be an (unwritten?) assumption in the rest of the Linux
network stack that packet protocol headers are all contained within
the linear section of the SKB and some NICs behave badly if this is
not the case. This has been reported to occur with Cisco (enic) and
Broadcom NetXtrem II BCM5780 (bnx2x) though it may be an issue with
other NICs/drivers as well. In case the frontend is sending requests
with split headers, netback will forward those violating above
mentioned assumption to the networking core, resulting in said
misbehavior.
