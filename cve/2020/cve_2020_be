Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20221019 ISIS-3128: CVE-2022-42467: Apache Isis: h2 webconsole (available only in prototype mode) should nevertheless be disabled by default.
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/19/1

When running in prototype mode, the h2 webconsole module (accessible
from the Prototype menu) is automatically made available with the
ability to directly query the database. It was felt that it is safer
to require the developer to explicitly enable this capability. As of
2.0.0-M8, this can now be done using the
'isis.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access' configuration
property; the web console will be unavailable without setting this
configuration. As an additional safeguard, the new
'isis.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password'
configuration parameter (enabled by default) requires that the
administrator use a randomly generated password to use the console.
The password is printed to the log, as "webAdminPass: xxx" (where
"xxx") is the password. To revert to the original behaviour, the
administrator would therefore need to set these configuration
parameter: isis.prototyping.h2-console.web-allow-remote-access=true
isis.prototyping.h2-console.generate-random-web-admin-password=false
Note also that the h2 webconsole is never available in production
mode, so these safeguards are only to ensure that the webconsole is
secured by default also in prototype mode.

Rapid7 Nexpose and InsightVM versions prior to 6.6.172 failed to
reliably validate the authenticity of update contents. This failure
could allow an attacker to provide a malicious update and alter the
functionality of Rapid7 Nexpose. The attacker would need some pre-
existing mechanism to provide a malicious update, either through a
social engineering effort, privileged access to replace downloaded
updates in transit, or by performing an Attacker-in-the-Middle attack
on the update service itself.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/10/18/1

Apache Commons Text performs variable interpolation, allowing
properties to be dynamically evaluated and expanded. The standard
format for interpolation is "${prefix:name}", where "prefix" is used
to locate an instance of org.apache.commons.text.lookup.StringLookup
that performs the interpolation. Starting with version 1.5 and
continuing through 1.9, the set of default Lookup instances included
interpolators that could result in arbitrary code execution or contact
with remote servers. These lookups are: - "script" - execute
expressions using the JVM script execution engine (javax.script) -
"dns" - resolve dns records - "url" - load values from urls, including
from remote servers Applications using the interpolation defaults in
the affected versions may be vulnerable to remote code execution or
unintentional contact with remote servers if untrusted configuration
values are used. Users are recommended to upgrade to Apache Commons
Text 1.10.0, which disables the problematic interpolators by default.

In wolfSSL before 5.5.2, if callback functions are enabled (via the
WOLFSSL_CALLBACKS flag), then a malicious TLS 1.3 client or network
attacker can trigger a buffer over-read on the heap of 5 bytes.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/01/msg00017.html

powerline-gitstatus (aka Powerline Gitstatus) before 1.3.2 allows
arbitrary code execution. git repositories can contain per-repository
configuration that changes the behavior of git, including running
arbitrary commands. When using powerline-gitstatus, changing to a
directory automatically runs git commands in order to display
information about the current repository in the prompt. If an attacker
can convince a user to change their current directory to one
controlled by the attacker, such as in a shared filesystem or
extracted archive, powerline-gitstatus will run arbitrary commands
under the attacker's control. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2022-20001.

curl before 7.86.0 has a double free. If curl is told to use an HTTP
proxy for a transfer with a non-HTTP(S) URL, it sets up the connection
to the remote server by issuing a CONNECT request to the proxy, and
then tunnels the rest of the protocol through. An HTTP proxy might
refuse this request (HTTP proxies often only allow outgoing
connections to specific port numbers, like 443 for HTTPS) and instead
return a non-200 status code to the client. Due to flaws in the
error/cleanup handling, this could trigger a double free in curl if
one of the following schemes were used in the URL for the transfer:
dict, gopher, gophers, ldap, ldaps, rtmp, rtmps, or telnet. The
earliest affected version is 7.77.0.

In curl before 7.86.0, the HSTS check could be bypassed to trick it
into staying with HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed
to use HTTPS directly (instead of using an insecure cleartext HTTP
step) even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This mechanism could be
bypassed if the host name in the given URL uses IDN characters that
get replaced with ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion,
e.g., using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC FULL STOP) instead
of the common ASCII full stop of U+002E (.). The earliest affected
version is 7.77.0 2021-05-26.

Python 3.9.x before 3.9.16 and 3.10.x before 3.10.9 on Linux allows
local privilege escalation in a non-default configuration. The Python
multiprocessing library, when used with the forkserver start method on
Linux, allows pickles to be deserialized from any user in the same
machine local network namespace, which in many system configurations
means any user on the same machine. Pickles can execute arbitrary
code. Thus, this allows for local user privilege escalation to the
user that any forkserver process is running as. Setting
multiprocessing.util.abstract_sockets_supported to False is a
workaround. The forkserver start method for multiprocessing is not the
default start method. This issue is Linux specific because only Linux
supports abstract namespace sockets. CPython before 3.9 does not make
use of Linux abstract namespace sockets by default. Support for users
manually specifying an abstract namespace socket was added as a bugfix
in 3.7.8 and 3.8.3, but users would need to make specific uncommon API
calls in order to do that in CPython before 3.9.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/07/2

Apache Commons BCEL has a number of APIs that would normally only
allow changing specific class characteristics. However, due to an out-
of-bounds writing issue, these APIs can be used to produce arbitrary
bytecode. This could be abused in applications that pass attacker-
controllable data to those APIs, giving the attacker more control over
the resulting bytecode than otherwise expected. Update to Apache
Commons BCEL 6.6.0.

Name: CVE-2022-4304

Reference: GENTOO:GLSA-202402-08

Reference: MISC:OpenSSL Advisory
Reference: URL:https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt

A timing based side channel exists in the OpenSSL RSA Decryption
implementation which could be sufficient to recover a plaintext across
a network in a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful
decryption an attacker would have to be able to send a very large
number of trial messages for decryption. The vulnerability affects all
RSA padding modes: PKCS#1 v1.5, RSA-OEAP and RSASVE. For example, in a
TLS connection, RSA is commonly used by a client to send an encrypted
pre-master secret to the server. An attacker that had observed a
genuine connection between a client and a server could use this flaw
to send trial messages to the server and record the time taken to
process them. After a sufficiently large number of messages the
attacker could recover the pre-master secret used for the original
connection and thus be able to decrypt the application data sent over
that connection.

KDDI +Message App, NTT DOCOMO +Message App, and SoftBank +Message App
contain a vulnerability caused by improper handling of Unicode control
characters. +Message App displays text unprocessed, even when control
characters are contained, and the text is shown based on Unicode
control character's specifications. Therefore, a crafted text may
display misleading web links. As a result, a spoofed URL may be
displayed and phishing attacks may be conducted. Affected products and
versions are as follows: KDDI +Message App for Android prior to
version 3.9.2 and +Message App for iOS prior to version 3.9.4, NTT
DOCOMO +Message App for Android prior to version 54.49.0500 and
+Message App for iOS prior to version 3.9.4, and SoftBank +Message App

A vulnerability exists in curl <7.87.0 HSTS check that could be
bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP. Using its HSTS support, curl
can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text
HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. However, the HSTS
mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL first
uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of
the IDN conversion. Like using the character UTF-8 U+3002 (IDEOGRAPHIC
FULL STOP) instead of the common ASCII full stop (U+002E) `.`. Then in
a subsequent request, it does not detect the HSTS state and makes a
clear text transfer. Because it would store the info IDN encoded but
look for it IDN decoded.

WAN interface by default on these devices. While there are firewall
restrictions in place that define access restrictions for IPv4
traffic, these restrictions do not appear to be applied to the WAN
interface for IPv6. This allows arbitrary access to any services
running on the device that may be inadvertently listening via IPv6,

The Linux kernel NFSD implementation prior to versions 5.19.17 and
6.0.2 are vulnerable to buffer overflow. NFSD tracks the number of
pages held by each NFSD thread by combining the receive and send
buffers of a remote procedure call (RPC) into a single array of pages.
A client can force the send buffer to shrink by sending an RPC message
over TCP with garbage data added at the end of the message. The RPC
message with garbage data is still correctly formed according to the
specification and is passed forward to handlers. Vulnerable code in
NFSD is not expecting the oversized request and writes beyond the
allocated buffer space. CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

The function PEM_read_bio_ex() reads a PEM file from a BIO and parses
and decodes the "name" (e.g. "CERTIFICATE"), any header data and the
payload data. If the function succeeds then the "name_out", "header"
and "data" arguments are populated with pointers to buffers containing
the relevant decoded data. The caller is responsible for freeing those
buffers. It is possible to construct a PEM file that results in 0
bytes of payload data. In this case PEM_read_bio_ex() will return a
failure code but will populate the header argument with a pointer to a
buffer that has already been freed. If the caller also frees this
buffer then a double free will occur. This will most likely lead to a
crash. This could be exploited by an attacker who has the ability to
supply malicious PEM files for parsing to achieve a denial of service
attack. The functions PEM_read_bio() and PEM_read() are simple
wrappers around PEM_read_bio_ex() and therefore these functions are
also directly affected. These functions are also called indirectly by
a number of other OpenSSL functions including
PEM_X509_INFO_read_bio_ex() and SSL_CTX_use_serverinfo_file() which
are also vulnerable. Some OpenSSL internal uses of these functions are
not vulnerable because the caller does not free the header argument if
PEM_read_bio_ex() returns a failure code. These locations include the
PEM_read_bio_TYPE() functions as well as the decoders introduced in
OpenSSL 3.0. The OpenSSL asn1parse command line application is also
impacted by this issue.

A directory traversal vulnerability in the ZIP archive extraction
routines of KNIME Server since 4.3.0 can result in arbitrary files
being overwritten on the server's file system. This vulnerability is
also known as 'Zip-Slip'. An attacker can create a KNIME workflow
that, when being uploaded, can overwrite arbitrary files that the
operating system user running the KNIME Server process has write
access to. The user must be authenticated and have permissions to
upload files to KNIME Server. This can impact data integrity (file
contents are changed) or cause errors in other software (vital files
being corrupted). It can even lead to remote code execution if
executable files are being replaced and subsequently executed by the
KNIME Server process user. In all cases the attacker has to know the
location of files on the server's file system, though. Note that users
that have permissions to upload workflows usually also have
permissions to run them on the KNIME Server and can therefore already
execute arbitrary code in the context of the KNIME Executor's
operating system user. There is no workaround to prevent this
vulnerability from being exploited. Updates to fixed versions 4.13.6,
4.14.3, or 4.15.3 are advised.

A directory traversal vulnerability in the ZIP archive extraction
routines of KNIME Analytics Platform 3.2.0 and above can result in
arbitrary files being overwritten on the user's system. This
vulnerability is also known as 'Zip-Slip'. An attacker can create a
KNIME workflow that, when being opened by a user, can overwrite
arbitrary files that the user has write access to. It's not necessary
to execute the workflow, opening the workflow is sufficient. The user
will notice that something is wrong because an error is being reported
but only after the files have already been written. This can impact
data integrity (file contents are changed) or cause errors in other
software (vital files being corrupted). It can even lead to remote
code execution if executable files are being replaced and subsequently
executed by the user. In all cases the attacker has to know the
location of files on the user's system, though.

Name: CVE-2022-44784
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://members.backbox.org/maggioli-appalti-contratti-multiple-vulnerabilities/

An issue was discovered in Appalti & Contratti 9.12.2. The target web
applications LFS and DL229 expose a set of services provided by the
Axis 1.4 instance, embedded directly into the applications, as hinted
by the WEB-INF/web.xml file leaked through Local File Inclusion. Among
the exposed services, there is the Axis AdminService, which, through
the default configuration, should normally be accessible only by the
localhost. Nevertheless, by trying to access the mentioned service,
both in LFS and DL229, the service can actually be reached even by
remote users, allowing creation of arbitrary services on the server
side. When an attacker can reach the AdminService, they can use it to
instantiate arbitrary services on the server. The exploit procedure is
well known and described in Generic AXIS-SSRF exploitation. Basically,
the attack consists of writing a JSP page inside the root directory of
the web application, through the org.apache.axis.handlers.LogHandler
class.

An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712.
Management protocol has a flow which allows a remote attacker to
execute arbitrary Bash code with root privileges. The command that
sets the hostname doesn't validate input parameters. As a result,
arbitrary data goes directly to the Bash interpreter. An attacker

An issue was discovered in Object First Ootbi BETA build 1.0.7.712. A
flaw was found in the Web Service, which could lead to local
information disclosure. The command that creates the URL for the

the generated URL. As a result, an attacker can get access to system
logs. An attacker would need credentials to exploit this
vulnerability. This is fixed in Object First Ootbi BETA build
1.0.13.1611. Important note - This vulnerability is related to the
Object First Ootbi BETA version, which is not released for production
and therefore has no impact on the production environment. The

Multiple Xiongmai NVR devices, including MBD6304T
V4.02.R11.00000117.10001.131900.00000 and NBD6808T-PL
V4.02.R11.C7431119.12001.130000.00000, allow authenticated users to
execute arbitrary commands as root, as exploited in the wild starting
in approximately 2019. A remote and authenticated attacker, possibly
using the default admin:tlJwpbo6 credentials, can connect to port
34567 and execute arbitrary operating system commands via a crafted
JSON file during an upgrade request. Since at least 2021, Xiongmai has
applied patches to prevent attackers from using this mechanism to
execute telnetd.

An HTTP Request Forgery issue was discovered in Varnish Cache 5.x and
6.x before 6.0.11, 7.x before 7.1.2, and 7.2.x before 7.2.1. An
attacker may introduce characters through HTTP/2 pseudo-headers that
are invalid in the context of an HTTP/1 request line, causing the
Varnish server to produce invalid HTTP/1 requests to the backend. This
could, in turn, be used to exploit vulnerabilities in a server behind
the Varnish server. Note: the 6.0.x LTS series (before 6.0.11) is
affected.

An issue was discovered in Python before 3.11.1. An unnecessary
quadratic algorithm exists in one path when processing some inputs to
the IDNA (RFC 3490) decoder, such that a crafted, unreasonably long
name being presented to the decoder could lead to a CPU denial of
service. Hostnames are often supplied by remote servers that could be
controlled by a malicious actor; in such a scenario, they could
trigger excessive CPU consumption on the client attempting to make use
of an attacker-supplied supposed hostname. For example, the attack
payload could be placed in the Location header of an HTTP response
with status code 302. A fix is planned in 3.11.1, 3.10.9, 3.9.16,
3.8.16, and 3.7.16.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/11/10/5

xterm before 375 allows code execution via font ops, e.g., because an
OSC 50 response may have Ctrl-g and therefore lead to command
execution within the vi line-editing mode of Zsh. NOTE: font ops are
not allowed in the xterm default configurations of some Linux
distributions.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/04/18/6

The SlingRequestDispatcher doesn't correctly implement the
RequestDispatcher API resulting in a generic type of include-based
cross-site scripting issues on the Apache Sling level. The
vulnerability is exploitable by an attacker that is able to include a
resource with specific content-type and control the include path (i.e.
writing content). The impact of a successful attack is privilege
escalation to administrative power. Please update to Apache Sling
Engine >= 2.14.0 and enable the "Check Content-Type overrides"
configuration option.

The fix for CVE-2022-3437 included changing memcmp to be constant time
and a workaround for a compiler bug by adding "!= 0" comparisons to
the result of memcmp. When these patches were backported to the
heimdal-7.7.1 and heimdal-7.8.0 branches (and possibly other branches)
a logic inversion sneaked in causing the validation of message
integrity codes in gssapi/arcfour to be inverted.

Cross-Site Tracing occurs when a server will echo a request back via
the Trace method, allowing an XSS attack to access to authorization
headers and cookies inaccessible to JavaScript (such as cookies
protected by HTTPOnly). To mitigate this attack, browsers placed
limits on <code>fetch()</code> and XMLHttpRequest; however some
webservers have implemented non-standard headers such as <code>X-Http-
Method-Override</code> that override the HTTP method, and made this
attack possible again. Thunderbird has applied the same mitigations to
the use of this and similar headers. This vulnerability affects
Firefox ESR < 102.5, Thunderbird < 102.5, and Firefox < 107.
