Status: Candidate
Reference: CONFIRM:https://kb.juniper.net/JSA11078
Reference: URL:https://kb.juniper.net/JSA11078

Receipt of a specifically malformed NDP packet sent from the local
area network (LAN) to a device running Juniper Networks Junos OS
Evolved can cause the ndp process to crash, resulting in a Denial of
Service (DoS). The process automatically restarts without
intervention, but a continuous receipt of the malformed NDP packets
could leaded to an extended Denial of Service condition. During this
time, IPv6 neighbor learning will be affected. The issue occurs when
parsing the incoming malformed NDP packet. Rather than simply
discarding the packet, the process asserts, performing a controlled
exit and restart, thereby avoiding any chance of an unhandled
exception. Exploitation of this vulnerability is limited to a
temporary denial of service, and cannot be leveraged to cause
additional impact on the system. This issue is limited to the
processing of IPv6 NDP packets. IPv4 packet processing cannot trigger,
and is unaffected by this vulnerability. This issue affects all
Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved versions prior to 20.1R2-EVO. Junos
OS is unaffected by this vulnerability.

When configuring stateless firewall filters in Juniper Networks EX4600
and QFX 5000 Series devices using Virtual Extensible LAN protocol
(VXLAN), the discard action will fail to discard traffic under certain
conditions. Given a firewall filter configuration similar to: family
ethernet-switching { filter L2-VLAN { term ALLOW { from { user-vlan-id
100; } then { accept; } } term NON-MATCH { then { discard; } } when
there is only one term containing a 'user-vlan-id' match condition,
and no other terms in the firewall filter except discard, the discard
action for non-matching traffic will only discard traffic with the
same VLAN ID specified under 'user-vlan-id'. Other traffic (e.g. VLAN
ID 200) will not be discarded. This unexpected behavior can lead to
unintended traffic passing through the interface where the firewall
filter is applied. This issue only affects systems using VXLANs. This
issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on QFX5K Series: 18.1 versions

<p>This vulnerability is caused when SharePoint Server does not
properly sanitize a specially crafted request to an affected
SharePoint server.</p> <p>An authenticated attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to an affected
SharePoint server. The attacker who successfully exploited this
vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting attacks on
affected systems and run script in the security context of the current
user. These attacks could allow the attacker to read content that the
attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity to take
actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the victim, such as change
permissions, delete content, steal sensitive information (such as
browser cookies) and inject malicious content in the browser of the
victim.</p> <p>For this vulnerability to be exploited, a user must
click a specially crafted URL that takes the user to a targeted
SharePoint Web App site.</p> <p>In an email attack scenario, an
attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending an email message
containing the specially crafted URL to the user of the targeted
SharePoint Web App site and convincing the user to click the specially
crafted URL.</p> <p>In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker would
have to host a website that contains a specially crafted URL to the
targeted SharePoint Web App site that is used to attempt to exploit
these vulnerabilities. In addition, compromised websites and websites
that accept or host user-provided content could contain specially
crafted content that could exploit the vulnerability. An attacker
would have no way to force users to visit a specially crafted website.
Instead, an attacker would have to convince them to visit the website,
typically by getting them to click a link in an instant messenger or
email message that takes them to the attacker's website, and then
convince them to click the specially crafted URL.</p> <p>The security
update addresses the vulnerability by helping to ensure that
SharePoint Server properly sanitizes user web requests.</p>

exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting
attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of
the current authenticated user. These attacks could allow the attacker
to read content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the
victim's identity to take actions within Dynamics Server on behalf of
the user, such as change permissions and delete content, and inject
malicious content in the browser of the user.</p> <p>The security

control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights.</p> <p>To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker
would need to convince a target to clone a repository and open it in
Visual Studio Code. Attacker-specified code would execute when the
target opens the malicious 'package.json' file.</p> <p>The update
address the vulnerability by modifying the way Visual Studio Code
handles JSON files.</p>

Windows Canonical Display Driver Information Disclosure Vulnerability

======================================================
Name: CVE-2020-1703
Status: Candidate

** REJECT ** DO NOT USE THIS CANDIDATE NUMBER. ConsultIDs: none.
Reason: This candidate was withdrawn by its CNA. Further investigation
showed that it was not a security issue. Notes: Red Hat Product
Security does not consider this as a security flaw. Password changes
aren't expected to invalidate existing sessions. Though this is how
Kerberos behaves: incrementing kvno will not invalidate any existing
service tickets. This is not a concern because the lifetime on service
tickets should be set appropriately (initially only a global, now also
more finely configurable with the kdcpolicy plugin). This belief is
reinforced by our use of mod_session: existing sessions there aren't
terminated, but instead wait for expiration.

An out-of-bounds heap buffer access flaw was found in the way the
iSCSI Block driver in QEMU versions 2.12.0 before 4.2.1 handled a
response coming from an iSCSI server while checking the status of a
Logical Address Block (LBA) in an iscsi_co_block_status() routine. A
remote user could use this flaw to crash the QEMU process, resulting
in a denial of service or potential execution of arbitrary code with
privileges of the QEMU process on the host.

A flaw was found in libssh versions before 0.8.9 and before 0.9.4 in
the way it handled AES-CTR (or DES ciphers if enabled) ciphers. The
server or client could crash when the connection hasn't been fully
initialized and the system tries to cleanup the ciphers when closing
the connection. The biggest threat from this vulnerability is system
availability.

A race condition flaw was found in Ansible Engine 2.7.17 and prior,
2.8.9 and prior, 2.9.6 and prior when running a playbook with an
unprivileged become user. When Ansible needs to run a module with
become user, the temporary directory is created in /var/tmp. This
directory is created with "umask 77 && mkdir -p <dir>"; this operation
does not fail if the directory already exists and is owned by another
user. An attacker could take advantage to gain control of the become
user as the target directory can be retrieved by iterating
'/proc/<pid>/cmdline'.

LilyPond before 2.24 allows attackers to bypass the -dsafe protection
mechanism via output-def-lookup or output-def-scope, as demonstrated
by dangerous Scheme code in a .ly file that causes arbitrary code

An issue was discovered in uIP 1.0, as used in Contiki 3.0 and other
products. When the Urgent flag is set in a TCP packet, and the stack
is configured to ignore the urgent data, the stack attempts to use the
value of the Urgent pointer bytes to separate the Urgent data from the
normal data, by calculating the offset at which the normal data should
be present in the global buffer. However, the length of this offset is
not checked; therefore, for large values of the Urgent pointer bytes,
the data pointer can point to memory that is way beyond the data
buffer in uip_process in uip.c.

WSO2 API Manager 3.1.0 and earlier has reflected XSS on the
"publisher" component's admin interface. More precisely, it is
possible to inject an XSS payload into the owner POST parameter, which
does not filter user inputs. By putting an XSS payload in place of a
valid Owner Name, a modal box appears that writes an error message
concatenated to the injected payload (without any form of data
encoding). This can also be exploited via CSRF.

faced with an incoming fragment that belongs to a non-empty fragment
list, IPv6 reassembly must check that there are no empty holes between
the fragments: this leads to an uninitialized pointer dereference in
_fnet_ip6_reassembly in fnet_ip6.c, and causes Denial-of-Service.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20210501 CVE-2021-28359: Apache Airflow Reflected XSS via Origin Query Argument in URL
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/01/2

The "origin" parameter passed to some of the endpoints like '/trigger'
was vulnerable to XSS exploit. This issue affects Apache Airflow
versions prior to 1.10.13. This is same as CVE-2020-13944 but the
implemented fix in Airflow 1.10.13 did not fix the issue completely.

The S3 buckets and keys in a secure Apache Ozone Cluster must be
inaccessible to anonymous access by default. The current security
vulnerability allows access to keys and buckets through a curl command
or an unauthenticated HTTP request. This enables unauthorized access
to buckets and keys thereby exposing data to anonymous clients or
users. This affected Apache Ozone prior to the 1.1.0 release.

Apache Flink 1.5.1 introduced a REST handler that allows you to write
an uploaded file to an arbitrary location on the local file system,
through a maliciously modified HTTP HEADER. The files can be written
to any location accessible by Flink 1.5.1. All users should upgrade to
Flink 1.11.3 or 1.12.0 if their Flink instance(s) are exposed. The
issue was fixed in commit a5264a6f41524afe8ceadf1d8ddc8c80f323ebc4
from apache/flink:master.

A change introduced in Apache Flink 1.11.0 (and released in 1.11.1 and
1.11.2 as well) allows attackers to read any file on the local
filesystem of the JobManager through the REST interface of the
JobManager process. Access is restricted to files accessible by the
JobManager process. All users should upgrade to Flink 1.11.3 or 1.12.0
if their Flink instance(s) are exposed. The issue was fixed in commit
b561010b0ee741543c3953306037f00d7a9f0801 from apache/flink:master.

A use-after-free vulnerability introduced in glibc upstream version
2.14 was found in the way the tilde expansion was carried out.
Directory paths containing an initial tilde followed by a valid
username were affected by this issue. A local attacker could exploit
this flaw by creating a specially crafted path that, when processed by
the glob function, would potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.
This was fixed in version 2.32.

Apache Groovy provides extension methods to aid with creating
temporary directories. Prior to this fix, Groovy's implementation of
those extension methods was using a now superseded Java JDK method
call that is potentially not secure on some operating systems in some
contexts. Users not using the extension methods mentioned in the
advisory are not affected, but may wish to read the advisory for
further details. Versions Affected: 2.0 to 2.4.20, 2.5.0 to 2.5.13,
3.0.0 to 3.0.6, and 4.0.0-alpha-1. Fixed in versions 2.4.21, 2.5.14,
3.0.7, 4.0.0-alpha-2.

When ORT (now via atstccfg) generates ip_allow.config files in Apache
Traffic Control 3.0.0 to 3.1.0 and 4.0.0 to 4.1.0, those files include
permissions that allow bad actors to push arbitrary content into and
remove arbitrary content from CDN cache servers. Additionally, these
permissions are potentially extended to IP addresses outside the
desired range, resulting in them being granted to clients possibly
outside the CDN arcitechture.

Subversion's mod_authz_svn module will crash if the server is using
in-repository authz rules with the AuthzSVNReposRelativeAccessFile
option and a client sends a request for a non-existing repository URL.
This can lead to disruption for users of the service. This issue was

While investigating bug 64830 it was discovered that Apache Tomcat
10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.0-M9, 9.0.0-M1 to 9.0.39 and 8.5.0 to 8.5.59 could
re-use an HTTP request header value from the previous stream received
on an HTTP/2 connection for the request associated with the subsequent
stream. While this would most likely lead to an error and the closure
of the HTTP/2 connection, it is possible that information could leak
between requests.

In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to
7.0.99 the HTTP header parsing code used an approach to end-of-line
parsing that allowed some invalid HTTP headers to be parsed as valid.
This led to a possibility of HTTP Request Smuggling if Tomcat was
located behind a reverse proxy that incorrectly handled the invalid
Transfer-Encoding header in a particular manner. Such a reverse proxy
is considered unlikely.

When using the Apache JServ Protocol (AJP), care must be taken when
trusting incoming connections to Apache Tomcat. Tomcat treats AJP
connections as having higher trust than, for example, a similar HTTP
connection. If such connections are available to an attacker, they can
be exploited in ways that may be surprising. In Apache Tomcat 9.0.0.M1
to 9.0.0.30, 8.5.0 to 8.5.50 and 7.0.0 to 7.0.99, Tomcat shipped with
an AJP Connector enabled by default that listened on all configured IP
addresses. It was expected (and recommended in the security guide)
that this Connector would be disabled if not required. This
vulnerability report identified a mechanism that allowed: - returning
arbitrary files from anywhere in the web application - processing any
file in the web application as a JSP Further, if the web application
allowed file upload and stored those files within the web application
(or the attacker was able to control the content of the web
application by some other means) then this, along with the ability to
process a file as a JSP, made remote code execution possible. It is
important to note that mitigation is only required if an AJP port is
accessible to untrusted users. Users wishing to take a defence-in-
depth approach and block the vector that permits returning arbitrary
files and execution as JSP may upgrade to Apache Tomcat 9.0.31, 8.5.51
or 7.0.100 or later. A number of changes were made to the default AJP
Connector configuration in 9.0.31 to harden the default configuration.
It is likely that users upgrading to 9.0.31, 8.5.51 or 7.0.100 or
later will need to make small changes to their configurations.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/01/28/1

The optional initial password change and password expiration features
present in Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.2.0 to 1.22.0 are prone to a
sensitive information disclosure vulnerability. The code mandates the
changed password to be passed as an additional attribute to the
credentials object but does not remove it upon processing during the
first phase of the authentication. In combination with additional,
independent authentication mechanisms, this may lead to the new
password being disclosed.

Apache Ant 1.1 to 1.9.14 and 1.10.0 to 1.10.7 uses the default
temporary directory identified by the Java system property
java.io.tmpdir for several tasks and may thus leak sensitive
information. The fixcrlf and replaceregexp tasks also copy files from
the temporary directory back into the build tree allowing an attacker
to inject modified source files into the build process.

Reference: MLIST:[camel-commits] 20200313 [camel] branch camel-3.1.x updated: Update Commons Configuration 2 due to CVE-2020-1953

Apache Commons Configuration uses a third-party library to parse YAML
files which by default allows the instantiation of classes if the YAML
includes special statements. Apache Commons Configuration versions
2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 2.6 did not change the default settings of this
library. So if a YAML file was loaded from an untrusted source, it
could therefore load and execute code out of the control of the host
application.

Apache CXF has the ability to integrate with JMX by registering an
InstrumentationManager extension with the CXF bus. If the
&#8216;createMBServerConnectorFactory&#8216; property of the default
InstrumentationManagerImpl is not disabled, then it is vulnerable to a
man-in-the-middle (MITM) style attack. An attacker on the same host
can connect to the registry and rebind the entry to another server,
thus acting as a proxy to the original. They are then able to gain
access to all of the information that is sent and received over JMX.

Name: CVE-2020-1955
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://docs.couchdb.org/en/master/cve/2020-1955.html

CouchDB version 3.0.0 shipped with a new configuration setting that
governs access control to the entire database server called
`require_valid_user_except_for_up`. It was meant as an extension to
the long standing setting `require_valid_user`, which in turn requires
that any and all requests to CouchDB will have to be made with valid
credentials, effectively forbidding any anonymous requests. The new
`require_valid_user_except_for_up` is an off-by-default setting that
was meant to allow requiring valid credentials for all endpoints
except for the `/_up` endpoint. However, the implementation of this
made an error that lead to not enforcing credentials on any endpoint,
when enabled. CouchDB versions 3.0.1[1] and 3.1.0[2] fix this issue.

When LDAP authentication is enabled in Apache Druid 0.17.0, callers of
Druid APIs with a valid set of LDAP credentials can bypass the
credentialsValidator.userSearch filter barrier that determines if a
valid LDAP user is allowed to authenticate with Druid. They are still
subject to role-based authorization checks, if configured. Callers of
Druid APIs can also retrieve any LDAP attribute values of users that
exist on the LDAP server, so long as that information is visible to
the Druid server. This information disclosure does not require the
caller itself to be a valid LDAP user.

Reference: MISC:http://syncope.apache.org/security

A Server-Side Template Injection was identified in Apache Syncope
prior to 2.1.6 enabling attackers to inject arbitrary Java EL
expressions, leading to an unauthenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE)
vulnerability. Apache Syncope uses Java Bean Validation (JSR 380)
custom constraint validators. When building custom constraint
violation error messages, they support different types of
interpolation, including Java EL expressions. Therefore, if an
attacker can inject arbitrary data in the error message template being
passed, they will be able to run arbitrary Java code.

Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function
during or after a TLS 1.3 handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer
dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the
"signature_algorithms_cert" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an
invalid or unrecognised signature algorithm is received from the peer.
This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of Service
attack. OpenSSL version 1.1.1d, 1.1.1e, and 1.1.1f are affected by
this issue. This issue did not affect OpenSSL versions prior to
1.1.1d. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1g (Affected 1.1.1d-1.1.1f).

In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to
eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS
connection. The attack can only be exploited if an implementation re-
uses a DH secret across multiple TLS connections. Note that this issue
only impacts DH ciphersuites and not ECDH ciphersuites. This issue
affects OpenSSL 1.0.2 which is out of support and no longer receiving
public updates. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is not vulnerable to this issue. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.0.2w (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2v).

Reference: MLIST:[tomcat-dev] 20210207 [Bug 65126] New: A security vulnerability cve-2020-1971 in Tomcat dependency Library in version 9.0.40.

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing
different types of names. One of those name types is known as
EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which
compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are
equal or not. This function behaves incorrectly when both
GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer dereference and
a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack.
OpenSSL itself uses the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1)
Comparing CRL distribution point names between an available CRL and a
CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certificate 2) When
verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp
authority name (exposed via the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response
and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control both items being
compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the
attacker can trick a client or server into checking a malicious
certificate against a malicious CRL then this may occur. Note that
some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded
in a certificate. This checking happens prior to the signatures on the
certificate and CRL being verified. OpenSSL's s_server, s_client and
verify tools have support for the "-crl_download" option which
implements automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been
demonstrated to work against those tools. Note that an unrelated bug
means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct
correct encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct
a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that OpenSSL's parser will accept and hence
trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are affected
by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not
been checked. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

TechSupport files generated on Palo Alto Networks VM Series firewalls
for Microsoft Azure platform configured with high availability (HA)
inadvertently collect Azure dashboard service account credentials.
These credentials are equivalent to the credentials associated with
the Contributor role in Azure. A user with the credentials will be
able to manage all the Azure resources in the subscription except for
granting access to other resources. These credentials do not allow
login access to the VMs themselves. This issue affects VM Series
Plugin versions before 1.0.9 for PAN-OS 9.0. This issue does not
affect VM Series in non-HA configurations or on other cloud platforms.
It does not affect hardware firewall appliances. Since becoming aware
of the issue, Palo Alto Networks has safely deleted all the tech
support files with the credentials. We now filter and remove these
credentials from all TechSupport files sent to us. The TechSupport
files uploaded to Palo Alto Networks systems were only accessible by
authorized personnel with valid Palo Alto Networks credentials. We do
not have any evidence of malicious access or use of these credentials.

** DISPUTED ** Integer overflow vulnerability in tool_operate.c in
curl 7.65.2 via a large value as the retry delay. NOTE: many parties
report that this has no direct security impact on the curl user;
however, it may (in theory) cause a denial of service to associated
systems or networks if, for example, --retry-delay is misinterpreted
as a value much smaller than what was intended. This is not especially
plausible because the overflow only happens if the user was trying to
specify that curl should wait weeks (or longer) before trying to
recover from a transient error.
