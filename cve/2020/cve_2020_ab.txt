recycles the TCP connection to the forward proxy, the victim's browser
may suddenly start sending sensitive data to a *.example.com server.
This occurs because the forward proxy between the victim and the
origin server reuses connections (which obeys the specification), but
neither Istio nor Envoy corrects this by sending a 421 error.
Similarly, this behavior voids the security model browsers have put in
place between domains.

logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker who
successfully exploited the vulnerability could take control of an
affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view,
change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user
rights.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by
modifying how the ChakraCore scripting engine handles objects in

An issue was discovered in OpenVPN 2.4.x before 2.4.9. An attacker can
inject a data channel v2 (P_DATA_V2) packet using a victim's peer-id.
Normally such packets are dropped, but if this packet arrives before
the data channel crypto parameters have been initialized, the victim's
connection will be dropped. This requires careful timing due to the
small time window (usually within a few seconds) between the victim
client connection starting and the server PUSH_REPLY response back to
the client. This attack will only work if Negotiable Cipher Parameters

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel
software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user
is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take
control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer
user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who
operate with administrative user rights.</p> <p>Exploitation of the
vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with
an affected version of Microsoft Excel. In an email attack scenario,
an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially
crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In
a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or
leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided
content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the
vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit
the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to
click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant
message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted
file.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by
correcting how Microsoft Excel handles objects in memory.</p>

OpenURL() in usersession/userd/launcher.go would alter $XDG_DATA_DIRS
to append a path to a directory controlled by the calling snap. A
malicious snap could exploit this to bypass intended access
restrictions to control how the host system xdg-open script opens the
URL and, for example, execute a script shipped with the snap without
confinement. This issue did not affect Ubuntu Core systems. Fixed in
snapd versions 2.45.1ubuntu0.2, 2.45.1+18.04.2 and 2.45.1+20.04.2.

In nDPI through 3.2 Stable, the SSH protocol dissector has multiple
KEXINIT integer overflows that result in a controlled remote heap
overflow in concat_hash_string in ssh.c. Due to the granular nature of
the overflow primitive and the ability to control both the contents

this vulnerability may be abused to achieve full Remote Code Execution
against any network inspection stack that is linked against nDPI and
uses it to perform network traffic analysis.

As mitigation for CVE-2020-1945 Apache Ant 1.10.8 changed the
permissions of temporary files it created so that only the current
user was allowed to access them. Unfortunately the fixcrlf task
deleted the temporary file and created a new one without said
protection, effectively nullifying the effort. This would still allow
an attacker to inject modified source files into the build process.

to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as
change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in
the browser of the user.</p> <p>The security update addresses the
vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly
sanitizes web requests.</p>

Name: CVE-2020-11980
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:http://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2020-11980.txt
Reference: URL:http://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2020-11980.txt

In Karaf, JMX authentication takes place using JAAS and authorization
takes place using ACL files. By default, only an "admin" can actually
invoke on an MBean. However there is a vulnerability there for someone
who is not an admin, but has a "viewer" role. In the
'etc/jmx.acl.cfg', such as role can call get*. It's possible to
authenticate as a viewer role + invokes on the MLet getMBeansFromURL
method, which goes off to a remote server to fetch the desired MBean,
which is then registered in Karaf. At this point the attack fails as
"viewer" doesn't have the permission to invoke on the MBean. Still, it
could act as a SSRF style attack and also it essentially allows a
"viewer" role to pollute the MBean registry, which is a kind of
privilege escalation. The vulnerability is low as it's possible to add
a ACL to limit access. Users should update to Apache Karaf 4.2.9 or
newer.

An issue was found in Apache Airflow versions 1.10.10 and below. When
using CeleryExecutor, if an attacker can connect to the broker (Redis,
RabbitMQ) directly, it is possible to inject commands, resulting in
the celery worker running arbitrary commands.

IP address spoofing when proxying using mod_remoteip and mod_rewrite
For configurations using proxying with mod_remoteip and certain
mod_rewrite rules, an attacker could spoof their IP address for
logging and PHP scripts. Note this issue was fixed in Apache HTTP
Server 2.4.24 but was retrospectively allocated a low severity CVE in

To be able to analyze gradle projects, the build scripts need to be
executed. Apache NetBeans follows this pattern. This causes the code
of the build script to be invoked at load time of the project. Apache
NetBeans up to and including 12.0 did not request consent from the
user for the analysis of the project at load time. This in turn will
run potentially malicious code, from an external source, without the
consent of the user.

Apache XmlGraphics Commons 2.4 and earlier is vulnerable to server-
side request forgery, caused by improper input validation by the
XMPParser. By using a specially-crafted argument, an attacker could
exploit this vulnerability to cause the underlying server to make
arbitrary GET requests. Users should upgrade to 2.6 or later.

Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.20 to 2.4.43 When trace/debug was
enabled for the HTTP/2 module and on certain traffic edge patterns,
logging statements were made on the wrong connection, causing
concurrent use of memory pools. Configuring the LogLevel of mod_http2
above "info" will mitigate this vulnerability for unpatched servers.

A deserialization vulnerability existed in dubbo 2.7.5 and its earlier
versions, which could lead to malicious code execution. Most Dubbo
users use Hessian2 as the default serialization/deserialization
protool, during Hessian2 deserializing the HashMap object, some
functions in the classes stored in HasMap will be executed after a
series of program calls, however, those special functions may cause
remote command execution. For example, the hashCode() function of the
EqualsBean class in rome-1.7.0.jar will cause the remotely load
malicious classes and execute malicious code by constructing a
malicious request. This issue was fixed in Apache Dubbo 2.6.9 and
2.7.8.

A regression has been introduced in the commit preventing JMX re-bind.
By passing an empty environment map to RMIConnectorServer, instead of
the map that contains the authentication credentials, it leaves
ActiveMQ open to the following attack: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/

create a javax.management.loading.MLet MBean and use it to create new
MBeans from arbitrary URLs, at least if there is no security manager.

An issue was discovered in Nitrokey FIDO U2F firmware through 1.1.
Communication between the microcontroller and the secure element
transmits credentials in plain. This allows an adversary to eavesdrop
the communication and derive the secrets stored in the
microcontroller. As a result, the attacker is able to arbitrarily
manipulate the firmware of the microcontroller.

** DISPUTED ** The scp client in OpenSSH 8.2 incorrectly sends
duplicate responses to the server upon a utimes system call failure,
which allows a malicious unprivileged user on the remote server to
overwrite arbitrary files in the client's download directory by
creating a crafted subdirectory anywhere on the remote server. The
victim must use the command scp -rp to download a file hierarchy
containing, anywhere inside, this crafted subdirectory. NOTE: the
vendor points out that "this attack can achieve no more than a hostile
peer is already able to achieve within the scp protocol" and "utimes
does not fail under normal circumstances."

** DISPUTED ** A certain Postfix 2.10.1-7 package could allow an
attacker to send an email from an arbitrary-looking sender via a
homoglyph attack, as demonstrated by the similarity of \xce\xbf to the
'o' character. This is potentially relevant when the
/etc/postfix/sender_login feature is used, because a spoofed outbound
message that uses a configured sender address is blocked with a
"Sender address rejected: not logged in" error message, but a spoofed
outbound message that uses a homoglyph of a configured sender address
is not blocked. NOTE: some third parties argue that any missed
blocking of spoofed outbound messages - except for exact matches to a
sender address in the /etc/postfix/sender_login file - is outside the
design goals of Postfix and thus cannot be considered a Postfix
vulnerability.

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word
software when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An
attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a
specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of
the current user. For example, the file could then take actions on
behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current
user.</p> <p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a
specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Word
software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the
vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and
convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario,
an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website
that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially
crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However,
an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website.
Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link,
typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger
message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted
file.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by
correcting how Microsoft Word handles files in memory.</p>

<p>A cross-site-scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists when Microsoft
SharePoint Server does not properly sanitize a specially crafted web
request to an affected SharePoint server. An authenticated attacker
could exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request
to an affected SharePoint server.</p> <p>The attacker who successfully
exploited the vulnerability could then perform cross-site scripting
attacks on affected systems and run script in the security context of
the current user. The attacks could allow the attacker to read content
that the attacker is not authorized to read, use the victim's identity
to take actions on the SharePoint site on behalf of the user, such as
change permissions and delete content, and inject malicious content in
the browser of the user.</p> <p>The security update addresses the
vulnerability by helping to ensure that SharePoint Server properly
sanitizes web requests.</p>

** DISPUTED ** React Native Bluetooth Scan in Bluezone 1.0.0 uses six-
character alphanumeric IDs, which might make it easier for remote
attackers to interfere with COVID-19 contact tracing by using many
IDs. NOTE: the vendor disputes the relevance of this report because
the recipient of an F1 alert will know it was a false alert if
contact-history comparison fails (i.e., an F0 is not actually part of
the contact history obtained from the device of this recipient, or
this recipient is not actually part of the contact history obtained
from the device of an F0).

exfiltrated usernames and hashed passwords for the local device
admin(s), portal admins, and user accounts used for remote access (but
not external Active Directory or LDAP passwords)

During RSA key generation, bignum implementations used a variation of
the Binary Extended Euclidean Algorithm which entailed significantly
input-dependent flow. This allowed an attacker able to perform
electromagnetic-based side channel attacks to record traces leading to
the recovery of the secret primes. *Note:* An unmodified Firefox
browser does not generate RSA keys in normal operation and is not
affected, but products built on top of it might. This vulnerability
affects Firefox < 78.

Beckhoff's TwinCAT RT network driver for Intel 8254x and 8255x is
providing EtherCAT functionality. The driver implements real-time
features. Except for Ethernet frames sent from real-time
functionality, all other Ethernet frames sent through the driver are
not padded if their payload is less than the minimum Ethernet frame
size. Instead, arbitrary memory content is transmitted within in the
padding bytes of the frame. Most likely this memory contains slices
from previously transmitted or received frames. By this method, memory
content is disclosed, however, an attacker can hardly control which
memory content is affected. For example, the disclosure can be

The default installation path of the TwinCAT XAR 3.1 software in all
versions is underneath C:\TwinCAT. If the directory does not exist it
and further subdirectories are created with permissions which allow
every local user to modify the content. The default installation
registers TcSysUI.exe for automatic execution upon log in of a user.
If a less privileged user has a local account he or she can replace
TcSysUI.exe. It will be executed automatically by another user during
login. This is also true for users with administrative access.
Consequently, a less privileged user can trick a higher privileged
user into executing code he or she modified this way. By default
Beckhoff&#8217;s IPCs are shipped with TwinCAT software installed this way
and with just a single local user configured. Thus the vulnerability
exists if further less privileged users have been added.

An issue was discovered in BeyondTrust Privilege Management for
Windows through 5.6. When specifying a program to elevate, it can
typically be found within the Program Files (x86) folder and therefore
uses the %ProgramFiles(x86)% environment variable. However, when this
same policy gets pushed to a 32bit machine, this environment variable
does not exist. Therefore, since the standard user can create a user
level environment variable, they can repoint this variable to any
folder the user has full control of. Then, the folder structure can be
created in such a way that a rule matches and arbitrary code runs
elevated.

An issue was discovered in BeyondTrust Privilege Management for
Windows through 5.6. An attacker can spawn a process with multiple
users as part of the security token (prior to Avecto elevation). When
Avecto elevates the process, it removes the user who is launching the
process, but not the second user. Therefore this second user still
retains access and can give permission to the process back to the
first user.

** DISPUTED ** gss_mech_free in net/sunrpc/auth_gss/gss_mech_switch.c
in the rpcsec_gss_krb5 implementation in the Linux kernel through
5.6.10 lacks certain domain_release calls, leading to a memory leak.
Note: This was disputed with the assertion that the issue does not
grant any access not already available. It is a problem that on
unloading a specific kernel module some memory is leaked, but loading
kernel modules is a privileged operation. A user could also write a
kernel module to consume any amount of memory they like and load that
replicating the effect of this bug.

An issue was discovered in OpenStack Keystone before 15.0.1, and
16.0.0. The list of roles provided for an OAuth1 access token is
silently ignored. Thus, when an access token is used to request a
keystone token, the keystone token contains every role assignment the
creator had for the project. This results in the provided keystone
token having more role assignments than the creator intended, possibly
giving unintended escalated access.

If LibreOffice has an encrypted document open and crashes, that
document is auto-saved encrypted. On restart, LibreOffice offers to
restore the document and prompts for the password to decrypt it. If
the recovery is successful, and if the file format of the recovered
document was not LibreOffice's default ODF file format, then affected
versions of LibreOffice default that subsequent saves of the document
are unencrypted. This may lead to a user accidentally saving a
MSOffice file format document unencrypted while believing it to be
encrypted. This issue affects: LibreOffice 6-3 series versions prior
to 6.3.6; 6-4 series versions prior to 6.4.3.

ODF documents can contain forms to be filled out by the user. Similar
to HTML forms, the contained form data can be submitted to a URI, for
example, to an external web server. To create submittable forms, ODF
implements the XForms W3C standard, which allows data to be submitted
without the need for macros or other active scripting Prior to version
6.4.4 LibreOffice allowed forms to be submitted to any URI, including
file: URIs, enabling form submissions to overwrite local files. User-
interaction is required to submit the form, but to avoid the
possibility of malicious documents engineered to maximize the
possibility of inadvertent user submission this feature has now been
limited to http[s] URIs, removing the possibility to overwrite local
files. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice
versions prior to 6.4.4.

A signal access-control issue was discovered in the Linux kernel
before 5.6.5, aka CID-7395ea4e65c2. Because exec_id in
include/linux/sched.h is only 32 bits, an integer overflow can
interfere with a do_notify_parent protection mechanism. A child
process can send an arbitrary signal to a parent process in a
different security domain. Exploitation limitations include the amount
of elapsed time before an integer overflow occurs, and the lack of
scenarios where signals to a parent process present a substantial
operational threat.

Pydio Cells 2.0.4 web application offers an administrative console
named &#8220;Cells Console&#8221; that is available to users with an administrator
role. This console provides an administrator user with the possibility
of changing several settings, including the application&#8217;s mailer
configuration. It is possible to configure a few engines to be used by
the mailer application to send emails. If the user selects the
&#8220;sendmail&#8221; option as the default one, the web application offers to
edit the full path where the sendmail binary is hosted. Since there is
no restriction in place while editing this value, an attacker

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the
Windows Graphics Device Interface (GDI) handles objects in the memory.
An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could take
control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer
user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who
operate with administrative user rights.</p> <p>There are multiple
ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability:</p> <ul> <li>In a
web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted
website that is designed to exploit the vulnerability and then
convince users to view the website. An attacker would have no way to
force users to view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an
attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by
getting them to open an email attachment or click a link in an email
or instant message.</li> <li>In a file-sharing attack scenario, an
attacker could provide a specially crafted document file that is
designed to exploit the vulnerability, and then convince users to open
the document file.</li> </ul> <p>The security update addresses the
vulnerability by correcting the way that the Windows GDI handles

The update feature for Pydio Cells 2.0.4 allows an administrator user
to set a custom update URL and the public RSA key used to validate the
downloaded update package. The update process involves downloading the
updated binary file from a URL indicated in the update server
response, validating its checksum and signature with the provided
public key and finally replacing the current application binary. To
complete the update process, the application&#8217;s service or appliance
needs to be restarted. An attacker with administrator access can
leverage the software update feature to force the application to
download a custom binary that will replace current Pydio Cells binary.
When the server or service is eventually restarted the attacker will
be able to execute code under the privileges of the user running the
application. In the Pydio Cells enterprise appliance this is with the
privileges of the user named &#8220;pydio&#8221;.

Buffer over-reads were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS
5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP
packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses CoAP input
linearly using a while loop. Once an option is parsed in a loop, the
current point (*packet_data_pptr) is increased correspondingly. The
pointer is restricted by the size of the received buffer, as well as
by the option delta and option length bytes. The actual input packet
length is not verified against the number of bytes read when
processing the option extended delta and the option extended length.
Moreover, the calculation of the message_left variable, in the case of
non-extended option deltas, is incorrect and indicates more data left
for processing than provided in the function input. All of these lead
to heap-based or stack-based memory location read access that is
outside of the intended boundary of the buffer. Depending on the
platform-specific memory management mechanisms, it can lead to
processing of unintended inputs or system memory access violation
errors.

A buffer over-read was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS
5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP
packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options()
parses CoAP options that may occur multiple consecutive times in a
single packet. While processing the options, packet_data_pptr is
accessed after being incremented by option_len without a prior out-of-
bounds memory check. The temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is validated for a
correct range, but the range valid for temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr is
derived from the amount of allocated heap memory, not the actual input
size. Therefore the check of temp_parsed_uri_query_ptr may be
insufficient for safe access to the area pointed to by
packet_data_pptr. As a result, access to a memory area outside of the
intended boundary of the packet buffer is made.

An infinite loop was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS
5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP
packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse_multiple_options()
parses CoAP options in a while loop. This loop's exit condition is
computed using the previously allocated heap memory required for
storing the result of parsing multiple options. If the input heap
memory calculation results in zero bytes, the loop exit condition is
never met and the loop is not terminated. As a result, the packet
parsing function never exits, leading to resource consumption.

A buffer over-read was discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS
5.15.3. The CoAP parser is responsible for parsing received CoAP
packets. The function sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP
packet header starting from the message token. The length of the token
in the received message is provided in the first byte parsed by the
sn_coap_parser_options_parse() function. The length encoded in the
message is not validated against the actual input buffer length before
accessing the token. As a result, memory access outside of the
intended boundary of the buffer may occur.

Memory leaks were discovered in the CoAP library in Arm Mbed OS 5.15.3
when using the Arm mbed-coap library 5.1.5. The CoAP parser is
responsible for parsing received CoAP packets. The function
sn_coap_parser_options_parse() parses the CoAP option number field of
all options present in the input packet. Each option number is
calculated as a sum of the previous option number and a delta of the
current option. The delta and the previous option number are expressed
as unsigned 16-bit integers. Due to lack of overflow detection, it is
possible to craft a packet that wraps the option number around and
results in the same option number being processed again in a single
packet. Certain options allocate memory by calling a memory allocation
function. In the cases of COAP_OPTION_URI_QUERY, COAP_OPTION_URI_PATH,
COAP_OPTION_LOCATION_QUERY, and COAP_OPTION_ETAG, there is no check on
whether memory has already been allocated, which in conjunction with
the option number integer overflow may lead to multiple assignments of
allocated memory to a single pointer. This has been demonstrated to
lead to memory leak by buffer orphaning. As a result, the memory is
never freed.

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel
software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user
is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take
control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer
user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who
operate with administrative user rights.</p> <p>Exploitation of the
vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with
an affected version of Microsoft Excel. In an email attack scenario,
an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially
crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In
a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or
leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided
content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the
vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit
the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to
click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant
message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted
file.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by
correcting how Microsoft Excel handles objects in memory.</p>

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Excel
software when the software fails to properly handle objects in memory.
An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run
arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user
is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take
control of the affected system. An attacker could then install
programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with
full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer
user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who
operate with administrative user rights.</p> <p>Exploitation of the
vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with
an affected version of Microsoft Excel. In an email attack scenario,
an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially
crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file. In
a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could host a website (or
leverage a compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided
content) containing a specially crafted file designed to exploit the
vulnerability. An attacker would have no way to force users to visit
the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to
click a link, typically by way of an enticement in an email or instant
message, and then convince them to open the specially crafted
file.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by
correcting how Microsoft Excel handles objects in memory.</p>

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Print
Spooler service improperly allows arbitrary writing to the file
system. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability
could run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An attacker
could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create
new accounts with full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability, an
attacker would have to log on to an affected system and run a
specially crafted script or application. The update addresses the
vulnerability by correcting how the Windows Print Spooler Component
writes to the file system.

The avatar feature in Grafana 3.0.1 through 7.0.1 has an SSRF
Incorrect Access Control issue. This vulnerability allows any
unauthenticated user/client to make Grafana send HTTP requests to any
URL and return its result to the user/client. This can be used to gain
information about the network that Grafana is running on. Furthermore,
passing invalid URL objects could be used for DOS'ing Grafana via
SegFault.

<p>A remote code execution vulnerability exists in Microsoft Word
software when it fails to properly handle objects in memory. An
attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a
specially crafted file to perform actions in the security context of
the current user. For example, the file could then take actions on
behalf of the logged-on user with the same permissions as the current
user.</p> <p>To exploit the vulnerability, a user must open a
specially crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft Word
software. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the
vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and
convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario,
an attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised website
that accepts or hosts user-provided content) that contains a specially
crafted file that is designed to exploit the vulnerability. However,
an attacker would have no way to force the user to visit the website.
Instead, an attacker would have to convince the user to click a link,
typically by way of an enticement in an email or Instant Messenger
message, and then convince the user to open the specially crafted
file.</p> <p>The security update addresses the vulnerability by
correcting how Microsoft Word handles files in memory.</p>

In SmartDraw 2020 27.0.0.0, the installer gives inherited write
permissions to the Authenticated Users group on the SmartDraw 2020
installation folder. Additionally, when the product is installed, two
scheduled tasks are created on the machine, SDMsgUpdate (Local) and
SDMsgUpdate (TE). The scheduled tasks run in the context of the user
who installed the product. Both scheduled tasks attempt to run the
same binary, C:\SmartDraw 2020\Messages\SDNotify.exe. The folder
Messages doesn't exist by default and (by extension) neither does
SDNotify.exe. Due to the weak folder permissions, these can be created
by any user. A malicious actor can therefore create a malicious
SDNotify.exe binary, and have it automatically run, whenever the user
who installed the product logs on to the machine. The malicious
SDNotify.exe could, for example, create a new local administrator
account on the machine.

There is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the router's web server --
httpd. While processing the /goform/openSchedWifi schedStartTime and
schedEndTime parameters for a POST request, a value is directly used
in a strcpy to a local variable placed on the stack, which overwrites
the return address of a function. An attacker can construct a payload
to carry out arbitrary code execution attacks.

A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Media Audio
Codec improperly handles objects. An attacker who successfully
exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system.
There are multiple ways an attacker could exploit the vulnerability,
such as by convincing a user to open a specially crafted document, or
by convincing a user to visit a malicious webpage. The security update
addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows Media Audio
Codec handles objects.

An issue was discovered in LinuxTV xawtv before 3.107. The function
dev_open() in v4l-conf.c does not perform sufficient checks to prevent
an unprivileged caller of the program from opening unintended
filesystem paths. This allows a local attacker with access to the
v4l-conf setuid-root program to test for the existence of arbitrary
files and to trigger an open on arbitrary files with mode O_RDWR. To
achieve this, relative path components need to be added to the device
path, as demonstrated by a v4l-conf -c /dev/../root/.bash_history
command.

An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when the Windows Kernel
API improperly handles registry objects in memory. An attacker who
successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain elevated
privileges on a targeted system. A locally authenticated attacker
could exploit this vulnerability by running a specially crafted

A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that the
scripting engine handles objects in memory in Internet Explorer. The
vulnerability could corrupt memory in such a way that an attacker
could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An
attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on
with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully
exploited the vulnerability could take control of an affected system.
An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data;
or create new accounts with full user rights. In a web-based attack
scenario, an attacker could host a specially crafted website that is
designed to exploit the vulnerability through Internet Explorer and
then convince a user to view the website. An attacker could also embed
an ActiveX control marked &quot;safe for initialization&quot; in an
application or Microsoft Office document that hosts the IE rendering
engine. The attacker could also take advantage of compromised websites
and websites that accept or host user-provided content or
advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content
that could exploit the vulnerability. The security update addresses
the vulnerability by modifying how the scripting engine handles
objects in memory.

Apache ActiveMQ uses LocateRegistry.createRegistry() to create the JMX
RMI registry and binds the server to the "jmxrmi" entry. It is
possible to connect to the registry without authentication and call
the rebind method to rebind jmxrmi to something else. If an attacker
creates another server to proxy the original, and bound that, he
effectively becomes a man in the middle and is able to intercept the
credentials when an user connects. Upgrade to Apache ActiveMQ 5.15.12.

The previous default setting for Airflow's Experimental API was to
allow all API requests without authentication, but this poses security
risks to users who miss this fact. From Airflow 1.10.11 the default
has been changed to deny all requests by default and is documented at
https://airflow.apache.org/docs/1.10.11/security.html#api-
authentication. Note this change fixes it for new installs but
existing users need to change their config to default
`[api]auth_backend = airflow.api.auth.backend.deny_all` as mentioned

An attacker that is able to modify Velocity templates may execute
arbitrary Java code or run arbitrary system commands with the same
privileges as the account running the Servlet container. This applies
to applications that allow untrusted users to upload/modify velocity
templates running Apache Velocity Engine versions up to 2.2.

It is possible to inject malicious OGNL or MVEL scripts into the
/context.json public endpoint. This was partially fixed in 1.5.1 but a
new attack vector was found. In Apache Unomi version 1.5.2 scripts are
now completely filtered from the input. It is highly recommended to
upgrade to the latest available version of the 1.5.x release to fix
this problem.

In Apache Cassandra, all versions prior to 2.1.22, 2.2.18, 3.0.22,
3.11.8 and 4.0-beta2, it is possible for a local attacker without
access to the Apache Cassandra process or configuration files to
manipulate the RMI registry to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and
capture user names and passwords used to access the JMX interface. The
attacker can then use these credentials to access the JMX interface
and perform unauthorised operations. Users should also be aware of
CVE-2019-2684, a JRE vulnerability that enables this issue to be
exploited remotely.

While investigating a bug report on Apache Superset, it was determined
that an authenticated user could craft requests via a number of
templated text fields in the product that would allow arbitrary access
to Python&#8217;s `os` package in the web application process in versions <
0.37.1. It was thus possible for an authenticated user to list and
access files, environment variables, and process information.
Additionally it was possible to set environment variables for the
current process, create and update files in folders writable by the
web process, and execute arbitrary programs accessible by the web
process. All other operations available to the `os` package in Python
were also available, even if not explicitly enumerated in this CVE.

In the course of work on the open source project it was discovered
that authenticated users running queries against Hive and Presto
database engines could access information via a number of templated
fields including the contents of query description metadata database,
the hashed version of the authenticated users&#8217; password, and access to
connection information including the plaintext password for the
current connection. It would also be possible to run arbitrary methods
on the database connection object for the Presto or Hive connection,
allowing the user to bypass security controls internal to Superset.
This vulnerability is present in every Apache Superset version <
0.37.2.

By default, Apache CXF creates a /services page containing a listing
of the available endpoint names and addresses. This webpage is
vulnerable to a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack via the
styleSheetPath, which allows a malicious actor to inject javascript
into the web page. This vulnerability affects all versions of Apache
CXF prior to 3.4.1 and 3.3.8. Please note that this is a separate
issue to CVE-2019-17573.

HttpUtils#getURLConnection method disables explicitly hostname
verification for HTTPS connections making clients vulnerable to man-
in-the-middle attacks. Calcite uses internally this method to connect
with Druid and Splunk so information leakage may happen when using the
respective Calcite adapters. The method itself is in a utility class
so people may use it to create vulnerable HTTPS connections for other
applications. From Apache Calcite 1.26 onwards, the hostname
verification will be performed using the default JVM truststore.

Apache Solr versions 6.6.0 to 6.6.6, 7.0.0 to 7.7.3 and 8.0.0 to 8.6.2
prevents some features considered dangerous (which could be used for
remote code execution) to be configured in a ConfigSet that's uploaded
via API without authentication/authorization. The checks in place to
prevent such features can be circumvented by using a combination of
UPLOAD/CREATE actions.

The default error page for VelocityView in Apache Velocity Tools prior
to 3.1 reflects back the vm file that was entered as part of the URL.
An attacker can set an XSS payload file as this vm file in the URL
which results in this payload being executed. XSS vulnerabilities
allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the
attacked website and the attacked user. This can be abused to steal
session cookies, perform requests in the name of the victim or for
phishing attacks.

Reference: MISC:https://www.riverloopsecurity.com/blog/2020/09/nitf-extract75-cve-2020-13995/

U.S. Air Force Sensor Data Management System extract75 has a buffer
overflow that leads to code execution. An overflow in a global
variable (sBuffer) leads to a Write-What-Where outcome. Writing beyond
sBuffer will clobber most global variables until reaching a pointer
such as DES_info or image_info. By controlling that pointer, one
achieves an arbitrary write when its fields are assigned. The data
written is from a potentially untrusted NITF file in the form of an
integer. The attacker can gain control of the instruction pointer.

MIT Lifelong Kindergarten Scratch scratch-vm before
0.2.0-prerelease.20200714185213 loads extension URLs from untrusted
project.json files with certain _ characters, resulting in remote code
execution because the URL's content is treated as a script and is
executed as a worker. The responsible code is getExtensionIdForOpcode
in serialization/sb3.js. The use of _ is incompatible with a
protection mechanism in older versions, in which URLs were split and
consequently deserialization attacks were prevented. NOTE: the
scratch.mit.edu hosted service is not affected because of the lack of
worker scripts.

states "This is a functionality of the software that is limited to a
very limited subset of accounts. If you give someone the privilege to
execute arbitrary code on your server, they can execute arbitrary code
on your server. We provide very clear warnings to users around this
functionality and what it provides."

CVE-2016-9962 - could possibly allow a process inside container to
compromise a process entering container namespace and execute
arbitrary code outside of the container. This could lead to compromise
of the container host or other containers running on the same
container host. This issue only affects a single version of Docker,
1.13.1-108.git4ef4b30, shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7. Both
earlier and later versions are not affected.

A flaw was found in Eclipse Che in versions prior to 7.14.0 that
impacts CodeReady Workspaces. When configured with cookies
authentication, Theia IDE doesn't properly set the SameSite value,
allowing a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) and consequently allowing
a cross-site WebSocket hijack on Theia IDE. This flaw allows an
attacker to gain full access to the victim's workspace through the
/services endpoint. To perform a successful attack, the attacker
conducts a Man-in-the-middle attack (MITM) and tricks the victim into

A flaw was found in grub2 in versions prior to 2.06, where it
incorrectly enables the usage of the ACPI command when Secure Boot is
enabled. This flaw allows an attacker with privileged access to craft
a Secondary System Description Table (SSDT) containing code to
overwrite the Linux kernel lockdown variable content directly into
memory. The table is further loaded and executed by the kernel,
defeating its Secure Boot lockdown and allowing the attacker to load
unsigned code. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data

A vulnerability was found in upstream release cryptsetup-2.2.0 where,
there's a bug in LUKS2 format validation code, that is effectively
invoked on every device/image presenting itself as LUKS2 container.
The bug is in segments validation code in file
'lib/luks2/luks2_json_metadata.c' in function
hdr_validate_segments(struct crypt_device *cd, json_object *hdr_jobj)
where the code does not check for possible overflow on memory
allocation used for intervals array (see statement "intervals =
malloc(first_backup * sizeof(*intervals));"). Due to the bug, library
can be *tricked* to expect such allocation was successful but for far
less memory then originally expected. Later it may read data FROM
image crafted by an attacker and actually write such data BEYOND
allocated memory.
