** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** In ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a
version from 2014), the Web Application in /archibus/login.axvw assign
a session token that could be already in use by another user. It was
therefore possible to access the application through a user whose
credentials were not known, without any attempt by the testers to
modify the application logic. It is also possible to set the value of
the session token, client-side, simply by making an unauthenticated
GET Request to the Home Page and adding an arbitrary value to the
JSESSIONID field. The application, following the login, does not
assign a new token, continuing to keep the inserted one, as the
identifier of the entire session. This is fixed in all recent
versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This vulnerability only affects
products that are no longer supported by the maintainer. Version 21.3
was officially de-supported by the end of 2020.

Reference: MISC:https://www.gruppotim.it/redteam

** UNSUPPORTED WHEN ASSIGNED ** ARCHIBUS Web Central 21.3.3.815 (a
version from 2014) does not properly validate requests for access to
data and functionality in these affected endpoints:
/archibus/schema/ab-edit-users.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-data-
dictionary-table.axvw, /archibus/schema/ab-schema-add-field.axvw,
/archibus/schema/ab-core/views/process-navigator/ab-my-user-
profile.axvw. By not verifying the permissions for access to
resources, it allows a potential attacker to view pages that are not
allowed. Specifically, it was found that any authenticated user can
reach the administrative console for user management by directly
requesting access to the page via URL. This allows a malicious user to
modify all users' profiles, to elevate any privileges to
administrative ones, or to create or delete any type of user. It is
also possible to modify the emails of other users, through a
misconfiguration of the username parameter, on the user profile page.
This is fixed in all recent versions, such as version 26. NOTE: This
vulnerability only affects products that are no longer supported by
the maintainer. Version 21.3 was officially de-supported by the end of

In Apache Pulsar it is possible to access data from BookKeeper that
does not belong to the topics accessible by the authenticated user.
The Admin API get-message-by-id requires the user to input a topic and
a ledger id. The ledger id is a pointer to the data, and it is
supposed to be a valid it for the topic. Authorisation controls are
performed against the topic name and there is not proper validation
the that ledger id is valid in the context of such ledger. So it may
happen that the user is able to read from a ledger that contains data
owned by another tenant. This issue affects Apache Pulsar Apache

A UI misrepresentation vulnerability was identified in GitHub
Enterprise Server that allowed more permissions to be granted during a
GitHub App's user-authorization web flow than was displayed to the
user during approval. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would
need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize
the application through the web authentication flow. All permissions
being granted would properly be shown during the first authorization,
but if the user later updated the set of repositories the app was
installed on after the GitHub App had configured additional user-level
permissions, those additional permissions would not be displayed,
leading to more permissions being granted than the user potentially
intended. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub
Enterprise Server prior to 3.3 and was fixed in versions 3.2.5,

There is a carry propagation bug in the MIPS32 and MIPS64 squaring
procedure. Many EC algorithms are affected, including some of the TLS
1.3 default curves. Impact was not analyzed in detail, because the
pre-requisites for attack are considered unlikely and include reusing
private keys. Analysis suggests that attacks against RSA and DSA as a
result of this defect would be very difficult to perform and are not
believed likely. Attacks against DH are considered just feasible
(although very difficult) because most of the work necessary to deduce
information about a private key may be performed offline. The amount
of resources required for such an attack would be significant.
However, for an attack on TLS to be meaningful, the server would have
to share the DH private key among multiple clients, which is no longer
an option since CVE-2016-0701. This issue affects OpenSSL versions
1.0.2, 1.1.1 and 3.0.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1m and
3.0.1 on the 15th of December 2021. For the 1.0.2 release it is
addressed in git commit 6fc1aaaf3 that is available to premium support
customers only. It will be made available in 1.0.2zc when it is
released. The issue only affects OpenSSL on MIPS platforms. Fixed in
OpenSSL 3.0.1 (Affected 3.0.0). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1m (Affected
1.1.1-1.1.1l). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2zc-dev (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zb).

Apache DB DdlUtils 1.0 included a BinaryObjectsHelper that was
intended for use when migrating database data with a SQL data type of
BINARY, VARBINARY, LONGVARBINARY, or BLOB between databases using the
ddlutils features. The BinaryObjectsHelper class was insecure and used
ObjectInputStream.readObject without validating that the input data
was safe to deserialize. Please note that DdlUtils is no longer being
actively developed. To address the insecurity of the
BinaryObjectHelper class, the following changes to DdlUtils have been
made: (1) BinaryObjectsHelper.java has been deleted from the DdlUtils
source repository and the DdlUtils feature of propagating data of SQL
binary types is therefore no longer present in DdlUtils; (2) The
ddlutils-1.0 release has been removed from the Apache Release
Distribution Infrastructure; (3) The DdlUtils web site has been
updated to indicate that DdlUtils is now available only as source
code, not as a packaged release.

Reference: MISC:https://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2021-41766.txt
Reference: URL:https://karaf.apache.org/security/cve-2021-41766.txt

Apache Karaf allows monitoring of applications and the Java runtime by
using the Java Management Extensions (JMX). JMX is a Java RMI based
technology that relies on Java serialized objects for client server
communication. Whereas the default JMX implementation is hardened
against unauthenticated deserialization attacks, the implementation
used by Apache Karaf is not protected against this kind of attack. The
impact of Java deserialization vulnerabilities strongly depends on the
classes that are available within the targets class path. Generally
speaking, deserialization of untrusted data does always represent a
high security risk and should be prevented. The risk is low as, by
default, Karaf uses a limited set of classes in the JMX server class
path. It depends of system scoped classes (e.g. jar in the lib
folder).

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/16/1

A flaw was found in a change made to path normalization in Apache HTTP
Server 2.4.49. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map
URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like
directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by
the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests
can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes,
this could allow for remote code execution. This issue is known to be
exploited in the wild. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and not
earlier versions. The fix in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was found to be
incomplete, see CVE-2021-42013.

ogs_fqdn_parse in Open5GS 1.0.0 through 2.3.3 inappropriately trusts a
client-supplied length value, leading to a buffer overflow. The
attacker can send a PFCP Session Establishment Request with "internet"
as the PDI Network Instance. The first character is interpreted as a
length value to be used in a memcpy call. The destination buffer is
only 100 bytes long on the stack. Then, 'i' gets interpreted as 105
bytes to copy from the source buffer to the destination buffer.

An issue was discovered in Luna Simo PPR1.180610.011/202001031830. It
mishandles software updates such that local third-party apps can
provide a spoofed software update file that contains an arbitrary
shell script and arbitrary ARM binary, where both will be executed as
the root user with an SELinux domain named osi. To exploit this
vulnerability, a local third-party app needs to have write access to
external storage to write the spoofed update at the expected path. The
vulnerable system binary (i.e., /system/bin/osi_bin) does not perform
any authentication of the update file beyond ensuring that it is
encrypted with an AES key (that is hard-coded in the vulnerable system
binary). Processes executing with the osi SELinux domain can
programmatically perform the following actions: install apps, grant
runtime permissions to apps (including permissions with protection
levels of dangerous and development), access extensive Personally
Identifiable Information (PII) using the programmatically grant
permissions, uninstall apps, set the default launcher app to a
malicious launcher app that spoofs other apps, set a network proxy to
intercept network traffic, unload kernel modules, set the default
keyboard to a keyboard that has keylogging functionality, examine
notification contents, send text messages, and more. The spoofed
update can optionally contain an arbitrary ARM binary that will be
locally stored in internal storage and executed at system startup to
achieve persistent code execution as the root user with the osi
SELinux domain. This ARM binary will continue to execute at startup
even if the app that provided the spoofed update is uninstalled.

subject to the /deliveryservices/request Traffic Ops endpoint to send
an email, from the Traffic Ops server, with an arbitrary body to an
arbitrary email address. Apache Traffic Control 5.1.x users should
upgrade to 5.1.3 or 6.0.0. 4.1.x users should upgrade to 5.1.3.

It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server
2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack
to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like
directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by
the usual default configuration "require all denied", these requests
can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes,
this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects
Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

An issue was discovered in Barrier before 2.4.0. The barriers
component (aka the server-side implementation of Barrier) does not
sufficiently verify the identify of connecting clients. Clients can
thus exploit weaknesses in the provided protocol to cause denial-of-
service or stage further attacks that could lead to information leaks
or integrity corruption.

An issue was discovered in Barrier before 2.4.0. An attacker can enter
an active session state with the barriers component (aka the server-
side implementation of Barrier) simply by supplying a client label
that identifies a valid client configuration. This label is "Unnamed"
by default but could instead be guessed from hostnames or other
publicly available information. In the active session state, an
attacker can capture input device events from the server, and also
modify the clipboard content on the server.

Modern DRAM devices (PC-DDR4, LPDDR4X) are affected by a vulnerability
in their internal Target Row Refresh (TRR) mitigation against
Rowhammer attacks. Novel non-uniform Rowhammer access patterns,
consisting of aggressors with different frequencies, phases, and
amplitudes allow triggering bit flips on affected memory modules using
our Blacksmith fuzzer. The patterns generated by Blacksmith were able
to trigger bitflips on all 40 PC-DDR4 DRAM devices in our test pool,
which cover the three major DRAM manufacturers: Samsung, SK Hynix, and
Micron. This means that, even when chips advertised as Rowhammer-free
are used, attackers may still be able to exploit Rowhammer. For
example, this enables privilege-escalation attacks against the kernel
or binaries such as the sudo binary, and also triggering bit flips in
RSA-2048 keys (e.g., SSH keys) to gain cross-tenant virtual-machine
access. We can confirm that DRAM devices acquired in July 2020 with
DRAM chips from all three major DRAM vendors (Samsung, SK Hynix,
Micron) are affected by this vulnerability. For more details, please
refer to our publication.

An issue was discovered in the Dask distributed package before
2021.10.0 for Python. Single machine Dask clusters started with
dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which
defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their
respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically
with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A
Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that
has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated
attacker to achieve remote code execution.

WP DSGVO Tools (GDPR) <= 3.1.23 had an AJAX action, &#8216;admin-dismiss-
unsubscribe&#8216;, which lacked a capability check and a nonce check and
was available to unauthenticated users, and did not check the post
type when deleting unsubscription requests. As such, it was possible
for an attacker to permanently delete an arbitrary post or page on the
site by sending an AJAX request with the &#8220;action&#8221; parameter set to
&#8220;admin-dismiss-unsubscribe&#8221; and the &#8220;id&#8221; parameter set to the post to
be deleted. Sending such a request would move the post to the trash,
and repeating the request would permanently delete the post in
question.

On sites that also had the Elementor plugin for WordPress installed,
it was possible for users with the edit_posts capability, which
includes Contributor-level users, to import blocks onto any page using
the astra-page-elementor-batch-process AJAX action. An attacker could
craft and host a block containing malicious JavaScript on a server
they controlled, and then use it to overwrite any post or page by
sending an AJAX request with the action set to astra-page-elementor-
batch-process and the url parameter pointed to their remotely-hosted
malicious block, as well as an id parameter containing the post or
page to overwrite. Any post or page that had been built with
Elementor, including published pages, could be overwritten by the
imported block, and the malicious JavaScript in the imported block
would then be executed in the browser of any visitors to that page.

The Noise protocol implementation suffers from weakened cryptographic
security after encrypting 2^64 messages, and a potential denial of
service attack. After 2^64 (~18.4 quintillion) messages are encrypted
with the Encrypt function, the nonce counter will wrap around, causing
multiple messages to be encrypted with the same key and nonce. In a
separate issue, the Decrypt function increments the nonce state even
when it fails to decrypt a message. If an attacker can provide an
invalid input to the Decrypt function, this will cause the nonce state
to desynchronize between the peers, resulting in a failure to encrypt
all subsequent messages.

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Bidirectional Algorithm
in the Unicode Specification through 14.0. It permits the visual
reordering of characters via control sequences, which can be used to
craft source code that renders different logic than the logical
ordering of tokens ingested by compilers and interpreters. Adversaries
can leverage this to encode source code for compilers accepting
Unicode such that targeted vulnerabilities are introduced invisibly to
human reviewers. NOTE: the Unicode Consortium offers the following
alternative approach to presenting this concern. An issue is noted in
the nature of international text that can affect applications that
implement support for The Unicode Standard and the Unicode
Bidirectional Algorithm (all versions). Due to text display behavior
when text includes left-to-right and right-to-left characters, the
visual order of tokens may be different from their logical order.
Additionally, control characters needed to fully support the
requirements of bidirectional text can further obfuscate the logical
order of tokens. Unless mitigated, an adversary could craft source
code such that the ordering of tokens perceived by human reviewers
does not match what will be processed by a compiler/interpreter/etc.
The Unicode Consortium has documented this class of vulnerability in
its document, Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security
Considerations. The Unicode Consortium also provides guidance on
mitigations for this class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard
#39, Unicode Security Mechanisms, and in Unicode Standard Annex #31,
Unicode Identifier and Pattern Syntax. Also, the BIDI specification
allows applications to tailor the implementation in ways that can
mitigate misleading visual reordering in program text; see HL4 in
Unicode Standard Annex #9, Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm.

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the character definitions of
the Unicode Specification through 14.0. The specification allows an
adversary to produce source code identifiers such as function names
using homoglyphs that render visually identical to a target
identifier. Adversaries can leverage this to inject code via
adversarial identifier definitions in upstream software dependencies
invoked deceptively in downstream software. NOTE: the Unicode
Consortium offers the following alternative approach to presenting
this concern. An issue is noted in the nature of international text
that can affect applications that implement support for The Unicode
Standard (all versions). Unless mitigated, an adversary could produce
source code identifiers using homoglyph characters that render
visually identical to but are distinct from a target identifier. In
this way, an adversary could inject adversarial identifier definitions
in upstream software that are not detected by human reviewers and are
invoked deceptively in downstream software. The Unicode Consortium has
documented this class of security vulnerability in its document,
Unicode Technical Report #36, Unicode Security Considerations. The
Unicode Consortium also provides guidance on mitigations for this
class of issues in Unicode Technical Standard #39, Unicode Security
Mechanisms.

Reference: MISC:https://www.npmjs.com/package/shell-quote

The shell-quote package before 1.7.3 for Node.js allows command
injection. An attacker can inject unescaped shell metacharacters
through a regex designed to support Windows drive letters. If the
output of this package is passed to a real shell as a quoted argument
to a command with exec(), an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.
This is because the Windows drive letter regex character class is
{A-z] instead of the correct {A-Za-z]. Several shell metacharacters
exist in the space between capital letter Z and lower case letter a,
such as the backtick character.

Reference: URL:https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/routinator/CVE-2021-43172_CVE-2021-43173_CVE-2021-43174.txt

NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2 happily processes a chain of
RRDP repositories of infinite length causing it to never finish a
validation run. In RPKI, a CA can choose the RRDP repository it wishes
to publish its data in. By continuously generating a new child CA that
only consists of another CA using a different RRDP repository, a
malicious CA can create a chain of CAs of de-facto infinite length.
Routinator prior to version 0.10.2 did not contain a limit on the
length of such a chain and will therefore continue to process this
chain forever. As a result, the validation run will never finish,
leading to Routinator continuing to serve the old data set or, if in
the initial validation run directly after starting, never serve any
data at all.

In NLnet Labs Routinator prior to 0.10.2, a validation run can be
delayed significantly by an RRDP repository by not answering but
slowly drip-feeding bytes to keep the connection alive. This can be
used to effectively stall validation. While Routinator has a
configurable time-out value for RRDP connections, this time-out was
only applied to individual read or write operations rather than the
complete request. Thus, if an RRDP repository sends a little bit of
data before that time-out expired, it can continuously extend the time
it takes for the request to finish. Since validation will only
continue once the update of an RRDP repository has concluded, this
delay will cause validation to stall, leading to Routinator continuing
to serve the old data set or, if in the initial validation run
directly after starting, never serve any data at all.

NLnet Labs Routinator versions 0.9.0 up to and including 0.10.1,
support the gzip transfer encoding when querying RRDP repositories.
This encoding can be used by an RRDP repository to cause an out-of-
memory crash in these versions of Routinator. RRDP uses XML which
allows arbitrary amounts of white space in the encoded data. The gzip
scheme compresses such white space extremely well, leading to very
small compressed files that become huge when being decompressed for
further processing, big enough that Routinator runs out of memory when
parsing input data waiting for the next XML element.

The GOautodial API prior to commit 3c3a979 made on October 13th, 2021
exposes an API router that accepts a username, password, and action
that routes to other PHP files that implement the various API
functions. Vulnerable versions of GOautodial validate the username and
password incorrectly, allowing the caller to specify any values for
these parameters and successfully authenticate.

The GOautodial API prior to commit 3c3a979 made on October 13th, 2021
takes a user-supplied &#8220;action&#8221; parameter and appends a .php file
extension to locate and load the correct PHP file to implement the API
call. Vulnerable versions of GOautodial do not sanitize the user input
that specifies the action. This permits an attacker to execute any PHP
source file with a .php extension that is present on the disk and
readable by the GOautodial web server process. Combined with
CVE-2021-43175, it is possible for the attacker to do this without
valid credentials.

The Plus Addons for Elementor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
privilege escalation in versions up to, and including 4.1.9 (pro) and
2.0.6 (free). The plugin adds a registration form to the Elementor
page builders functionality. As part of the registration form, users
can choose which role to set as the default for users upon
registration. This field is not hidden for lower-level users so any
user with access to the Elementor page builder, such as contributors,
can set the default role to administrator. Since contributors can not
publish posts, only author+ users can elevate privileges without
interaction via a site administrator (to approve a post).

features of SQL server to execute system commands and/or access the
local file system. This particular vulnerability can be exploited by
any authenticated user who has been granted access to use the
Duplicate Post plugin. By default, this is limited to Administrators,
however the plugin presents the option to permit access to the Editor,
Author, Contributor and Subscriber roles.

The &#8220;WPO365 | LOGIN&#8221; WordPress plugin (up to and including version
15.3) by wpo365.com is vulnerable to a persistent Cross-Site Scripting
(XSS) vulnerability (also known as Stored or Second-Order XSS).
Persistent XSS vulnerabilities occur when the application stores and
retrieves client supplied data without proper handling of dangerous
content. This type of XSS vulnerability is exploited by submitting
malicious script content to the application which is then retrieved
and executed by other application users. The attacker could exploit
this to conduct a range of attacks against users of the affected
application such as session hijacking, account take over and accessing
sensitive data. In this case, the XSS payload can be submitted by any
anonymous user, the payload then renders and executes when a WordPress
administrator authenticates and accesses the WordPress Dashboard. The
injected payload can carry out actions on behalf of the administrator
including adding other administrative users and changing application
settings. This flaw could be exploited to ultimately provide full
control of the affected system to the attacker.

NSS (Network Security Services) versions prior to 3.73 or 3.68.1 ESR
are vulnerable to a heap overflow when handling DER-encoded DSA or
RSA-PSS signatures. Applications using NSS for handling signatures
encoded within CMS, S/MIME, PKCS \#7, or PKCS \#12 are likely to be
impacted. Applications using NSS for certificate validation or other
TLS, X.509, OCSP or CRL functionality may be impacted, depending on
how they configure NSS. *Note: This vulnerability does NOT impact
Mozilla Firefox.* However, email clients and PDF viewers that use NSS
for signature verification, such as Thunderbird, LibreOffice,
Evolution and Evince are believed to be impacted. This vulnerability
affects NSS < 3.73 and NSS < 3.68.1.

Extension lacked the WebRequest permission for the hosts involved in
the redirect, this would be a same-origin-violation leaking data the

The 'Copy Image Link' context menu action would copy the final image
URL after redirects. By embedding an image that triggered
authentication flows - in conjunction with a Content Security Policy
that stopped a redirection chain in the middle - the final image URL
could be one that contained an authentication token used to takeover a
user account. If a website tricked a user into copy and pasting the
image link back to the page, the page would be able to steal the
authentication tokens. This was fixed by making the action return the
original URL, before any redirects. This vulnerability affects Firefox

The uri-block plugin in Apache APISIX before 2.10.2 uses $request_uri
without verification. The $request_uri is the full original request
URI without normalization. This makes it possible to construct a URI
to bypass the block list on some occasions. For instance, when the
block list contains "^/internal/", a URI like `//internal/` can be
used to bypass it. Some other plugins also have the same issue. And it
may affect the developer's custom plugin.

** DISPUTED ** The npm ci command in npm 7.x and 8.x through 8.1.3
proceeds with an installation even if dependency information in
package-lock.json differs from package.json. This behavior is
inconsistent with the documentation, and makes it easier for attackers
to install malware that was supposed to have been blocked by an exact
version match requirement in package-lock.json. NOTE: The npm team
believes this is not a vulnerability. It would require someone to
socially engineer package.json which has different dependencies than
package-lock.json. That user would have to have file system or write
access to change dependencies. The npm team states preventing
malicious actors from socially engineering or gaining file system
access is outside the scope of the npm CLI.

Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In Redash
version 10.0 and prior, the implementation of Google Login (via OAuth)
incorrectly uses the `state` parameter to pass the next URL to
redirect the user to after login. The `state` parameter should be used
for a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) token, not a static and easily
predicted value. This vulnerability does not affect users who do not
use Google Login for their instance of Redash. A patch in the `master`
and `release/10.x.x` branches addresses this by replacing `Flask-
Oauthlib` with `Authlib` which automatically provides and validates a
CSRF token for the state variable. The new implementation stores the
next URL on the user session object. As a workaround, one may disable
Google Login to mitigate the vulnerability.

Redash is a package for data visualization and sharing. In versions
10.0 and priorm the implementation of URL-loading data sources like
JSON, CSV, or Excel is vulnerable to advanced methods of Server Side
Request Forgery (SSRF). These vulnerabilities are only exploitable on
installations where a URL-loading data source is enabled. As of time
of publication, the `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches address
this by applying the Advocate library for making http requests instead
of the requests library directly. Users should upgrade to version
10.0.1 to receive this patch. There are a few workarounds for
mitigating the vulnerability without upgrading. One can disable the
vulnerable data sources entirely, by adding the following env variable
to one's configuration, making them unavailable inside the webapp. One
can switch any data source of certain types (viewable in the GitHub
Security Advisory) to be `View Only` for all groups on the Settings >
Groups > Data Sources screen. For users unable to update an admin may
modify Redash's configuration through environment variables to
mitigate this issue. Depending on the version of Redash, an admin may
also need to run a CLI command to re-encrypt some fields in the
database. The `master` and `release/10.x.x` branches as of time of
publication have removed the default value for `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET`.
All future releases will also require this to be set explicitly. For
existing installations, one will need to ensure that explicit values
are set for the `REDASH_COOKIE_SECRET` and `REDASH_SECRET_KEY
`variables.

Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a
software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-
Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check
permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is
exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated
a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other
users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g.
all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the
data in the record, and thus e.g. *cannot* change a record from
restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-
Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and
InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively.

Tuleap is a Libre and Open Source tool for end to end traceability of
application and system developments. This is a follow up to
GHSA-887w-pv2r-x8pm/CVE-2021-41276, the initial fix was incomplete.
Tuleap does not sanitize properly the search filter built from the
ldap_id attribute of a user during the daily synchronization. A
malicious user could force accounts to be suspended or take over
another account by forcing the update of the ldap_uid attribute. Note
that the malicious user either need to have site administrator
capability on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the
capability to create/modify account. The Tuleap instance needs to have
the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this issue to be
exploitable. The following versions contain the fix: Tuleap Community
Edition 13.2.99.83, Tuleap Enterprise Edition 13.1-6, and Tuleap

@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend is the backend for the default
Backstage software templates. In affected versions a malicious actor
with write access to a registered scaffolder template is able to
manipulate the template in a way that writes files to arbitrary paths
on the scaffolder-backend host instance. This vulnerability can in
some situation also be exploited through user input when executing a
template, meaning you do not need write access to the templates. This
method will not allow the attacker to control the contents of the
injected file however, unless the template is also crafted in a
specific way that gives control of the file contents. This
vulnerability is fixed in version `0.15.14` of the `@backstage/plugin-
scaffolder-backend`. This attack is mitigated by restricting access
and requiring reviews when registering or modifying scaffolder
templates.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00005.html

runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux
according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used
internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant
container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible
for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc
prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an
integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array
attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array
attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute
contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration.
This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the
configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass
the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own
netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted
are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to
run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc
version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may
try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It
should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the
attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence
of this bug.

Lucet is a native WebAssembly compiler and runtime. There is a bug in
the main branch of `lucet-runtime` affecting all versions published to
crates.io that allows a use-after-free in an Instance object that
could result in memory corruption, data race, or other related issues.
This bug was introduced early in the development of Lucet and is
present in all releases. As a result of this bug, and dependent on the
memory backing for the Instance objects, it is possible to trigger a
use-after-free when the Instance is dropped. Users should upgrade to
the main branch of the Lucet repository. Lucet no longer provides
versioned releases on crates.io. There is no way to remediate this

Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. Zulip Server installs
RabbitMQ for internal message passing. In versions of Zulip Server
prior to 4.9, the initial installation (until first reboot, or restart
of RabbitMQ) does not successfully limit the default ports which
RabbitMQ opens; this includes port 25672, the RabbitMQ distribution
port, which is used as a management port. RabbitMQ's default "cookie"
which protects this port is generated using a weak PRNG, which limits
the entropy of the password to at most 36 bits; in practicality, the
seed for the randomizer is biased, resulting in approximately 20 bits
of entropy. If other firewalls (at the OS or network level) do not
protect port 25672, a remote attacker can brute-force the 20 bits of
entropy in the "cookie" and leverage it for arbitrary execution of
code as the rabbitmq user. They can also read all data which is sent
through RabbitMQ, which includes all message traffic sent by users.
Version 4.9 contains a patch for this vulnerability. As a workaround,
ensure that firewalls prevent access to ports 5672 and 25672 from
outside the Zulip server.

The Pinterest Automatic plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
authorization bypass due to missing capability checks on the
'wp_pinterest_automatic_parse_request' function and the
'process_form.php' script in versions up to, and including, 1.14.3.
This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update
arbitrary options on a site that can be used to create new
administrative user accounts or redirect unsuspecting site visitors.

Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Prior to version 2.5.254,
directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a
storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled on a Windows
host. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file
system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal.
This is only possible on a Wiki.js server running on Windows, when a
storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System
or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g.
cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit number
414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85 fixes this vulnerability by
sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The
sanitization step removes any windows directory traversal sequences
from the path. As a workaround, disable any storage module with local
asset caching capabilities (Local File System, Git).

Etherpad is a real-time collaborative editor. In versions prior to
1.8.16, an attacker can craft an `*.etherpad` file that, when
imported, might allow the attacker to gain admin privileges for the
Etherpad instance. This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious
Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code (including system
commands). To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger
deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session`
state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any `express-
session` state, so the only known attacks require either a plugin that
can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron
job that deletes old `sessionstorage:*` records). The problem has been
fixed in version 1.8.16. If users cannot upgrade to 1.8.16 or install
patches manually, several workarounds are available. Users may
configure their reverse proxies to reject requests to `/p/*/import`,
which will block all imports, not just `*.etherpad` imports; limit all
users to read-only access; and/or prevent the reuse of `express_sid`
cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state. More
detailed information and general mitigation strategies may be found in
the GitHub Security Advisory.

Solidus is a free, open-source ecommerce platform built on Rails.
Versions of Solidus prior to 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have a denial
of service vulnerability that could be exploited during a guest
checkout. The regular expression used to validate a guest order's
email was subject to exponential backtracking through a fragment like
`a.a.` Versions 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have been patched to use a
different regular expression. The maintainers added a check for email
addresses that are no longer valid that will print information about
any affected orders that exist. If a prompt upgrade is not an option,
a workaround is available. It is possible to edit the file
`config/application.rb` manually (with code provided by the
maintainers in the GitHub Security Advisory) to check email validity.

Opencast is an Open Source Lecture Capture & Video Management for
Education. Opencast versions prior to 9.10 allow HTTP method spoofing,
allowing to change the assumed HTTP method via URL parameter. This
allows attackers to turn HTTP GET requests into PUT requests or an
HTTP form to send DELETE requests. This bypasses restrictions
otherwise put on these types of requests and aids in cross-site
request forgery (CSRF) attacks, which would otherwise not be possible.
The vulnerability allows attackers to craft links or forms which may
change the server state. This issue is fixed in Opencast 9.10 and
10.0. You can mitigate the problem by setting the `SameSite=Strict`
attribute for your cookies. If this is a viable option for you depends
on your integrations. We strongly recommend updating in any case.

Laravel is a web application framework. Laravel prior to versions
8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting
(XSS) vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML
element may be clicked and the user taken to another location in their
browser due to XSS. This is due to the user being able to guess the
parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections. If
the parent template contains an exploitable HTML structure an XSS
vulnerability can be exposed. This vulnerability has been patched in
versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 by determining the parent
placeholder at runtime and using a random hash that is unique to each
request.

`Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby.
In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and
apparently harmless `Gemfile`'s, it is not expected that they lead to
execution of external code, unless that's explicit in the ruby code
inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem`
entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly
harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle
dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry,
Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are
being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When
building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid
Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments
instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a
user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an
optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code
Execution because some of the commands have options that can be
leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from
the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading
dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a
directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that
is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL
in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git
clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument.
Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs
to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`,
inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which
could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the
exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user
interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `--`
as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands
that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can
upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`'s before
running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can
contain arbitrary ruby code.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20211210 CVE-2021-43813 and CVE-2021-43815 - Grafana directory traversal for some .md and .csv files
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/10/4

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
Grafana prior to versions 8.3.2 and 7.5.12 contains a directory
traversal vulnerability for fully lowercase or fully uppercase .md
files. The vulnerability is limited in scope, and only allows access
to files with the extension .md to authenticated users only. Grafana
Cloud instances have not been affected by the vulnerability. Users
should upgrade to patched versions 8.3.2 or 7.5.12. For users who
cannot upgrade, running a reverse proxy in front of Grafana that
normalizes the PATH of the request will mitigate the vulnerability.
The proxy will have to also be able to handle url encoded paths.
Alternatively, for fully lowercase or fully uppercase .md files, users
can block /api/plugins/.*/markdown/.* without losing any functionality
beyond inlined plugin help text.

containerd is an open source container runtime. On installations using
SELinux, such as EL8 (CentOS, RHEL), Fedora, or SUSE MicroOS, with
containerd since v1.5.0-beta.0 as the backing container runtime
interface (CRI), an unprivileged pod scheduled to the node may bind
mount, via hostPath volume, any privileged, regular file on disk for
complete read/write access (sans delete). Such is achieved by placing
the in-container location of the hostPath volume mount at either
`/etc/hosts`, `/etc/hostname`, or `/etc/resolv.conf`. These locations
are being relabeled indiscriminately to match the container process-
label which effectively elevates permissions for savvy containers that
would not normally be able to access privileged host files. This issue
has been resolved in version 1.5.9. Users are advised to upgrade as
soon as possible.

Seafile is an open source cloud storage system. A sync token is used
in Seafile file syncing protocol to authorize access to library data.
To improve performance, the token is cached in memory in seaf-server.
Upon receiving a token from sync client or SeaDrive client, the server
checks whether the token exist in the cache. However, if the token
exists in cache, the server doesn't check whether it's associated with
the specific library in the URL. This vulnerability makes it possible
to use any valid sync token to access data from any **known** library.
Note that the attacker has to first find out the ID of a library which
it has no access to. The library ID is a random UUID, which is not
possible to be guessed. There are no workarounds for this issue.

Opencast is an Open Source Lecture Capture & Video Management for
Education. Opencast before version 9.10 or 10.6 allows references to
local file URLs in ingested media packages, allowing attackers to
include local files from Opencast's host machines and making them
available via the web interface. Before Opencast 9.10 and 10.6,
Opencast would open and include local files during ingests. Attackers
could exploit this to include most local files the process has read
access to, extracting secrets from the host machine. An attacker would
need to have the privileges required to add new media to exploit this.
But these are often widely given. The issue has been fixed in Opencast
10.6 and 11.0. You can mitigate this issue by narrowing down the read
access Opencast has to files on the file system using UNIX permissions
or mandatory access control systems like SELinux. This cannot prevent
access to files Opencast needs to read though and we highly recommend
updating.

Jackalope Doctrine-DBAL is an implementation of the PHP Content
Repository API (PHPCR) using a relational database to persist data. In
affected versions users can provoke SQL injections if they can specify
a node name or query. Upgrade to version 1.7.4 to resolve this issue.
If that is not possible, you can escape all places where `$property`
is used to filter `sv:name` in the class
`Jackalope\Transport\DoctrineDBAL\Query\QOMWalker`:
`XPath::escape($property)`. Node names and xpaths can contain `"` or
`;` according to the JCR specification. The jackalope component that
translates the query object model into doctrine dbal queries does not
properly escape the names and paths, so that a accordingly crafted
node name can lead to an SQL injection. If queries are never done from
user input, or if you validate the user input to not contain `;`, you
are not affected.

Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph prior
to version 3.33.2 is vulnerable to a side-channel attack where strings
in private source code could be guessed by an authenticated but
unauthorized actor. This issue affects the Saved Searches and Code
Monitoring features. A successful attack would require an
authenticated bad actor to create many Saved Searches or Code Monitors
to receive confirmation that a specific string exists. This could
allow an attacker to guess formatted tokens in source code, such as
API keys. This issue was patched in version 3.33.2 and any future
versions of Sourcegraph. We strongly encourage upgrading to secure
versions. If you are unable to, you may disable Saved Searches and
Code Monitors.

Envoy is an open source edge and service proxy, designed for cloud-
native applications. Sending a locally generated response must stop
further processing of request or response data. Envoy tracks the
amount of buffered request and response data and aborts the request if
the amount of buffered data is over the limit by sending 413 or 500
responses. However when the buffer overflows while response is
processed by the filter chain the operation may not be aborted
correctly and result in accessing a freed memory block. If this
happens Envoy will crash resulting in a denial of service.

discourse-footnote is a library providing footnotes for posts in
Discourse. ### Impact When posting an inline footnote wrapped in `<a>`
tags (e.g. `<a>^[footnote]</a>`, the resulting rendered HTML would
include a nested `<a>`, which is stripped by Nokogiri because it is
not valid. This then caused a javascript error on topic pages because
we were looking for an `<a>` element inside the footnote reference
span and getting its ID, and because it did not exist we got a null
reference error in javascript. Users are advised to update to version
0.2. As a workaround editing offending posts from the rails console or
the database console for self-hosters, or disabling the plugin in the
admin panel can mitigate this issue.

vault-cli is a configurable command-line interface tool (and python
library) to interact with Hashicorp Vault. In versions before 3.0.0
vault-cli features the ability for rendering templated values. When a
secret starts with the prefix `!template!`, vault-cli interprets the
rest of the contents of the secret as a Jinja2 template. Jinja2 is a
powerful templating engine and is not designed to safely render
arbitrary templates. An attacker controlling a jinja2 template
rendered on a machine can trigger arbitrary code, making this a Remote
Code Execution (RCE) risk. If the content of the vault can be
completely trusted, then this is not a problem. Otherwise, if your
threat model includes cases where an attacker can manipulate a secret
value read from the vault using vault-cli, then this vulnerability may
impact you. In 3.0.0, the code related to interpreting vault templated
secrets has been removed entirely. Users are advised to upgrade as
soon as possible. For users unable to upgrade a workaround does exist.
Using the environment variable `VAULT_CLI_RENDER=false` or the flag
`--no-render` (placed between `vault-cli` and the subcommand, e.g.
`vault-cli --no-render get-all`) or adding `render: false` to the
vault-cli configuration yaml file disables rendering and removes the
vulnerability. Using the python library, you can use:
`vault_cli.get_client(render=False)` when creating your client to get
a client that will not render templated secrets and thus operates
securely.

message_bus is a messaging bus for Ruby processes and web clients. In
versions prior to 3.3.7 users who deployed message bus with
diagnostics features enabled (default off) are vulnerable to a path
traversal bug, which could lead to disclosure of secret information on
a machine if an unintended user were to gain access to the diagnostic
route. The impact is also greater if there is no proxy for your web
application as the number of steps up the directories is not bounded.
For deployments which uses a proxy, the impact varies. For example, If
a request goes through a proxy like Nginx with `merge_slashes`
enabled, the number of steps up the directories that can be read is
limited to 3 levels. This issue has been patched in version 3.3.7.
Users unable to upgrade should ensure that MessageBus::Diagnostics is

Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js versions 2.5.257 and
earlier are vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG
file upload. By creating a crafted SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user
may stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the
attacker to execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is viewed
directly by other users. Scripts do not execute when loaded inside a
page via normal `<img>` tags. Commit
5d3e81496fba1f0fbd64eeb855f30f69a9040718 fixes this vulnerability by
adding an optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to all
file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround, disable
file upload for all non-trusted users. Wiki.js version 2.5.260 is the
first production version to contain a patch. Version 2.5.258 is the
first development build to contain a patch and is available only as a
Docker image as requarks/wiki:canary-2.5.258.

MSEdgeRedirect is a tool to redirect news, search, widgets, weather,
and more to a user's default browser. MSEdgeRedirect versions before
0.5.0.1 are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via specifically
crafted URLs. This vulnerability requires user interaction and the
acceptance of a prompt. With how MSEdgeRedirect is coded, parameters
are impossible to pass to any launched file. However, there are two
possible scenarios in which an attacker can do more than a minor
annoyance. In Scenario 1 (confirmed), a user visits an attacker
controlled webpage; the user is prompted with, and downloads, an
executable payload; the user is prompted with, and accepts, the
aforementioned crafted URL prompt; and RCE executes the payload the
user previously downloaded, if the download path is successfully
guessed. In Scenario 2 (not yet confirmed), a user visits an attacked
controlled webpage; the user is prompted with, and accepts, the
aforementioned crafted URL prompt; and a payload on a remote, attacker
controlled, SMB server is executed. The issue was found in the
_DecodeAndRun() function, in which I incorrectly assumed
_WinAPI_UrlIs() would only accept web resources. Unfortunately,
file:/// passes the default _WinAPI_UrlIs check(). File paths are now
directly checked for and must fail. There is no currently known
exploitation of this vulnerability in the wild. A patched version,
0.5.0.1, has been released that checks for and denies these crafted
URLs. There are no workarounds for this issue. Users are advised not
to accept any unexpected prompts from web pages.

`solidus_frontend` is the cart and storefront for the Solidus
e-commerce project. Versions of `solidus_frontend` prior to 3.1.5,
3.0.5, and 2.11.14 contain a cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
vulnerability that allows a malicious site to add an item to the
user's cart without their knowledge. Versions 3.1.5, 3.0.5, and
2.11.14 contain a patch for this issue. The patch adds CSRF token
verification to the "Add to cart" action. Adding forgery protection to
a form that missed it can have some side effects. Other CSRF
protection strategies as well as a workaround involving modifcation to
config/application.rb` are available. More details on these
mitigations are available in the GitHub Security Advisory.

h2o is an open source http server. In code prior to the `8c0eca3`
commit h2o may attempt to access uninitialized memory. When receiving
QUIC frames in certain order, HTTP/3 server-side implementation of h2o
can be misguided to treat uninitialized memory as HTTP/3 frames that
have been received. When h2o is used as a reverse proxy, an attacker
can abuse this vulnerability to send internal state of h2o to backend
servers controlled by the attacker or third party. Also, if there is
an HTTP endpoint that reflects the traffic sent from the client, an
attacker can use that reflector to obtain internal state of h2o. This
internal state includes traffic of other connections in unencrypted
form and TLS session tickets. This vulnerability exists in h2o server
with HTTP/3 support, between commit 93af138 and d1f0f65. None of the
released versions of h2o are affected by this vulnerability. There are
no known workarounds. Users of unreleased versions of h2o using HTTP/3
are advised to upgrade immediately.

cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio is a plugin provides a single and
simple interface for accessing fingerprint APIs on both Android 6+ and
iOS. In versions prior to 5.0.1 The exported activity
`de.niklasmerz.cordova.biometric.BiometricActivity` can cause the app
to crash. This vulnerability occurred because the activity didn't
handle the case where it is requested with invalid or empty data which
results in a crash. Any third party app can constantly call this
activity with no permission. A 3rd party app/attacker using event
listener can continually stop the app from working and make the victim
unable to open it. Version 5.0.1 of the cordova-plugin-fingerprint-aio
doesn't export the activity anymore and is no longer vulnerable. If
you want to fix older versions change the attribute android:exported
in plugin.xml to false. Please upgrade to version 5.0.1 as soon as
possible.

multiple files in Time Tracker version 1.19.33.5606 and prior due to
not properly checking of the "group" and "status" parameters in POST
requests. Group parameter is posted along when navigating between
organizational subgroups (groups.php file). Status parameter is used
in multiple files to change a status of an entity such as making a
project, task, or user inactive. This issue has been patched in
version 1.19.33.5607. An upgrade is highly recommended. If an upgrade
is not practical, introduce ttValidStatus function as in the latest
version and start using it user input check blocks wherever status
field is used. For groups.php fix, introduce ttValidInteger function
as in the latest version and use it in the access check block in the
file.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a suite of open source Python
modules, data sets, and tutorials supporting research and development
in Natural Language Processing. Versions prior to 3.6.5 are vulnerable
to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) attacks. The
vulnerability is present in PunktSentenceTokenizer, sent_tokenize and
word_tokenize. Any users of this class, or these two functions, are
vulnerable to the ReDoS attack. In short, a specifically crafted long
input to any of these vulnerable functions will cause them to take a
significant amount of execution time. If your program relies on any of
the vulnerable functions for tokenizing unpredictable user input, then
we would strongly recommend upgrading to a version of NLTK without the
vulnerability. For users unable to upgrade the execution time can be
bounded by limiting the maximum length of an input to any of the
vulnerable functions. Our recommendation is to implement such a limit.

Wiki.js is a wiki app built on node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is
vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through a SVG file upload
made via a custom request with a fake MIME type. By creating a crafted
SVG file, a malicious Wiki.js user may stage a stored cross-site

vulnerability by adding an additional file extension verification
check to the optional (enabled by default) SVG sanitization step to
all file uploads that match the SVG mime type. As a workaround,
disable file upload for all non-trusted users.

Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Wiki.js 2.5.263 and earlier is
vulnerable to stored cross-site scripting through non-image file
uploads for file types that can be viewed directly inline in the
browser. By creating a malicious file which can execute inline JS when
viewed in the browser (e.g. XML files), a malicious Wiki.js user may
stage a stored cross-site scripting attack. This allows the attacker
to execute malicious JavaScript when the file is viewed directly by
other users. The file must be opened directly by the user and will not

XStream is an open source java library to serialize objects to XML and
back again. Versions prior to 1.4.19 may allow a remote attacker to
allocate 100% CPU time on the target system depending on CPU type or
parallel execution of such a payload resulting in a denial of service
only by manipulating the processed input stream. XStream 1.4.19
monitors and accumulates the time it takes to add elements to
collections and throws an exception if a set threshold is exceeded.
Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. Users unable to
upgrade may set the NO_REFERENCE mode to prevent recursion. See GHSA-
rmr5-cpv2-vgjf for further details on a workaround if an upgrade is
not possible.

The WP Security Question plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-
Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.5. This is
due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save() function.
This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the
plugin's settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site
administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Flatpak is a Linux application sandboxing and distribution framework.
Prior to versions 1.12.3 and 1.10.6, Flatpak doesn't properly validate
that the permissions displayed to the user for an app at install time
match the actual permissions granted to the app at runtime, in the
case that there's a null byte in the metadata file of an app.
Therefore apps can grant themselves permissions without the consent of
the user. Flatpak shows permissions to the user during install by
reading them from the "xa.metadata" key in the commit metadata. This
cannot contain a null terminator, because it is an untrusted GVariant.
Flatpak compares these permissions to the *actual* metadata, from the
"metadata" file to ensure it wasn't lied to. However, the actual
metadata contents are loaded in several places where they are read as
simple C-style strings. That means that, if the metadata file includes
a null terminator, only the content of the file from *before* the
terminator gets compared to xa.metadata. Thus, any permissions that
appear in the metadata file after a null terminator are applied at
runtime but not shown to the user. So maliciously crafted apps can
give themselves hidden permissions. Users who have Flatpaks installed
from untrusted sources are at risk in case the Flatpak has a
maliciously crafted metadata file, either initially or in an update.
This issue is patched in versions 1.12.3 and 1.10.6. As a workaround,
users can manually check the permissions of installed apps by checking
the metadata file or the xa.metadata key on the commit metadata.

jQuery Terminal Emulator is a plugin for creating command line
interpreters in your applications. Versions prior to 2.31.1 contain a
low impact and limited cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The
code for XSS payload is always visible, but an attacker can use other
techniques to hide the code the victim sees. If the application uses
the `execHash` option and executes code from URL, the attacker can use
this URL to execute their code. The scope is limited because the
javascript attribute used is added to span tag, so no automatic
execution like with `onerror` on images is possible. This issue is
fixed in version 2.31.1. As a workaround, the user can use formatting
that wrap whole user input and its no op. The code for this workaround
is available in the GitHub Security Advisory. The fix will only work
when user of the library is not using different formatters (e.g. to
highlight code in different way).

The Nextcloud Android app is the Android client for Nextcloud, a self-
hosted productivity platform. The Nextcloud Android app uses content
providers to manage its data. Prior to version 3.18.1, the providers
`FileContentProvider` and `DiskLruImageCacheFileProvider` have
security issues (an SQL injection, and an insufficient permission
control, respectively) that allow malicious apps in the same device to
access Nextcloud's data bypassing the permission control system. Users
should upgrade to version 3.18.1 to receive a patch. There are no
known workarounds aside from upgrading.

The WP Travel plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.4.6. This is due to
missing or incorrect nonce validation on the save_meta_data()
function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to save
metadata for travel posts via a forged request granted they can trick
a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a
link.

<p>We have investigated reports of a spoofing vulnerability in AppX
installer that affects Microsoft Windows. Microsoft is aware of
attacks that attempt to exploit this vulnerability by using specially
crafted packages that include the malware family known as
Emotet/Trickbot/Bazaloader.</p> <p>An attacker could craft a malicious
attachment to be used in phishing campaigns. The attacker would then
have to convince the user to open the specially crafted attachment.
Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the
system could be less impacted than users who operate with
administrative user rights.</p> <p>Please see the <strong>Security
Updates</strong> table for the link to the updated app. Alternatively
you can download and install the Installer using the links provided in
the <strong>FAQ</strong> section.</p> <p>Please see the
<strong>Mitigations</strong> and <strong>Workaround</strong> sections
for important information about steps you can take to protect your
system from this vulnerability.</p> <p><strong>December 27 2023
Update:</strong></p> <p>In recent months, Microsoft Threat
Intelligence has seen an increase in activity from threat actors
leveraging social engineering and phishing techniques to target
Windows OS users and utilizing the <a
href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/app-
installer/installing-windows10-apps-web">ms-appinstaller URI
scheme</a>.</p> <p>To address this increase in activity, we have
updated the App Installer to disable the ms-appinstaller protocol by
default and recommend other potential mitigations.</p>

** DISPUTED ** Lorensbergs Connect2 3.13.7647.20190 is affected by an
XSS vulnerability. Exploitation requires administrator privileges and
is performed through the Wizard editor of the application. The attack
requires an administrator to go into the Wizard editor and enter an
XSS payload within the Page title, Page Instructions, Text before,
Text after, or Text on side box. Once this has been done, the
administrator must click save and finally wait until any user of the
application performs a booking for rental items in the booking area of
the application, where the XSS triggers. NOTE: another perspective is
that the administrator may require JavaScript to customize any aspect
of the page rendering. There is no effective way for the product to
defend users in the face of a malicious administrator.

** DISPUTED ** Styra Open Policy Agent (OPA) Gatekeeper through 3.7.0
mishandles concurrency, sometimes resulting in incorrect access
control. The data replication mechanism allows policies to access the
Kubernetes cluster state. During data replication, OPA/Gatekeeper does
not wait for the replication to finish before processing a request,
which might cause inconsistencies between the replicated resources in
OPA/Gatekeeper and the resources actually present in the cluster.
Inconsistency can later be reflected in a policy bypass. NOTE: the
vendor disagrees that this is a vulnerability, because Kubernetes
states are only eventually consistent.

The Edwiser Bridge plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
Request Forgery in versions up to, and including,2.0.6. This is due to
missing or incorrect nonce validation on the
user_data_synchronization_initiater(),
course_synchronization_initiater(),
users_link_to_moodle_synchronization(), connection_test_initiater(),
admin_menus(), and subscribe_handler() function. This makes it
possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform unauthorized actions
via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
performing an action such as clicking on a link.

Reference: URL:https://appcheck-ng.com/persistent-xss-kentico-cms/

The Kentico Xperience CMS version 13.0 &#8211; 13.0.43 is vulnerable to a
persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (also known as
Stored or Second-Order XSS). Persistent XSS vulnerabilities occur when
the application stores and retrieves client supplied data without
proper handling of dangerous content. This type of XSS vulnerability
is exploited by submitting malicious script content to the application
which is then retrieved and executed by other application users. The
attacker could exploit this to conduct a range of attacks against
users of the affected application such as session hijacking, account
take over and accessing sensitive data.

FreeRTOS versions 10.2.0 through 10.4.5 do not prevent non-kernel code
from calling the xPortRaisePrivilege internal function to raise
privilege. FreeRTOS versions through 10.4.6 do not prevent a third
party that has already independently gained the ability to execute
injected code to achieve further privilege escalation by branching
directly inside a FreeRTOS MPU API wrapper function with a manually
crafted stack frame. These issues affect ARMv7-M MPU ports, and
ARMv8-M ports with MPU support enabled (i.e. configENABLE_MPU set to
1). These are fixed in V10.5.0 and in V10.4.3-LTS Patch 3.

An issue was discovered in Reprise RLM 14.2. As the session cookies

bruteforcing the 4 hex-character session cookie on the Windows version
(the Linux version appears to have 8 characters). An attacker can

request to any page on the application (e.g., /goforms/menu) and
saving the name of the cookie sent with the response. The attacker can
then use the name of the cookie and try to request that same page,
setting a random value for the cookie. If any user has an active
