imapsync through 2.229 uses predictable paths under /tmp and /var/tmp
in its default mode of operation. Both of these are typically world-
writable, and thus (for example) an attacker can modify imapsync's
cache and overwrite files belonging to the user who runs it.

snowflake-connector-net, the Snowflake Connector for .NET, is
vulnerable to command injection prior to version 2.0.18 via SSO URL
authentication. In order to exploit the potential for command
injection, an attacker would need to be successful in (1) establishing
a malicious resource and (2) redirecting users to utilize the
resource. The attacker could set up a malicious, publicly accessible
server which responds to the SSO URL with an attack payload. If the
attacker then tricked a user into visiting the maliciously crafted
connection URL, the user&#8217;s local machine would render the malicious
payload, leading to a remote code execution. This attack scenario can
be mitigated through URL whitelisting as well as common anti-phishing
resources. Version 2.0.18 fixes this issue.

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development. By
frontrunning the creation of a proposal, an attacker can become the
proposer and gain the ability to cancel it. The attacker can do this
repeatedly to try to prevent a proposal from being proposed at all.
This impacts the `Governor` contract in v4.9.0 only, and the
`GovernorCompatibilityBravo` contract since v4.3.0. This problem has
been patched in 4.9.1 by introducing opt-in frontrunning protection.
Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade may submit the
proposal creation transaction to an endpoint with frontrunning
protection as a workaround.

Strapi is an open-source headless content management system. Prior to
version 4.10.8, it is possible to leak private fields if one is using
the `t(number)` prefix. Knex query allows users to change the default
prefix. For example, if someone changes the prefix to be the same as
it was before or to another table they want to query, the query
changes from `password` to `t1.password`. `password` is protected by
filtering protections but `t1.password` is not protected. This can
lead to filtering attacks on everything related to the object again,
including admin passwords and reset-tokens. Version 4.10.8 fixes this
issue.

Weave GitOps Terraform Controller (aka Weave TF-controller) is a
controller for Flux to reconcile Terraform resources in a GitOps way.
A vulnerability has been identified in Weave GitOps Terraform
Controller which could allow an authenticated remote attacker to view
sensitive information. This vulnerability stems from Weave GitOps
Terraform Runners (`tf-runner`), where sensitive data is inadvertently
printed - potentially revealing sensitive user data in their pod logs.
In particular, functions `tfexec.ShowPlan`, `tfexec.ShowPlanRaw`, and
`tfexec.Output` are implicated when the `tfexec` object set its
`Stdout` and `Stderr` to be `os.Stdout` and `os.Stderr`. An
unauthorized remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
accessing these prints of sensitive information, which may contain
configurations or tokens that could be used to gain unauthorized
control or access to resources managed by the Terraform controller. A
successful exploit could allow the attacker to utilize this sensitive
data, potentially leading to unauthorized access or control of the
system. This vulnerability has been addressed in Weave GitOps
Terraform Controller versions `v0.14.4` and `v0.15.0-rc.5`. Users are
urged to upgrade to one of these versions to mitigate the
vulnerability. As a temporary measure until the patch can be applied,
users can add the environment variable `DISABLE_TF_LOGS` to the tf-
runners via the runner pod template of the Terraform Custom Resource.
This will prevent the logging of sensitive information and mitigate
the risk of this vulnerability.

SABnzbd is an open source automated Usenet download tool. A design
flaw was discovered in SABnzbd that could allow remote code execution.
Manipulating the Parameters setting in the Notification Script
functionality allows code execution with the privileges of the SABnzbd
process. Exploiting the vulnerabilities requires access to the web
interface. Remote exploitation is possible if users[exposed their
setup to the internet or other untrusted networks without setting a
username/password. By default SABnzbd is only accessible from
`localhost`, with no authentication required for the web interface.
This issue has been patched in commits `e3a722` and `422b4f` which
have been included in the 4.0.2 release. Users are advised to upgrade.
Users unable to upgrade should ensure that a username and password
have been set if their instance is web accessible.

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React. The Gatsby
framework prior to versions 4.25.7 and 5.9.1 contain a Local File
Inclusion vulnerability in the `__file-code-frame` and `__original-
stack-frame` paths, exposed when running the Gatsby develop server
(`gatsby develop`). Any file in scope of the development server could
potentially be exposed. It should be noted that by default `gatsby
develop` is only accessible via the localhost `127.0.0.1`, and one
would need to intentionally expose the server to other interfaces to
exploit this vulnerability by using server options such as `--host
0.0.0.0`, `-H 0.0.0.0`, or the `GATSBY_HOST=0.0.0.0` environment
variable. A patch has been introduced in `gatsby@5.9.1` and
`gatsby@4.25.7` which mitigates the issue. Users are advised to
upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should avoid exposing their
development server to the internet.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/06/26/1

OpenPrinting CUPS is a standards-based, open source printing system
for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Starting in version
2.0.0 and prior to version 2.4.6, CUPS logs data of free memory to the
logging service AFTER the connection has been closed, when it should
have logged the data right before. This is a use-after-free bug that
impacts the entire cupsd process. The exact cause of this issue is the
function `httpClose(con->http)` being called in `scheduler/client.c`.
The problem is that httpClose always, provided its argument is not
null, frees the pointer at the end of the call, only for
cupsdLogClient to pass the pointer to httpGetHostname. This issue
happens in function `cupsdAcceptClient` if LogLevel is warn or higher
and in two scenarios: there is a double-lookup for the IP Address
(HostNameLookups Double is set in `cupsd.conf`) which fails to
resolve, or if CUPS is compiled with TCP wrappers and the connection
is refused by rules from `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny`.
Version 2.4.6 has a patch for this issue.

Cilium is a networking, observability, and security solution with an
eBPF-based dataplane. Prior to version 1.13.4, when Gateway API is
enabled in Cilium, the absence of a check on the namespace in which a
ReferenceGrant is created could result in Cilium unintentionally
gaining visibility of secrets (including certificates) and services
across namespaces. An attacker on an affected cluster can leverage
this issue to use cluster secrets that should not be visible to them,
or communicate with services that they should not have access to.
Gateway API functionality is disabled by default. This vulnerability
is fixed in Cilium release 1.13.4. As a workaround, restrict the
creation of `ReferenceGrant` resources to admin users by using
Kubernetes RBAC.

Grav is a flat-file content management system. Prior to version
1.7.42, there is a logic flaw in the `GravExtension.filterFilter()`
function whereby validation against a denylist of unsafe functions is
only performed when the argument passed to filter is a string.
However, passing an array as a callable argument allows the validation
check to be skipped. Consequently, a low privileged attacker with
login access to Grav Admin panel and page creation/update permissions
is able to inject malicious templates to obtain remote code execution.
The vulnerability can be found in the `GravExtension.filterFilter()`
function declared in
`/system/src/Grav/Common/Twig/Extension/GravExtension.php`. Version
1.7.42 contains a patch for this issue. End users should also ensure
that `twig.undefined_functions` and `twig.undefined_filters`
properties in `/path/to/webroot/system/config/system.yaml`
configuration file are set to `false` to disallow Twig from treating
undefined filters/functions as PHP functions and executing them.

Grav is a flat-file content management system. Prior to version
1.7.42, the denylist introduced in commit 9d6a2d to prevent dangerous
functions from being executed via injection of malicious templates was
insufficient and could be easily subverted in multiple ways -- (1)
using unsafe functions that are not banned, (2) using capitalised
callable names, and (3) using fully-qualified names for referencing
callables. Consequently, a low privileged attacker with login access
to Grav Admin panel and page creation/update permissions is able to
inject malicious templates to obtain remote code execution. A patch in
version 1.7.42 improves the denylist.

The GLPI Agent is a generic management agent. Prior to version 1.5, if
glpi-agent is running remoteinventory task against an Unix platform
with ssh command, an administrator user on the remote can manage to
inject a command in a specific workflow the agent would run with the
privileges it uses. In the case, the agent is running with
administration privileges, a malicious user could gain high privileges
on the computer glpi-agent is running on. A malicious user could also
disclose all remote accesses the agent is configured with for
remoteinventory task. This vulnerability has been patched in glpi-
agent 1.5.

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel before
6.3.3. There is an out-of-bounds read in crc16 in lib/crc16.c when
called from fs/ext4/super.c because ext4_group_desc_csum does not
properly check an offset. NOTE: this is disputed by third parties
because the kernel is not intended to defend against attackers with
the stated "When modifying the block device while it is mounted by the
filesystem" access.

Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://www.errno.fr/PatrolAdvisory.html#remote-code-excution-using-patrols-pconfig

** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in BMC Patrol through 23.1.00.
The agent's configuration can be remotely modified (and, by default,
authentication is not required). Some configuration fields related to
SNMP (e.g., masterAgentName or masterAgentStartLine) result in code
execution when the agent is restarted. NOTE: the vendor's perspective
is "These are not vulnerabilities for us as we have provided the
option to implement the authentication."

The Salon Booking System plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-
Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.4.6. This is
due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'save_customer'
function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
change the admin role to customer or change the user meta to arbitrary
values via a forged request, granted they can trick a site
administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

The fix for XSA-423 added logic to Linux'es netback driver to deal
with a frontend splitting a packet in a way such that not all of the
headers would come in one piece. Unfortunately the logic introduced
there didn't account for the extreme case of the entire packet being
split into as many pieces as permitted by the protocol, yet still
being smaller than the area that's specially dealt with to keep all
(possible) headers together. Such an unusual packet would therefore
trigger a buffer overrun in the driver.

Arm provides multiple helpers to clean & invalidate the cache for a
given region. This is, for instance, used when allocating guest memory
to ensure any writes (such as the ones during scrubbing) have reached
memory before handing over the page to a guest. Unfortunately, the
arithmetics in the helpers can overflow and would then result to skip
the cache cleaning/invalidation. Therefore there is no guarantee when
all the writes will reach the memory.

For migration as well as to work around kernels unaware of L1TF (see
XSA-273), PV guests may be run in shadow paging mode. Since Xen itself
needs to be mapped when PV guests run, Xen and shadowed PV guests run
directly the respective shadow page tables. For 64-bit PV guests this
means running on the shadow of the guest root page table. In the
course of dealing with shortage of memory in the shadow pool
associated with a domain, shadows of page tables may be torn down.
This tearing down may include the shadow root page table that the CPU
in question is presently running on. While a precaution exists to
supposedly prevent the tearing down of the underlying live page table,
the time window covered by that precaution isn't large enough.

When a transaction is committed, C Xenstored will first check the
quota is correct before attempting to commit any nodes. It would be
possible that accounting is temporarily negative if a node has been
removed outside of the transaction. Unfortunately, some versions of C
Xenstored are assuming that the quota cannot be negative and are using
assert() to confirm it. This will lead to C Xenstored crash when tools
are built without -DNDEBUG (this is the default).

Closing of an event channel in the Linux kernel can result in a
deadlock. This happens when the close is being performed in parallel
to an unrelated Xen console action and the handling of a Xen console
interrupt in an unprivileged guest. The closing of an event channel is
e.g. triggered by removal of a paravirtual device on the other side.
As this action will cause console messages to be issued on the other
side quite often, the chance of triggering the deadlock is not
neglectable. Note that 32-bit Arm-guests are not affected, as the
32-bit Linux kernel on Arm doesn't use queued-RW-locks, which are
required to trigger the issue (on Arm32 a waiting writer doesn't block
further readers to get the lock).

libfsimage contains parsing code for several filesystems, most of them
based on grub-legacy code. libfsimage is used by pygrub to inspect
guest disks. Pygrub runs as the same user as the toolstack (root in a
priviledged domain). At least one issue has been reported to the Xen
Security Team that allows an attacker to trigger a stack buffer
overflow in libfsimage. After further analisys the Xen Security Team
is no longer confident in the suitability of libfsimage when run
against guest controlled input with super user priviledges. In order
to not affect current deployments that rely on pygrub patches are
provided in the resolution section of the advisory that allow running
pygrub in deprivileged mode. CVE-2023-4949 refers to the original
issue in the upstream grub project ("An attacker with local access to
a system (either through a disk or external drive) can present a
modified XFS partition to grub-legacy in such a way to exploit a
memory corruption in grub&#8217;s XFS file system implementation.")
CVE-2023-34325 refers specifically to the vulnerabilities in Xen's
copy of libfsimage, which is decended from a very old version of grub.

The caching invalidation guidelines from the AMD-Vi specification
(48882&#8212;Rev 3.07-PUB&#8212;Oct 2022) is incorrect on some hardware, as
devices will malfunction (see stale DMA mappings) if some fields of
the DTE are updated but the IOMMU TLB is not flushed. Such stale DMA
mappings can point to memory ranges not owned by the guest, thus
allowing access to unindented memory regions.

An issue was discovered in Progress DataDirect Connect for ODBC before

encryption, if an error is encountered initializing the encryption
object used to encrypt data, the code falls back to a different
encryption mechanism that uses an insecure random number generator to
generate the private key. It is possible for a well-placed attacker to
predict the output of this random number generator, which could lead
to an attacker decrypting traffic between the driver and the database
server. The vulnerability does not exist if SSL / TLS encryption is
used.

The error page for sites with invalid TLS certificates was missing the
activation-delay Firefox uses to protect prompts and permission
dialogs from attacks that exploit human response time delays. If a
malicious page elicited user clicks in precise locations immediately
before navigating to a site with a certificate error and made the
renderer extremely busy at the same time, it could create a gap
between when the error page was loaded and when the display actually
refreshed. With the right timing the elicited clicks could land in
that gap and activate the button that overrides the certificate error
for that site. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 102.12,
Firefox < 114, and Thunderbird < 102.12.

document in the same process as the site that issued the redirect.
This bypassed the site-isolation protections against Spectre-like

follows HTTP redirects to data: URLs. This vulnerability affects
Firefox < 114.

CometBFT is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a
state transition machine and replicates it on many machines. An
internal modification made in versions 0.34.28 and 0.37.1 to the way
struct `PeerState` is serialized to JSON introduced a deadlock when
new function MarshallJSON is called. This function can be called from
two places. The first is via logs, setting the `consensus` logging
module to "debug" level (should not happen in production), and setting
the log output format to JSON. The second is via RPC
`dump_consensus_state`. Case 1, which should not be hit in production,
will eventually hit the deadlock in most goroutines, effectively
halting the node. In case 2, only the data structures related to the
first peer will be deadlocked, together with the thread(s) dealing
with the RPC request(s). This means that only one of the channels of
communication to the node's peers will be blocked. Eventually the peer
will timeout and excluded from the list (typically after 2 minutes).
The goroutines involved in the deadlock will not be garbage collected,
but they will not interfere with the system after the peer is
excluded. The theoretical worst case for case 2, is a network with
only two validator nodes. In this case, each of the nodes only has one
`PeerState` struct. If `dump_consensus_state` is called in either node
(or both), the chain will halt until the peer connections time out,
after which the nodes will reconnect (with different `PeerState`
structs) and the chain will progress again. Then, the same process can
be repeated. As the number of nodes in a network increases, and thus,
the number of peer struct each node maintains, the possibility of
reproducing the perturbation visible with two nodes decreases. Only
the first `PeerState` struct will deadlock, and not the others (RPC
`dump_consensus_state` accesses them in a for loop, so the deadlock at
the first iteration causes the rest of the iterations of that "for"
loop to never be reached). This regression was fixed in versions
0.34.29 and 0.37.2. Some workarounds are available. For case 1
(hitting the deadlock via logs), either don't set the log output to
"json", leave at "plain", or don't set the consensus logging module to
"debug", leave it at "info" or higher. For case 2 (hitting the
deadlock via RPC `dump_consensus_state`), do not expose
`dump_consensus_state` RPC endpoint to the public internet (e.g., via
rules in one's nginx setup).

CometBFT is a Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) middleware that takes a
state transition machine and replicates it on many machines. The
mempool maintains two data structures to keep track of outstanding
transactions: a list and a map. These two data structures are supposed
to be in sync all the time in the sense that the map tracks the index
(if any) of the transaction in the list. In `v0.37.0`, and `v0.37.1`,
as well as in `v0.34.28`, and all previous releases of the CometBFT
repo2, it is possible to have them out of sync. When this happens, the
list may contain several copies of the same transaction. Because the
map tracks a single index, it is then no longer possible to remove all
the copies of the transaction from the list. This happens even if the
duplicated transaction is later committed in a block. The only way to
remove the transaction is by restarting the node. The above problem
can be repeated on and on until a sizable number of transactions are
stuck in the mempool, in order to try to bring down the target node.
The problem is fixed in releases `v0.34.29` and `v0.37.2`. Some
workarounds are available. Increasing the value of `cache_size` in
`config.toml` makes it very difficult to effectively attack a full
node. Not exposing the transaction submission RPC's would mitigate the
probability of a successful attack, as the attacker would then have to
create a modified (byzantine) full node to be able to perform the
attack via p2p.

snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to
unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions
prior to 1.1.10.1, causing a fatal error. The function `shuffle(int[]
input)` in the file `BitShuffle.java` receives an array of integers
and applies a bit shuffle on it. It does so by multiplying the length
by 4 and passing it to the natively compiled shuffle function. Since
the length is not tested, the multiplication by four can cause an
integer overflow and become a smaller value than the true size, or
even zero or negative. In the case of a negative value, a
`java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will raise, which can
crash the program. In a case of a value that is zero or too small, the
code that afterwards references the shuffled array will assume a
bigger size of the array, which might cause exceptions such as
`java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The same issue exists also
when using the `shuffle` functions that receive a double, float, long
and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the same
issue. Version 1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.

snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to
unchecked multiplications, an integer overflow may occur in versions
prior to 1.1.10.1, causing an unrecoverable fatal error. The function
`compress(char[] input)` in the file `Snappy.java` receives an array
of characters and compresses it. It does so by multiplying the length
by 2 and passing it to the rawCompress` function. Since the length is
not tested, the multiplication by two can cause an integer overflow
and become negative. The rawCompress function then uses the received
length and passes it to the natively compiled maxCompressedLength
function, using the returned value to allocate a byte array. Since the
maxCompressedLength function treats the length as an unsigned integer,
it doesn&#8217;t care that it is negative, and it returns a valid value,
which is casted to a signed integer by the Java engine. If the result
is negative, a `java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception will
be raised while trying to allocate the array `buf`. On the other side,
if the result is positive, the `buf` array will successfully be
allocated, but its size might be too small to use for the compression,
causing a fatal Access Violation error. The same issue exists also
when using the `compress` functions that receive double, float, int,
long and short, each using a different multiplier that may cause the
same issue. The issue most likely won&#8217;t occur when using a byte array,
since creating a byte array of size 0x80000000 (or any other negative
value) is impossible in the first place. Version 1.1.10.1 contains a
patch for this issue.

snappy-java is a fast compressor/decompressor for Java. Due to use of
an unchecked chunk length, an unrecoverable fatal error can occur in
versions prior to 1.1.10.1. The code in the function hasNextChunk in
the fileSnappyInputStream.java checks if a given stream has more
chunks to read. It does that by attempting to read 4 bytes. If it
wasn&#8217;t possible to read the 4 bytes, the function returns false.
Otherwise, if 4 bytes were available, the code treats them as the
length of the next chunk. In the case that the `compressed` variable
is null, a byte array is allocated with the size given by the input
data. Since the code doesn&#8217;t test the legality of the `chunkSize`
variable, it is possible to pass a negative number (such as 0xFFFFFFFF
which is -1), which will cause the code to raise a
`java.lang.NegativeArraySizeException` exception. A worse case would
happen when passing a huge positive value (such as 0x7FFFFFFF), which
would raise the fatal `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` error. Version
1.1.10.1 contains a patch for this issue.

mx-chain-go is the official implementation of the MultiversX
blockchain protocol, written in golang. When executing a relayed
transaction, if the inner transaction failed, it would have increased
the inner transaction's sender account nonce. This could have
contributed to a limited DoS attack on a targeted account. The fix is
a breaking change so a new flag `RelayedNonceFixEnableEpoch` was
needed. This was a strict processing issue while validating blocks on
a chain. This vulnerability has been patched in version 1.4.17.

OpenZeppelin Contracts is a library for smart contract development.
Starting in version 4.7.0 and prior to version 4.9.2, when the
`verifyMultiProof`, `verifyMultiProofCalldata`,
`procesprocessMultiProof`, or `processMultiProofCalldat` functions are
in use, it is possible to construct merkle trees that allow forging a
valid multiproof for an arbitrary set of leaves. A contract may be
vulnerable if it uses multiproofs for verification and the merkle tree
that is processed includes a node with value 0 at depth 1 (just under
the root). This could happen inadvertedly for balanced trees with 3
leaves or less, if the leaves are not hashed. This could happen
deliberately if a malicious tree builder includes such a node in the
tree. A contract is not vulnerable if it uses single-leaf proving
(`verify`, `verifyCalldata`, `processProof`, or
`processProofCalldata`), or if it uses multiproofs with a known tree
that has hashed leaves. Standard merkle trees produced or validated
with the @openzeppelin/merkle-tree library are safe. The problem has
been patched in version 4.9.2. Some workarounds are available. For
those using multiproofs: When constructing merkle trees hash the
leaves and do not insert empty nodes in your trees. Using the
@openzeppelin/merkle-tree package eliminates this issue. Do not accept
user-provided merkle roots without reconstructing at least the first
level of the tree. Verify the merkle tree structure by reconstructing
it from the leaves.

Issue summary: Checking excessively long DH keys or parameters may be
very slow. Impact summary: Applications that use the functions
DH_check(), DH_check_ex() or EVP_PKEY_param_check() to check a DH key
or DH parameters may experience long delays. Where the key or
parameters that are being checked have been obtained from an untrusted
source this may lead to a Denial of Service. The function DH_check()
performs various checks on DH parameters. One of those checks confirms
that the modulus ('p' parameter) is not too large. Trying to use a
very large modulus is slow and OpenSSL will not normally use a modulus
which is over 10,000 bits in length. However the DH_check() function
checks numerous aspects of the key or parameters that have been
supplied. Some of those checks use the supplied modulus value even if
it has already been found to be too large. An application that calls
DH_check() and supplies a key or parameters obtained from an untrusted
source could be vulernable to a Denial of Service attack. The function
DH_check() is itself called by a number of other OpenSSL functions. An
application calling any of those other functions may similarly be
affected. The other functions affected by this are DH_check_ex() and
EVP_PKEY_param_check(). Also vulnerable are the OpenSSL dhparam and
pkeyparam command line applications when using the '-check' option.
The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The
OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are not affected by this issue.

Tauri is a framework for building binaries for all major desktop
platforms. The 1.4.0 release includes a regression on the Filesystem
scope check for dotfiles on Unix. Previously dotfiles were not
implicitly allowed by the glob wildcard scopes (eg. `$HOME/*`), but a
regression was introduced when a configuration option for this
behavior was implemented. Only Tauri applications using wildcard
scopes in the `fs` endpoint are affected. The regression has been
patched on version 1.4.1.

PyBB is an open source bulletin board. A manual code review of the
PyBB bulletin board server has revealed that a vulnerability could
have been exploited in which users could submit any type of HTML tag,
and have said tag run. For example, a malicious `<a>` that looks like
```<a href=javascript:alert (1)>xss</a>``` could have been used to run
code through JavaScript on the client side. The problem has been
patched as of commit `5defd92`, and users are advised to upgrade.
Attackers do need posting privilege in order to exploit this
vulnerability. This vulnerability is present within the 0.1.0 release,
and users are advised to upgrade to 0.1.1. Users unable to upgrade may
be able to work around the attack by either; Removing the ability to
create posts, removing the `|safe` tag from the Jinja2 template titled
"post.html" in templates or by adding manual validation of links in
the post creation section.

Netty is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework
for rapid development of maintainable high performance protocol
servers & clients. The `SniHandler` can allocate up to 16MB of heap
for each channel during the TLS handshake. When the handler or the
channel does not have an idle timeout, it can be used to make a TCP
server using the `SniHandler` to allocate 16MB of heap. The
`SniHandler` class is a handler that waits for the TLS handshake to
configure a `SslHandler` according to the indicated server name by the
`ClientHello` record. For this matter it allocates a `ByteBuf` using
the value defined in the `ClientHello` record. Normally the value of
the packet should be smaller than the handshake packet but there are
not checks done here and the way the code is written, it is possible
to craft a packet that makes the `SslClientHelloHandler`. This
vulnerability has been fixed in version 4.1.94.Final.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. Starting in version 2.2.1 until
versions 14.4.8, 14.10.5, and 15.1RC1 of org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-
platform-web and any version prior to 14.4.8, 14.10.5, and 15.1.RC1 of
org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates, any user who can edit
a document in a wiki like the user profile can create a stored cross-
site scripting attack. The attack occurs by putting plain HTML code
into that document and then tricking another user to visit that
document with the `displaycontent` or `rendercontent` template and
plain output syntax. If a user with programming rights is tricked into
visiting such a URL, arbitrary actions be performed with this user's
rights, impacting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
the whole XWiki installation. This has been patched in XWiki 14.4.8,
14.10.5 and 15.1RC1 by setting the content type of the response to
plain text when the output syntax is not an HTML syntax.

Specific F5 BIG-IP platforms with Cavium Nitrox FIPS HSM cards
generate a deterministic password for the Crypto User account. The
predictable nature of the password allows an authenticated user with
TMSH access to the BIG-IP system, or anyone with physical access to
the FIPS HSM, the information required to generate the correct
password. On vCMP systems, all Guests share the same deterministic
password, allowing those with TMSH access on one Guest to access keys
of a different Guest. The following BIG-IP hardware platforms are
affected: 10350v-F, i5820-DF, i7820-DF, i15820-DF, 5250v-F, 7200v-F,
10200v-F, 6900-F, 8900-F, 11000-F, and 11050-F. The BIG-IP rSeries
r5920-DF and r10920-DF are not affected, nor does the issue affect
software FIPS implementations or network HSM configurations. Note:
Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS)

Insecure defaults in open-source Temporal Server before version 1.20
on all platforms allows an attacker to craft a task token with access
to a namespace other than the one specified in the request. Creation
of this task token must be done outside of the normal Temporal server
flow. It requires the namespace UUID and information from the workflow
history for the target namespace. Under these conditions, it is
possible to interfere with pending tasks in other namespaces, such as
marking a task failed or completed. If a task is targeted for
completion by the attacker, the targeted namespace must also be using
the same data converter configuration as the initial, valid, namespace
for the task completion payload to be decoded by workers in the target
namespace.

Reference: URL:https://security.FreeBSD.org/advisories/FreeBSD-SA-23:07.bhyve.asc

The fwctl driver implements a state machine which is executed when a
bhyve guest accesses certain x86 I/O ports. The interface lets the
guest copy a string into a buffer resident in the bhyve process'
memory. A bug in the state machine implementation can result in a
buffer overflowing when copying this string. Malicious, privileged
software running in a guest VM can exploit the buffer overflow to
achieve code execution on the host in the bhyve userspace process,
which typically runs as root, mitigated by the capabilities assigned
through the Capsicum sandbox available to the bhyve process.

An infinite loop vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service
for Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets sent by the
client, the core unmarshalling function sl_unpack_loop() did not
validate a field in the network packet that contains the count of
elements in an array-like structure. By passing 0 as the count value,
the attacked function will run in an endless loop consuming 100% CPU.
This flaw allows an attacker to issue a malformed RPC request,
triggering an infinite loop, resulting in a denial of service
condition.

A Type Confusion vulnerability was found in Samba's mdssvc RPC service
for Spotlight. When parsing Spotlight mdssvc RPC packets, one encoded
data structure is a key-value style dictionary where the keys are
character strings, and the values can be any of the supported types in
the mdssvc protocol. Due to a lack of type checking in callers of the
dalloc_value_for_key() function, which returns the object associated
with a key, a caller may trigger a crash in talloc_get_size() when
talloc detects that the passed-in pointer is not a valid talloc
pointer. With an RPC worker process shared among multiple client
connections, a malicious client or attacker can trigger a process
crash in a shared RPC mdssvc worker process, affecting all other
clients this worker serves.

D-Bus before 1.15.6 sometimes allows unprivileged users to crash dbus-
daemon. If a privileged user with control over the dbus-daemon is
using the org.freedesktop.DBus.Monitoring interface to monitor message
bus traffic, then an unprivileged user with the ability to connect to
the same dbus-daemon can cause a dbus-daemon crash under some
circumstances via an unreplyable message. When done on the well-known
system bus, this is a denial-of-service vulnerability. The fixed
versions are 1.12.28, 1.14.8, and 1.15.6.

Vega is a decentralized trading platform that allows pseudo-anonymous
trading of derivatives on a blockchain. Prior to version 0.71.6, a
vulnerability exists that allows a malicious validator to trick the
Vega network into re-processing past Ethereum events from Vega&#8217;s
Ethereum bridge. For example, a deposit to the collateral bridge for
100USDT that credits a party&#8217;s general account on Vega, can be re-
processed 50 times resulting in 5000USDT in that party&#8217;s general
account. This is without depositing any more than the original 100USDT
on the bridge. Despite this exploit requiring access to a validator's
Vega key, a validator key can be obtained at the small cost of
3000VEGA, the amount needed to announce a new node onto the network. A
patch is available in version 0.71.6. No known workarounds are
available, however there are mitigations in place should this
vulnerability be exploited. There are monitoring alerts for `mainnet1`
in place to identify any issues of this nature including this
vulnerability being exploited. The validators have the ability to stop
the bridge thus stopping any withdrawals should this vulnerability be
exploited.

AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK) is an open-source software
development framework to define cloud infrastructure in code and
provision it through AWS CloudFormation. In the packages `aws-cdk-lib`
2.0.0 until 2.80.0 and `@aws-cdk/aws-eks` 1.57.0 until 1.202.0,
`eks.Cluster` and `eks.FargateCluster` constructs create two roles,
`CreationRole` and `default MastersRole`, that have an overly
permissive trust policy. The first, referred to as the `CreationRole`,
is used by lambda handlers to create the cluster and deploy Kubernetes
resources (e.g `KubernetesManifest`, `HelmChart`, ...) onto it. Users
with CDK version higher or equal to 1.62.0 (including v2 users) may be
affected. The second, referred to as the `default MastersRole`, is
provisioned only if the `mastersRole` property isn't provided and has
permissions to execute `kubectl` commands on the cluster. Users with
CDK version higher or equal to 1.57.0 (including v2 users) may be
affected. The issue has been fixed in `@aws-cdk/aws-eks` v1.202.0 and
`aws-cdk-lib` v2.80.0. These versions no longer use the account root
principal. Instead, they restrict the trust policy to the specific
roles of lambda handlers that need it. There is no workaround
available for CreationRole. To avoid creating the `default
MastersRole`, use the `mastersRole` property to explicitly provide a
role.

data, an attacker who knows the `id` of an entity instance is not
authorized to access, can gain read, update and delete access to it.
The issue is fixed in version 0.20.6. As a workaround, set the
`apiPrefilter` option to a filter object instead of a function.

PHP-IMAP is a wrapper for common IMAP communication without the need
to have the php-imap module installed / enabled. Prior to version
5.3.0, an unsanitized attachment filename allows any unauthenticated
user to leverage a directory traversal vulnerability, which results in
a remote code execution vulnerability. Every application that stores
attachments with `Attachment::save()` without providing a `$filename`
or passing unsanitized user input is affected by this attack. An
attacker can send an email with a malicious attachment to the inbox,
which gets crawled with `webklex/php-imap` or `webklex/laravel-imap`.
Prerequisite for the vulnerability is that the script stores the
attachments without providing a `$filename`, or providing an
unsanitized `$filename`, in `src/Attachment::save(string $path, string
$filename = null)`. In this case, where no `$filename` gets passed
into the `Attachment::save()` method, the package would use a series
of unsanitized and insecure input values from the mail as fallback.
Even if a developer passes a `$filename` into the `Attachment::save()`
method, e.g. by passing the name or filename of the mail attachment
itself (from email headers), the input values never get sanitized by
the package. There is also no restriction about the file extension
(e.g. ".php") or the contents of a file. This allows an attacker to
upload malicious code of any type and content at any location where
the underlying user has write permissions. The attacker can also
overwrite existing files and inject malicious code into files that,
e.g. get executed by the system via cron or requests. Version 5.3.0
contains a patch for this issue.

In Suricata before 6.0.13 (when there is an adversary who controls an
external source of rules), a dataset filename, that comes from a rule,
may trigger absolute or relative directory traversal, and lead to
write access to a local filesystem. This is addressed in 6.0.13 by
requiring allow-absolute-filenames and allow-write (in the datasets
rules configuration section) if an installation requires
traversal/writing in this situation.

Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals. The
Backstage scaffolder-backend plugin uses a templating library that
requires sandbox, as it by design allows for code injection. The
library used for this sandbox so far has been `vm2`, but in light of
several past vulnerabilities and existing vulnerabilities that may not
have a fix, the plugin has switched to using a different sandbox
library. A malicious actor with write access to a registered
scaffolder template could manipulate the template in a way that allows
for remote code execution on the scaffolder-backend instance. This was
only exploitable in the template YAML definition itself and not by
user input data. This is vulnerability is fixed in version 1.15.0 of
`@backstage/plugin-scaffolder-backend`.

SpiceDB is an open source, Google Zanzibar-inspired, database system
for creating and managing security-critical application permissions.
Any user making a negative authorization decision based on the results
of a `LookupResources` request with 1.22.0 is affected. For example,
using `LookupResources` to find a list of resources to allow access to
be okay: some subjects that should have access to a resource may not.
But if using `LookupResources` to find a list of banned resources
instead, then some users that shouldn't have access may. Generally,
`LookupResources` is not and should not be to gate access in this way
- that's what the `Check` API is for. Additionally, version 1.22.0 has
included a warning about this bug since its initial release. Users are
advised to upgrade to version 1.22.2. Users unable to upgrade should
avoid using `LookupResources` for negative authorization decisions.

jcvi is a Python library to facilitate genome assembly, annotation,
and comparative genomics. A configuration injection happens when user
input is considered by the application in an unsanitized format and
can reach the configuration file. A malicious user may craft a special
payload that may lead to a command injection. The impact of a
configuration injection may vary. Under some conditions, it may lead
to command injection if there is for instance shell code execution
from the configuration file values. This vulnerability does not
currently have a fix.

yt-dlp is a command-line program to download videos from video sites.
During file downloads, yt-dlp or the external downloaders that yt-dlp
employs may leak cookies on HTTP redirects to a different host, or
leak them when the host for download fragments differs from their
parent manifest's host. This vulnerable behavior is present in yt-dlp
prior to 2023.07.06 and nightly 2023.07.06.185519. All native and
external downloaders are affected, except for `curl` and `httpie`
(version 3.1.0 or later). At the file download stage, all cookies are
passed by yt-dlp to the file downloader as a `Cookie` header, thereby
losing their scope. This also occurs in yt-dlp's info JSON output,
which may be used by external tools. As a result, the downloader or
external tool may indiscriminately send cookies with requests to
domains or paths for which the cookies are not scoped. yt-dlp version
2023.07.06 and nightly 2023.07.06.185519 fix this issue by removing
the `Cookie` header upon HTTP redirects; having native downloaders
calculate the `Cookie` header from the cookiejar, utilizing external
downloaders' built-in support for cookies instead of passing them as
header arguments, disabling HTTP redirectiong if the external
downloader does not have proper cookie support, processing cookies
passed as HTTP headers to limit their scope, and having a separate
field for cookies in the info dict storing more information about
scoping Some workarounds are available for those who are unable to
upgrade. Avoid using cookies and user authentication methods. While
extractors may set custom cookies, these usually do not contain
sensitive information. Alternatively, avoid using `--load-info-json`.
Or, if authentication is a must: verify the integrity of download
links from unknown sources in browser (including redirects) before
passing them to yt-dlp; use `curl` as external downloader, since it is
not impacted; and/or avoid fragmented formats such as HLS/m3u8,
DASH/mpd and ISM.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/07/msg00029.html

Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to
another, and a command-line tool that uses this library. Starting in
version 1.13 and prior to version 3.1.4, Pandoc is susceptible to an
arbitrary file write vulnerability, which can be triggered by
providing a specially crafted image element in the input when
generating files using the `--extract-media` option or outputting to
PDF format. This vulnerability allows an attacker to create or
overwrite arbitrary files on the system ,depending on the privileges
of the process running pandoc. It only affects systems that pass
untrusted user input to pandoc and allow pandoc to be used to produce
a PDF or with the `--extract-media` option. The fix is to unescape the
percent-encoding prior to checking that the resource is not above the
working directory, and prior to extracting the extension. Some code
for checking that the path is below the working directory was flawed
in a similar way and has also been fixed. Note that the `--sandbox`
option, which only affects IO done by readers and writers themselves,
does not block this vulnerability. The vulnerability is patched in
pandoc 3.1.4. As a workaround, audit the pandoc command and disallow
PDF output and the `--extract-media` option.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support
for multi-language development. When Gradle writes a dependency into
its dependency cache, it uses the dependency's coordinates to compute
a file location. With specially crafted dependency coordinates, Gradle
can be made to write files into an unintended location. The file may
be written outside the dependency cache or over another file in the
dependency cache. This vulnerability could be used to poison the
dependency cache or overwrite important files elsewhere on the
filesystem where the Gradle process has write permissions. Exploiting
this vulnerability requires an attacker to have control over a
dependency repository used by the Gradle build or have the ability to
modify the build's configuration. It is unlikely that this would go
unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect
against this vulnerability. Gradle will refuse to cache dependencies
that have path traversal elements in their dependency coordinates. It
is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version. If you are
unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.6.2 or 8.2, `dependency verification`
will make this vulnerability more difficult to exploit.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support
for multi-language development. In affected versions when unpacking
Tar archives, Gradle did not check that files could be written outside
of the unpack location. This could lead to important files being
overwritten anywhere the Gradle process has write permissions. For a
build reading Tar entries from a Tar archive, this issue could allow
Gradle to disclose information from sensitive files through an
arbitrary file read. To exploit this behavior, an attacker needs to
either control the source of an archive already used by the build or
modify the build to interact with a malicious archive. It is unlikely
that this would go unnoticed. A fix has been released in Gradle 7.6.2
and 8.2 to protect against this vulnerability. Starting from these
versions, Gradle will refuse to handle Tar archives which contain path
traversal elements in a Tar entry name. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability. ### Impact This
is a path traversal vulnerability when Gradle deals with Tar archives,
often referenced as TarSlip, a variant of ZipSlip. * When unpacking
Tar archives, Gradle did not check that files could be written outside
of the unpack location. This could lead to important files being
overwritten anywhere the Gradle process has write permissions. * For a
build reading Tar entries from a Tar archive, this issue could allow
Gradle to disclose information from sensitive files through an
arbitrary file read. To exploit this behavior, an attacker needs to
either control the source of an archive already used by the build or
modify the build to interact with a malicious archive. It is unlikely
that this would go unnoticed. Gradle uses Tar archives for its [Build
Cache](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/build_cache.html).
These archives are safe when created by Gradle. But if an attacker had
control of a remote build cache server, they could inject malicious
build cache entries that leverage this vulnerability. This attack
vector could also be exploited if a man-in-the-middle can be performed
between the remote cache and the build. ### Patches A fix has been
released in Gradle 7.6.2 and 8.2 to protect against this
vulnerability. Starting from these versions, Gradle will refuse to
handle Tar archives which contain path traversal elements in a Tar
entry name. It is recommended that users upgrade to a patched version.
### Workarounds There is no workaround. * If your build deals with Tar
archives that you do not fully trust, you need to inspect them to
confirm they do not attempt to leverage this vulnerability. * If you
use the Gradle remote build cache, make sure only trusted parties have
write access to it and that connections to the remote cache are
properly secured. ### References * [CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a

Novu provides an API for sending notifications through multiple
channels. Versions prior to 0.16.0 contain an open redirect
vulnerability in the "Sign In with GitHub" functionality of Novu's
open-source repository. It could have allowed an attacker to force a
victim into opening a malicious URL and thus, potentially log into the
repository under the victim's account gaining full control of the
account. This vulnerability only affected the Novu Cloud and Open-
Source deployments if the user manually enabled the GitHub OAuth on
their self-hosted instance of Novu. Users should upgrade to version
0.16.0 to receive a patch.

A missing allocation check in sftp server processing read requests may
cause a NULL dereference on low-memory conditions. The malicious
client can request up to 4GB SFTP reads, causing allocation of up to
4GB buffers, which was not being checked for failure. This will likely
crash the authenticated user's sftp server connection (if implemented
as forking as recommended). For thread-based servers, this might also
cause DoS for legitimate users. Given this code is not in any released
versions, no security releases have been issued.

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel's net/sched:
cls_u32 component can be exploited to achieve local privilege
escalation. If tcf_change_indev() fails, u32_set_parms() will
immediately return an error after incrementing or decrementing the
reference counter in tcf_bind_filter(). If an attacker can control the
reference counter and set it to zero, they can cause the reference to
be freed, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. We recommend
upgrading past commit 04c55383fa5689357bcdd2c8036725a55ed632bc.

A possible unauthorized memory access flaw was found in the Linux
kernel's cpu_entry_area mapping of X86 CPU data to memory, where a
user may guess the location of exception stacks or other important
data. Based on the previous CVE-2023-0597, the 'Randomize per-cpu
entry area' feature was implemented in /arch/x86/mm/cpu_entry_area.c,
which works through the init_cea_offsets() function when KASLR is
enabled. However, despite this feature, there is still a risk of per-
cpu entry area leaks. This issue could allow a local user to gain
access to some important data with memory in an expected location and
potentially escalate their privileges on the system.

authentik is an open-source Identity Provider. Prior to versions
2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5, authentik does not verify the source of the
X-Forwarded-For and X-Real-IP headers, both in the Python code and the
go code. Only authentik setups that are directly accessible by users
without a reverse proxy are susceptible to this. Possible spoofing of
IP addresses in logs, downstream applications proxied by (built in)
outpost, IP bypassing in custom flows if used. This poses a possible
security risk when someone has flows or policies that check the user's
IP address, e.g. when they want to ignore the user's 2 factor
authentication when the user is connected to the company network. A
second security risk is that the IP addresses in the logfiles and user
sessions are not reliable anymore. Anybody can spoof this address and
one cannot verify that the user has logged in from the IP address that
is in their account's log. A third risk is that this header is passed
on to the proxied application behind an outpost. The application may
do any kind of verification, logging, blocking or rate limiting based
on the IP address, and this IP address can be overridden by anybody
that want to. Versions 2023.4.3 and 2023.5.5 contain a patch for this
issue.

Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on
ActivityPub. Starting in version 1.3 and prior to versions 3.5.9,
4.0.5, and 4.1.3, an attacker using carefully crafted oEmbed data can
bypass the HTML sanitization performed by Mastodon and include
arbitrary HTML in oEmbed preview cards. This introduces a vector for
cross-site scripting (XSS) payloads that can be rendered in the user's
browser when a preview card for a malicious link is clicked through.
Versions 3.5.9, 4.0.5, and 4.1.3 contain a patch for this issue.

timeout on individual read operations. Prior to versions 3.5.9, 4.0.5,
and 4.1.3, a malicious server can indefinitely extend the duration of
the response through slowloris-type attacks. This vulnerability can be
used to keep all Mastodon workers busy for an extended duration of
time, leading to the server becoming unresponsive. Versions 3.5.9,
4.0.5, and 4.1.3 contain a patch for this issue.

Mastodon is a free, open-source social network server based on
ActivityPub. Starting in version 2.6.0 and prior to versions 3.5.9,
4.0.5, and 4.1.3, an attacker can craft a verified profile link using
specific formatting to conceal arbitrary parts of the link, enabling
it to appear to link to a different URL altogether. The link is
visually misleading, but clicking on it will reveal the actual link.
This can still be used for phishing, though, similar to IDN homograph
attacks. Versions 3.5.9, 4.0.5, and 4.1.3 contain a patch for this
issue.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. When an XWiki installation is
upgraded and that upgrade contains a fix for a bug in a document, just
a new version of that document is added. In some cases, it's still
possible to exploit the vulnerability that was fixed in the new
version. The severity of this depends on the fixed vulnerability, for
the purpose of this advisory take CVE-2022-36100/GHSA-2g5c-228j-p52x
as example - it is easily exploitable with just view rights and
critical. When XWiki is upgraded from a version before the fix for it
(e.g., 14.3) to a version including the fix (e.g., 14.4), the
vulnerability can still be reproduced by adding `rev=1.1` to the URL
used in the reproduction steps so remote code execution is possible
even after upgrading. Therefore, this affects the confidentiality,
integrity and availability of the whole XWiki installation. This
vulnerability also affects manually added script macros that contained
security vulnerabilities that were later fixed by changing the script
macro without deleting the versions with the security vulnerability
from the history. This vulnerability doesn't affect freshly installed
versions of XWiki. Further, this vulnerability doesn't affect content
that is only loaded from the current version of a document like the
code of wiki macros or UI extensions. This vulnerability has been
patched in XWiki 14.10.7 and 15.2RC1 by forcing old revisions to be
executed in a restricted mode that disables all script macros. As a
workaround, admins can manually delete old revisions of affected
documents. A script could be used to identify all installed documents
and delete the history for them. However, also manually added and
later corrected code may be affected by this vulnerability so it is
easy to miss documents.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services

user profile and notification settings can execute arbitrary script
macros including Groovy and Python macros that allow remote code
execution including unrestricted read and write access to all wiki

are advised to update. As a workaround the main security fix can be
manually applied by patching the affected document
`XWiki.Notifications.Code.NotificationRSSService`. This will break the
link to the differences, though as this requires additional changes to
Velocity templates as shown in the patch. While the default template
is available in the instance and can be easily patched, the template
for mentions is contained in a `.jar`-file and thus cannot be fixed
without replacing that jar.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. By either creating a new or
editing an existing document with an icon set, an attacker can inject
XWiki syntax and Velocity code that is executed with programming
rights and thus allows remote code execution. There are different
attack vectors, the simplest is the Velocity code in the icon set's
HTML or XWiki syntax definition. The [icon picker](https://extensions.
xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Icon%20Theme%20Application#HIconPic
ker) can be used to trigger the rendering of any icon set. The XWiki
syntax variant of the icon set is also used without any escaping in
some documents, allowing to inject XWiki syntax including script
macros into a document that might have programming right, for this the
currently used icon theme needs to be edited. Further, the HTML output
of the icon set is output as JSON in the icon picker and this JSON is
interpreted as XWiki syntax, allowing again the injection of script
macros into a document with programming right and thus allowing remote
code execution. This impacts the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of the whole XWiki instance. This issue has been patched
in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.1. Icon themes now require script right and
the code in the icon theme is executed within the context of the icon
theme, preventing any rights escalation. A macro for displaying icons
has been introduced to avoid injecting the raw wiki syntax of an icon
set into another document. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Xwiki commons is the common modules used by other XWiki top level
projects. The HTML sanitizer that is included in XWiki since version
14.6RC1 allowed form and input HTML tags. In the context of XWiki,
this allows an attacker without script right to either create forms
that can be used for phishing attacks or also in the context of a
sheet, the attacker could add an input like `{{html}}<input
type="hidden" name="content" value="{{groovy}}println(&quot;Hello from
Groovy!&quot;)" />{{/html}}` that would allow remote code execution
when it is submitted by an admin (the sheet is rendered as part of the
edit form). The attacker would need to ensure that the edit form looks
plausible, though, which can be non-trivial as without script right
the attacker cannot display the regular content of the document. This
has been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and 15.2RC1 by removing the central
form-related tags from the list of allowed tags. Users are advised to
upgrade. As a workaround an admin can manually disallow the tags by
adding `form, input, select, textarea, button` to the configuration
option `xml.htmlElementSanitizer.forbidTags` in the `xwiki.properties`
configuration file.

Interactsh is an open-source tool for detecting out-of-band
interactions. Domains configured with interactsh server prior to
version 1.0.0 were vulnerable to subdomain takeover for a specific
subdomain, i.e `app.` Interactsh server used to create cname entries
for `app` pointing to `projectdiscovery.github.io` as default, which
intended to used for hosting interactsh web client using GitHub pages.
This is a security issue with a self-hosted interactsh server in which
the user may not have configured a web client but still have a CNAME
entry pointing to GitHub pages, making them vulnerable to subdomain
takeover. This allows a threat actor to host / run arbitrary client
side code (cross-site scripting) in a user's browser when browsing the
vulnerable subdomain. Version 1.0.0 fixes this issue by making CNAME
optional, rather than default.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. Any user with edit rights can
edit all pages in the `CKEditor' space. This makes it possible to
perform a variety of harmful actions, such as removing technical
documents, leading to loss of service and editing the javascript
configuration of CKEditor, leading to persistent XSS. This issue has
been patched in XWiki 14.10.6 and XWiki 15.1. This issue has been
patched on the CKEditor Integration extension 1.64.9 for XWiki version
older than 14.6RC1. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to
upgrade may manually address the issue by restricting the `edit` and
`delete` rights to a trusted user or group (e.g. the
`XWiki.XWikiAdminGroup` group), implicitly disabling those rights for
all other users. See commit `9d9d86179` for details.

Eclipse Jetty provides a web server and servlet container. In versions
11.0.0 through 11.0.15, 10.0.0 through 10.0.15, and 9.0.0 through
9.4.52, an integer overflow in `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize` allows for
HTTP/2 HPACK header values to exceed their size limit.
`MetaDataBuilder.java` determines if a header name or value exceeds
the size limit, and throws an exception if the limit is exceeded.
However, when length is very large and huffman is true, the
multiplication by 4 in line 295 will overflow, and length will become
negative. `(_size+length)` will now be negative, and the check on line
296 will not be triggered. Furthermore, `MetaDataBuilder.checkSize`
allows for user-entered HPACK header value sizes to be negative,
potentially leading to a very large buffer allocation later on when
the user-entered size is multiplied by 2. This means that if a user
provides a negative length value (or, more precisely, a length value
which, when multiplied by the 4/3 fudge factor, is negative), and this
length value is a very large positive number when multiplied by 2,
then the user can cause a very large buffer to be allocated on the
server. Users of HTTP/2 can be impacted by a remote denial of service
attack. The issue has been fixed in versions 11.0.16, 10.0.16, and
9.4.53. There are no known workarounds.

Eclipse Jetty Canonical Repository is the canonical repository for the
Jetty project. Users of the CgiServlet with a very specific command
structure may have the wrong command executed. If a user sends a
request to a org.eclipse.jetty.servlets.CGI Servlet for a binary with
a space in its name, the servlet will escape the command by wrapping
it in quotation marks. This wrapped command, plus an optional command
prefix, will then be executed through a call to Runtime.exec. If the
original binary name provided by the user contains a quotation mark
followed by a space, the resulting command line will contain multiple
tokens instead of one. This issue was patched in version 9.4.52,
10.0.16, 11.0.16 and 12.0.0-beta2.

Reference: URL:https://support.aerospike.com/s/article/CVE-2023-36480-Aerospike-Java-Client-vulnerable-to-unsafe-deserialization-of-server-responses

The Aerospike Java client is a Java application that implements a
network protocol to communicate with an Aerospike server. Prior to
versions 7.0.0, 6.2.0, 5.2.0, and 4.5.0 some of the messages received
from the server contain Java objects that the client deserializes when
it encounters them without further validation. Attackers that manage
to trick clients into communicating with a malicious server can
include especially crafted objects in its responses that, once
deserialized by the client, force it to execute arbitrary code. This
can be abused to take control of the machine the client is running on.
Versions 7.0.0, 6.2.0, 5.2.0, and 4.5.0 contain a patch for this
issue.

"protobuf.js (aka protobufjs) 6.10.0 through 7.x before 7.2.5 allows
Prototype Pollution, a different vulnerability than CVE-2022-25878. A
user-controlled protobuf message can be used by an attacker to pollute
the prototype of Object.prototype by adding and overwriting its data
and functions. Exploitation can involve: (1) using the function parse
to parse protobuf messages on the fly, (2) loading .proto files by
using load/loadSync functions, or (3) providing untrusted input to the
functions ReflectionObject.setParsedOption and util.setProperty.

An issue was discovered in the Clario VPN client through 5.9.1.1662
for macOS. The VPN client insecurely configures the operating system
such that all IP traffic to the VPN server's IP address is sent in
plaintext outside the VPN tunnel even if this traffic is not generated
by the VPN client. This allows an adversary to trick the victim into
sending plaintext traffic to the VPN server's IP address and thereby
deanonymize the victim. NOTE: the tunnelcrack.mathyvanhoef.com website
uses this CVE ID to refer more generally to "ServerIP attack for only
traffic to the real IP address of the VPN server" rather than to only

The VPN client insecurely configures the operating system such that
all IP traffic to the VPN server's IP address is sent in plaintext

The WooCommerce PDF Invoice Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
to SQL Injection via the pageId parameter in versions up to, and
including, 1.2.89 due to insufficient escaping on the user supplied
parameter and lack of sufficient preparation on the existing SQL
query. This makes it possible for subscribers or higher to append
additional SQL queries into already existing queries that can be used
to extract sensitive information from the database.

Contao is an open source content management system. Starting in
version 4.0.0 and prior to versions 4.9.42, 4.13.28, and 5.1.10, it is
possible for untrusted backend users to inject malicious code into
headline fields in the back end, which will be executed both in the
element preview (back end) and on the website (front end).
Installations are only affected if there are untrusted back end users
who have the rights to modify headline fields, or other fields using
the input unit widget. Contao 4.9.42, 4.13.28, and 5.1.10 have a patch
for this issue. As a workaround, disable the login for all untrusted
back end users.

pypdf is a pure-python PDF library capable of splitting, merging,
cropping, and transforming the pages of PDF files. In version 2.10.5
an attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to
an infinite loop. This infinite loop blocks the current process and
can utilize a single core of the CPU by 100%. It does not affect
memory usage. That is, for example, the case if the user extracted
metadata from such a malformed PDF. Versions prior to 2.10.5 throw an
error, but do not hang forever. This issue was fixed with
https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/1331 which has been included in
release 2.10.6. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
should modify `PyPDF2/generic/_data_structures.py::read_object` to an
an error throwing case. See GHSA-hm9v-vj3r-r55m for details.

Kiwi TCMS, an open source test management system allows users to
upload attachments to test plans, test cases, etc. Versions of Kiwi
TCMS prior to 12.5 had introduced changes which were meant to serve
all uploaded files as plain text in order to prevent browsers from
executing potentially dangerous files when such files are accessed
directly. The previous Nginx configuration was incorrect allowing
certain browsers like Firefox to ignore the `Content-Type: text/plain`
header on some occasions thus allowing potentially dangerous scripts
to be executed. Additionally, file upload validators and parts of the
HTML rendering code had been found to require additional sanitation
and improvements. Version 12.5 fixes this vulnerability with updated
Nginx content type configuration, improved file upload validation code
to prevent more potentially dangerous uploads, and Sanitization of
test plan names used in the `tree_view_html()` function.

borgbackup is an opensource, deduplicating archiver with compression
and authenticated encryption. A flaw in the cryptographic
authentication scheme in borgbackup allowed an attacker to fake
archives and potentially indirectly cause backup data loss in the
repository. The attack requires an attacker to be able to: 1. insert
files (with no additional headers) into backups and 2. gain write
access to the repository. This vulnerability does not disclose
plaintext to the attacker, nor does it affect the authenticity of
existing archives. Creating plausible fake archives may be feasible
for empty or small archives, but is unlikely for large archives. The
issue has been fixed in borgbackup 1.2.5. Users are advised to
upgrade. Additionally to installing the fixed code, users must follow
the upgrade procedure as documented in the change log. Data loss after
being attacked can be avoided by reviewing the archives (timestamp and
contents valid and as expected) after any "borg check --repair" and
before "borg prune". There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

`tktchurch/website` contains the codebase for The King's Temple Church
website. In version 0.1.0, a Stripe API key was found in the public
code repository of the church's project. This sensitive information
was unintentionally committed and subsequently exposed in the

could potentially carry out transactions on behalf of the
organization, leading to financial losses. Additionally, they could
access sensitive customer information, leading to privacy violations
and potential legal implications. The affected component is the
codebase of our project, specifically the file(s) where the Stripe API
key is embedded. The key should have been stored securely, and not
committed to the codebase. The maintainers plan to revoke the leaked
Stripe API key immediately, generate a new one, and not commit the key

Uptime Kuma, a self-hosted monitoring tool, allows an authenticated
attacker to install a maliciously crafted plugin in versions prior to
1.22.1, which may lead to remote code execution. Uptime Kuma allows
authenticated users to install plugins from an official list of
plugins. This feature is currently disabled in the web interface, but
the corresponding API endpoints are still available after login. After
downloading a plugin, it's installed by calling `npm install` in the
installation directory of the plugin. Because the plugin is not
validated against the official list of plugins or installed with `npm
install --ignore-scripts`, a maliciously crafted plugin taking
advantage of npm scripts can gain remote code execution. Version
1.22.1 contains a patch for this issue.

Uptime Kuma, a self-hosted monitoring tool, has a path traversal
vulnerability in versions prior to 1.22.1. Uptime Kuma allows
authenticated users to install plugins from an official list of
plugins. This feature is currently disabled in the web interface, but
the corresponding API endpoints are still available after login.
Before a plugin is downloaded, the plugin installation directory is
checked for existence. If it exists, it's removed before the plugin
installation. Because the plugin is not validated against the official
list of plugins or sanitized, the check for existence and the removal
of the plugin installation directory are prone to path traversal. This
vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to delete files from
the server Uptime Kuma is running on. Depending on which files are
deleted, Uptime Kuma or the whole system may become unavailable due to
data loss.

Sanitize is an allowlist-based HTML and CSS sanitizer. Using carefully
crafted input, an attacker may be able to sneak arbitrary HTML and CSS
through Sanitize starting with version 3.0.0 and prior to version
6.0.2 when Sanitize is configured to use the built-in "relaxed" config
or when using a custom config that allows `style` elements and one or
more CSS at-rules. This could result in cross-site scripting or other
undesired behavior when the malicious HTML and CSS are rendered in a
browser. Sanitize 6.0.2 performs additional escaping of CSS in `style`
element content, which fixes this issue. Users who are unable to
upgrade can prevent this issue by using a Sanitize config that doesn't
allow `style` elements, using a Sanitize config that doesn't allow CSS
at-rules, or by manually escaping the character sequence `</` as `<\/`
in `style` element content.

Fides is an open-source privacy engineering platform for managing the
fulfillment of data privacy requests in a runtime environment, and the
enforcement of privacy regulations in code. A path traversal
(directory traversal) vulnerability affects fides versions lower than
version `2.15.1`, allowing remote attackers to access arbitrary files
on the fides webserver container's filesystem. The vulnerability is
patched in fides `2.15.1`. If the Fides webserver API is not directly
accessible to attackers and is instead deployed behind a reverse proxy
as recommended in Ethyca's security best practice documentation, and
the reverse proxy is an AWS application load balancer, the
vulnerability can't be exploited by these attackers. An AWS
application load balancer will reject this attack with a 400 error.
Additionally, any secrets supplied to the container using environment
variables rather than a `fides.toml` configuration file are not
affected by this vulnerability.

Sentry is an error tracking and performance monitoring platform.
Starting in version 23.6.0 and prior to version 23.6.2, the Sentry API
incorrectly returns the `access-control-allow-credentials: true` HTTP
header if the `Origin` request header ends with the `system.base-
hostname` option of Sentry installation. This only affects
installations that have `system.base-hostname` option explicitly set,
as it is empty by default. Impact is limited since recent versions of
major browsers have cross-site cookie blocking enabled by default.
However, this flaw could allow other multi-step attacks. The patch has
been released in Sentry 23.6.2.

SQLFluff is a SQL linter. Prior to version 2.1.2, in environments
where untrusted users have access to the config files, there is a
potential security vulnerability where those users could use the
`library_path` config value to allow arbitrary python code to be
executed via macros. For many users who use SQLFluff in the context of
an environment where all users already have fairly escalated
privileges, this may not be an issue - however in larger user bases,
or where SQLFluff is bundled into another tool where developers still
wish to give users access to supply their on rule configuration, this
may be an issue. The 2.1.2 release offers the ability for the
`library_path` argument to be overwritten on the command line by using
the `--library-path` option. This overrides any values provided in the
config files and effectively prevents this route of attack for users
which have access to the config file, but not to the scripts which
call the SQLFluff CLI directly. A similar option is provided for the
Python API, where users also have a greater ability to further
customise or override configuration as necessary. Unless
`library_path` is explicitly required, SQLFluff maintainers recommend
using the option `--library-path none` when invoking SQLFluff which
will disable the `library-path` option entirely regardless of the
options set in the configuration file or via inline config directives.
As a workaround, limiting access to - or otherwise validating
configuration files before they are ingested by SQLFluff will provides
a similar effect and does not require upgrade.

An Incomplete Internal State Distinction vulnerability in the packet
forwarding engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX 4600 and
SRX 5000 Series allows an adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of
Service (DoS). If an SRX is configured in L2 transparent mode the
receipt of a specific genuine packet can cause a single Packet
Processing Engines (PPE) component of the PFE to run into a loop,
which in turn will render the PPE unavailable. Each packet will cause
one PPE to get into a loop, leading to a gradual performance
degradation until all PPEs are unavailable and all traffic processing
stops. To recover the affected FPC need to be restarted. This issue

A Missing Authentication for Critical Function vulnerability in
Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series allows an unauthenticated,
network-based attacker to cause limited impact to the file system
integrity. With a specific request to user.php that doesn't require
authentication an attacker is able to upload arbitrary files via
J-Web, leading to a loss of integrity for a certain part of the file
system, which may allow chaining to other vulnerabilities. This issue
affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series: * All versions prior
to 20.4R3-S8; * 21.1 versions 21.1R1 and later; * 21.2 versions prior
to 21.2R3-S6; * 21.3 versions prior to 21.3R3-S5; * 21.4 versions

An Improper Handling of Undefined Values vulnerability in the periodic
packet management daemon (PPMD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX
Series(except MPC10, MPC11 and LC9600) allows an unauthenticated
adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When a malformed
CFM packet is received, it leads to an FPC crash. Continued receipt of
these packets causes a sustained denial of service. This vulnerability
occurs only when CFM has been configured on the interface. This issue
affects Juniper Networks Junos OS: versions prior to 19.1R3-S10 on MX
Series; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S7 on MX Series; 19.3 versions
prior to 19.3R3-S8 on MX Series; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S12 on

An Improper Check or Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability
in the Layer-2 control protocols daemon (l2cpd) of Juniper Networks
Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows an unauthenticated adjacent
attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When a malformed LLDP
packet is received, l2cpd will crash and restart. The impact of the
l2cpd crash is reinitialization of STP protocols (RSTP, MSTP or VSTP),
and MVRP and ERP. Also, if any services depend on LLDP state (like PoE
or VoIP device recognition), then these will also be affected.
Continued receipt of such packets will lead to a sustained Denial of
Service. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS 21.4 versions
prior to 21.4R3-S3; 22.1 versions prior to 22.1R3-S3; 22.2 versions

The Royal Elementor Addons plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
unauthenticated API key disclosure in versions up to, and including,
1.3.70 due to the plugin adding the API key to the source code of any
page running the MailChimp block. This makes it possible for
unauthenticated attackers to obtain a site's MailChimp API key. We
recommend resetting any MailChimp API keys if running a vulnerable
version of this plugin with the MailChimp block enabled as the API key
may have been compromised.
