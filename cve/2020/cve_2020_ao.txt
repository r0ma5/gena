Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/03/05/1

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.3, as used
with Xen PV. A certain part of the netback driver lacks necessary
treatment of errors such as failed memory allocations (as a result of
changes to the handling of grant mapping errors). A host OS denial of
service may occur during misbehavior of a networking frontend driver.
NOTE: this issue exists because of an incomplete fix for
CVE-2021-26931.

In Netflix OSS Hollow, since the Files.exists(parent) is run before
creating the directories, an attacker can pre-create these directories
with wide permissions. Additionally, since an insecure source of
randomness is used, the file names to be created can be
deterministically calculated.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20210722 CVE-2021-28131: Apache Impala: Impala logs contain secrets
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/07/22/3

Impala sessions use a 16 byte secret to verify that the session is not
being hijacked by another user. However, these secrets appear in the
Impala logs, therefore Impala users with access to the logs can use
another authenticated user's sessions with specially constructed
requests. This means the attacker is able to execute statements for
which they don't have the necessary privileges otherwise. Impala
deployments with Apache Sentry or Apache Ranger authorization enabled
may be vulnerable to privilege escalation if an authenticated attacker
is able to hijack a session or query from another authenticated user
with privileges not assigned to the attacker. Impala deployments with
audit logging enabled may be vulnerable to incorrect audit logging as
a user could undertake actions that were logged under the name of a
different authenticated user. Constructing an attack requires a high
degree of technical sophistication and access to the Impala system as
an authenticated user. Mitigation: If an Impala deployment uses Apache
Sentry, Apache Ranger or audit logging, then users should upgrade to a
version of Impala with the fix for IMPALA-10600. The Impala 4.0
release includes this fix. This hides session secrets from the logs to
eliminate the risk of any attack using this mechanism. In lieu of an
upgrade, restricting access to logs that expose secrets will reduce
the risk of an attack. Restricting access to the Impala deployment to
trusted users will also reduce the risk of an attack. Log redaction
techniques can be used to redact secrets from the logs.

Zoom through 5.5.4 sometimes allows attackers to read private
information on a participant's screen, even though the participant
never attempted to share the private part of their screen. When a user
shares a specific application window via the Share Screen
functionality, other meeting participants can briefly see contents of
other application windows that were explicitly not shared. The
contents of these other windows can (for instance) be seen for a short
period of time when they overlay the shared window and get into focus.
(An attacker can, of course, use a separate screen-recorder
application, unsupported by Zoom, to save all such contents for later
replays and analysis.) Depending on the unintentionally shared data,
this short exposure of screen contents may be a more or less severe
security issue.

An issue was discovered in GNOME GLib before 2.66.8. When
g_file_replace() is used with G_FILE_CREATE_REPLACE_DESTINATION to
replace a path that is a dangling symlink, it incorrectly also creates
the target of the symlink as an empty file, which could conceivably
have security relevance if the symlink is attacker-controlled. (If the
path is a symlink to a file that already exists, then the contents of
that file correctly remain unchanged.)

In Eclipse Jetty 9.4.37.v20210219 to 9.4.38.v20210224, the default
compliance mode allows requests with URIs that contain %2e or %2e%2e
segments to access protected resources within the WEB-INF directory.
For example a request to /context/%2e/WEB-INF/web.xml can retrieve the
web.xml file. This can reveal sensitive information regarding the
implementation of a web application.

Status: Candidate
Reference: CONFIRM:https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/12016
Reference: URL:https://github.com/eclipse/openj9/issues/12016

In Eclipse Openj9 to version 0.25.0, usage of the
jdk.internal.reflect.ConstantPool API causes the JVM in some cases to
pre-resolve certain constant pool entries. This allows a user to call
static methods or access static members without running the class
initialization method, and may allow a user to observe uninitialized
values.

Eclipse Jersey 2.28 to 2.33 and Eclipse Jersey 3.0.0 to 3.0.1 contains
a local information disclosure vulnerability. This is due to the use
of the File.createTempFile which creates a file inside of the system
temporary directory with the permissions: -rw-r--r--. Thus the
contents of this file are viewable by all other users locally on the
system. As such, if the contents written is security sensitive, it can
be disclosed to other local users.

versions <1.10.15 in 1.x series and affects 2.0.0 and 2.0.1 and 2.x
series. This is the same as CVE-2020-13944 & CVE-2020-17515 but the
implemented fix did not fix the issue completely. Update to Airflow
1.10.15 or 2.0.2. Please also update your Python version to the latest
available PATCH releases of the installed MINOR versions, example
update to Python 3.6.13 if you are on Python 3.6. (Those contain the
fix for CVE-2021-23336

An issue was discovered in Contiki through 3.0. When sending an ICMPv6
error message because of invalid extension header options in an
incoming IPv6 packet, there is an attempt to remove the RPL extension
headers. Because the packet length and the extension header length are
unchecked (with respect to the available data) at this stage, and
these variables are susceptible to integer underflow, it is possible
to construct an invalid extension header that will cause memory
corruption issues and lead to a Denial-of-Service condition. This is
related to rpl-ext-header.c.

The urllib3 library 1.26.x before 1.26.4 for Python omits SSL
certificate validation in some cases involving HTTPS to HTTPS proxies.
The initial connection to the HTTPS proxy (if an SSLContext isn't
given via proxy_config) doesn't verify the hostname of the
certificate. This means certificates for different servers that still
validate properly with the default urllib3 SSLContext will be silently
accepted.

An issue was discovered in the /api/connector endpoint handler in
Yubico yubihsm-connector before 3.0.1 (in YubiHSM SDK before 2021.04).
The handler did not validate the length of the request, which can lead
to a state where yubihsm-connector becomes stuck in a loop waiting for
the YubiHSM to send it data, preventing any further operations until
the yubihsm-connector is restarted. An attacker can send 0, 1, or 2
bytes to trigger this.

that matches the range allowed by a NAT ACL and a range denied by a
Security ACL to be forwarded incorrectly as it should have been denied
by the Security ACL. This can enable an ACL bypass.

Reference: MISC:https://varnish-cache.org/security/VSV00006.html

Varnish varnish-modules before 0.17.1 allows remote attackers to cause
a denial of service (daemon restart) in some configurations. This does
not affect organizations that only install the Varnish Cache product;
however, it is common to install both Varnish Cache and varnish-
modules. Specifically, an assertion failure or NULL pointer
dereference can be triggered in Varnish Cache through the varnish-
modules header.append() and header.copy() functions. For some Varnish
Configuration Language (VCL) files, this gives remote clients an
opportunity to cause a Varnish Cache restart. A restart reduces
overall availability and performance due to an increased number of
cache misses, and may cause higher load on backend servers.

Apache Subversion SVN authz protected copyfrom paths regression
Subversion servers reveal 'copyfrom' paths that should be hidden
according to configured path-based authorization (authz) rules. When a
node has been copied from a protected location, users with access to
the copy can see the 'copyfrom' path of the original. This also
reveals the fact that the node was copied. Only the 'copyfrom' path is
revealed; not its contents. Both httpd and svnserve servers are
vulnerable.

The devise_masquerade gem before 1.3 allows certain attacks when a
password's salt is unknown. An application that uses this gem to let
administrators masquerade/impersonate users loses one layer of
security protection compared to a situation where Devise (without this
extension) is used. If the server-side secret_key_base value became
publicly known (for instance if it is committed to a public repository
by mistake), there are still other protections in place that prevent
an attacker from impersonating any user on the site. When masquerading
is not used in a plain Devise application, one must know the password
salt of the target user if one wants to encrypt and sign a valid
session cookie. When devise_masquerade is used, however, an attacker
can decide which user the "back" action will go back to without
knowing that user's password salt and simply knowing the user ID, by
manipulating the session cookie and pretending that a user is already
masqueraded by an administrator.

HVM soft-reset crashes toolstack libxl requires all data structures
passed across its public interface to be initialized before use and
disposed of afterwards by calling a specific set of functions. Many
internal data structures also require this initialize / dispose
discipline, but not all of them. When the "soft reset" feature was
implemented, the libxl__domain_suspend_state structure didn't require
any initialization or disposal. At some point later, an initialization
function was introduced for the structure; but the "soft reset" path
wasn't refactored to call the initialization function. When a guest
nwo initiates a "soft reboot", uninitialized data structure leads to
an assert() when later code finds the structure in an unexpected
state. The effect of this is to crash the process monitoring the
guest. How this affects the system depends on the structure of the
toolstack. For xl, this will have no security-relevant effect: every
VM has its own independent monitoring process, which contains no
state. The domain in question will hang in a crashed state, but can be
destroyed by `xl destroy` just like any other non-cooperating domain.
For daemon-based toolstacks linked against libxl, such as libvirt,
this will crash the toolstack, losing the state of any in-progress
operations (localized DoS), and preventing further administrator
operations unless the daemon is configured to restart automatically
(system-wide DoS). If crashes "leak" resources, then repeated crashes
could use up resources, also causing a system-wide DoS.

The fix for XSA-365 includes initialization of pointers such that
subsequent cleanup code wouldn't use uninitialized or stale values.
This initialization went too far and may under certain conditions also
overwrite pointers which are in need of cleaning up. The lack of
cleanup would result in leaking persistent grants. The leak in turn
would prevent fully cleaning up after a respective guest has died,
leaving around zombie domains. All Linux versions having the fix for
XSA-365 applied are vulnerable. XSA-365 was classified to affect
versions back to at least 3.11.

x86: Speculative vulnerabilities with bare (non-shim) 32-bit PV guests
32-bit x86 PV guest kernels run in ring 1. At the time when Xen was
developed, this area of the i386 architecture was rarely used, which
is why Xen was able to use it to implement paravirtualisation, Xen's
novel approach to virtualization. In AMD64, Xen had to use a different
implementation approach, so Xen does not use ring 1 to support 64-bit
guests. With the focus now being on 64-bit systems, and the
availability of explicit hardware support for virtualization, fixing
speculation issues in ring 1 is not a priority for processor
companies. Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is an
architectural x86 extension put together to combat speculative
execution sidechannel attacks, including Spectre v2. It was
retrofitted in microcode to existing CPUs. For more details on Spectre
v2, see: http://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-254.html However, IBRS
does not architecturally protect ring 0 from predictions learnt in
ring 1. For more details, see: https://software.intel.com/security-
software-guidance/deep-dives/deep-dive-indirect-branch-restricted-
speculation Similar situations may exist with other mitigations for
other kinds of speculative execution attacks. The situation is quite
likely to be similar for speculative execution attacks which have yet
to be discovered, disclosed, or mitigated.

relates to the TSX Async Abort speculative security vulnerability.
Please see https://xenbits.xen.org/xsa/advisory-305.html for details.
Mitigating TAA by disabling TSX (the default and preferred option)
requires selecting a non-default setting in MSR_TSX_CTRL. This setting
isn't restored after S3 suspend.

Guest triggered use-after-free in Linux xen-netback A malicious or
buggy network PV frontend can force Linux netback to disable the
interface and terminate the receive kernel thread associated with
queue 0 in response to the frontend sending a malformed packet. Such
kernel thread termination will lead to a use-after-free in Linux
netback when the backend is destroyed, as the kernel thread associated
with queue 0 will have already exited and thus the call to
kthread_stop will be performed against a stale pointer.

inappropriate x86 IOMMU timeout detection / handling IOMMUs process
commands issued to them in parallel with the operation of the CPU(s)
issuing such commands. In the current implementation in Xen,
asynchronous notification of the completion of such commands is not
used. Instead, the issuing CPU spin-waits for the completion of the
most recently issued command(s). Some of these waiting loops try to
apply a timeout to fail overly-slow commands. The course of action
upon a perceived timeout actually being detected is inappropriate: -
on Intel hardware guests which did not originally cause the timeout
may be marked as crashed, - on AMD hardware higher layer callers would
not be notified of the issue, making them continue as if the IOMMU
operation succeeded.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/09/01/2

long running loops in grant table handling In order to properly
monitor resource use, Xen maintains information on the grant mappings
a domain may create to map grants offered by other domains. In the
process of carrying out certain actions, Xen would iterate over all
such entries, including ones which aren't in use anymore and some
which may have been created but never used. If the number of entries
for a given domain is large enough, this iterating of the entire table
may tie up a CPU for too long, starving other domains or causing
issues in the hypervisor itself. Note that a domain may map its own
grants, i.e. there is no need for multiple domains to be involved
here. A pair of "cooperating" guests may, however, cause the effects
to be more severe.

inadequate grant-v2 status frames array bounds check The v2 grant
table interface separates grant attributes from grant status. That is,
when operating in this mode, a guest has two tables. As a result,
guests also need to be able to retrieve the addresses that the new
status tracking table can be accessed through. For 32-bit guests on
x86, translation of requests has to occur because the interface
structure layouts commonly differ between 32- and 64-bit. The
translation of the request to obtain the frame numbers of the grant
status table involves translating the resulting array of frame
numbers. Since the space used to carry out the translation is limited,
the translation layer tells the core function the capacity of the
array within translation space. Unfortunately the core function then
only enforces array bounds to be below 8 times the specified value,
and would write past the available space if enough frame numbers
needed storing.

PCI devices with RMRRs not deassigned correctly Certain PCI devices in
a system might be assigned Reserved Memory Regions (specified via
Reserved Memory Region Reporting, "RMRR"). These are typically used
for platform tasks such as legacy USB emulation. If such a device is
passed through to a guest, then on guest shutdown the device is not
properly deassigned. The IOMMU configuration for these devices which
are not properly deassigned ends up pointing to a freed data

PoD operations on misaligned GFNs T[his CNA information record relates
to multiple CVEs; the text explains which aspects/vulnerabilities
correspond to which CVE.] x86 HVM and PVH guests may be started in
populate-on-demand (PoD) mode, to provide a way for them to later
easily have more memory assigned. Guests are permitted to control
certain P2M aspects of individual pages via hypercalls. These
hypercalls may act on ranges of pages specified via page orders
(resulting in a power-of-2 number of pages). The implementation of
some of these hypercalls for PoD does not enforce the base page frame
number to be suitably aligned for the specified order, yet some code
involved in PoD handling actually makes such an assumption. These
operations are XENMEM_decrease_reservation (CVE-2021-28704) and
XENMEM_populate_physmap (CVE-2021-28707), the latter usable only by
domains controlling the guest, i.e. a de-privileged qemu or a stub
domain. (Patch 1, combining the fix to both these two issues.) In
addition handling of XENMEM_decrease_reservation can also trigger a
host crash when the specified page order is neither 4k nor 2M nor 1G
(CVE-2021-28708, patch 2).

guests may exceed their designated memory limit When a guest is
permitted to have close to 16TiB of memory, it may be able to issue
hypercalls to increase its memory allocation beyond the administrator
established limit. This is a result of a calculation done with 32-bit
precision, which may overflow. It would then only be the overflowed
(and hence small) number which gets compared against the established
upper bound.

certain VT-d IOMMUs may not work in shared page table mode For
efficiency reasons, address translation control structures (page
tables) may (and, on suitable hardware, by default will) be shared
between CPUs, for second-level translation (EPT), and IOMMUs. These
page tables are presently set up to always be 4 levels deep. However,
an IOMMU may require the use of just 3 page table levels. In such a
configuration the lop level table needs to be stripped before
inserting the root table's address into the hardware pagetable base
register. When sharing page tables, Xen erroneously skipped this
stripping. Consequently, the guest is able to write to leaf page table
entries.

Guest can force Linux netback driver to hog large amounts of kernel
memory T[his CNA information record relates to multiple CVEs; the text
explains which aspects/vulnerabilities correspond to which CVE.]
Incoming data packets for a guest in the Linux kernel's netback driver
are buffered until the guest is ready to process them. There are some
measures taken for avoiding to pile up too much data, but those can be
bypassed by the guest: There is a timeout how long the client side of
an interface can stop consuming new packets before it is assumed to
have stalled, but this timeout is rather long (60 seconds by default).
Using a UDP connection on a fast interface can easily accumulate
gigabytes of data in that time. (CVE-2021-28715) The timeout could
even never trigger if the guest manages to have only one free slot in
its RX queue ring page and the next package would require more than
one free slot, which may be the case when using GSO, XDP, or software
hashing. (CVE-2021-28714)

An issue was discovered in the Linux kernel through 5.11.x.
kernel/bpf/verifier.c performs undesirable out-of-bounds speculation
on pointer arithmetic, leading to side-channel attacks that defeat
Spectre mitigations and obtain sensitive information from kernel
memory. Specifically, for sequences of pointer arithmetic operations,
the pointer modification performed by the first operation is not
correctly accounted for when restricting subsequent operations.

In Apache Commons IO before 2.7, When invoking the method
FileNameUtils.normalize with an improper input string, like
"//../foo", or "\\..\foo", the result would be the same value, thus
possibly providing access to files in the parent directory, but not
further above (thus "limited" path traversal), if the calling code
would use the result to construct a path value.

In Gradle from version 5.1 and before version 7.0 there is a
vulnerability which can lead to information disclosure and/or
dependency poisoning. Repository content filtering is a security
control Gradle introduced to help users specify what repositories are
used to resolve specific dependencies. This feature was introduced in
the wake of the "A Confusing Dependency" blog post. In some cases,
Gradle may ignore content filters and search all repositories for
dependencies. This only occurs when repository content filtering is
used from within a `pluginManagement` block in a settings file. This
may change how dependencies are resolved for Gradle plugins and build
scripts. For builds that are vulnerable, there are two risks: 1)
Information disclosure: Gradle could make dependency requests to
repositories outside your organization and leak internal package
identifiers. 2) Dependency poisoning/Dependency confusion: Gradle
could download a malicious binary from a repository outside your
organization due to name squatting. For a full example and more
details refer to the referenced GitHub Security Advisory. The problem
has been patched and released with Gradle 7.0. Users relying on this
feature should upgrade their build as soon as possible. As a
workaround, users may use a company repository which has the right
rules for fetching packages from public repositories, or use project
level repository content filtering, inside `buildscript.repositories`.
This option is available since Gradle 5.1 when the feature was
introduced.

In Gradle before version 7.0, on Unix-like systems, the system
temporary directory can be created with open permissions that allow
multiple users to create and delete files within it. Gradle builds
could be vulnerable to a local privilege escalation from an attacker
quickly deleting and recreating files in the system temporary
directory. This vulnerability impacted builds using precompiled script
plugins written in Kotlin DSL and tests for Gradle plugins written
using ProjectBuilder or TestKit. If you are on Windows or modern
versions of macOS, you are not vulnerable. If you are on a Unix-like
operating system with the "sticky" bit set on your system temporary
directory, you are not vulnerable. The problem has been patched and
released with Gradle 7.0. As a workaround, on Unix-like operating
systems, ensure that the "sticky" bit is set. This only allows the
original user (or root) to delete a file. If you are unable to change
the permissions of the system temporary directory, you can move the
Java temporary directory by setting the System Property
`java.io.tmpdir`. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build
user only. For additional details refer to the referenced GitHub
Security Advisory.

In Gradle before version 7.0, files created with open permissions in
the system temporary directory can allow an attacker to access
information downloaded by Gradle. Some builds could be vulnerable to a
local information disclosure. Remote files accessed through
TextResourceFactory are downloaded into the system temporary directory
first. Sensitive information contained in these files can be exposed
to other local users on the same system. If you do not use the
`TextResourceFactory` API, you are not vulnerable. As of Gradle 7.0,
uses of the system temporary directory have been moved to the Gradle
User Home directory. By default, this directory is restricted to the
user running the build. As a workaround, set a more restrictive umask
that removes read access to other users. When files are created in the
system temporary directory, they will not be accessible to other
users. If you are unable to change your system's umask, you can move
the Java temporary directory by setting the System Property
`java.io.tmpdir`. The new path needs to limit permissions to the build
user only.

Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent does not limit
the size of requests it receives from HTTP clients. A malicious user
could send an HTTP request with a very large body, leading to memory
exhaustion and denial of service. Sydent also does not limit response
size for requests it makes to remote Matrix homeservers. A malicious
homeserver could return a very large response, again leading to memory
exhaustion and denial of service. This affects any server which
accepts registration requests from untrusted clients. This issue has
been patched by releases 89071a1, 0523511, f56eee3. As a workaround
request sizes can be limited in an HTTP reverse-proxy. There are no
known workarounds for the problem with overlarge responses.

Sydent is a reference Matrix identity server. Sydent can be induced to
send HTTP GET requests to internal systems, due to lack of parameter
validation or IP address blacklisting. It is not possible to
exfiltrate data or control request headers, but it might be possible
to use the attack to perform an internal port enumeration. This issue
has been addressed in in 9e57334, 8936925, 3d531ed, 0f00412. A
potential workaround would be to use a firewall to ensure that Sydent
cannot reach internal HTTP resources.

Wagtail is a Django content management system. In affected versions of
Wagtail, when saving the contents of a rich text field in the admin
interface, Wagtail does not apply server-side checks to ensure that
link URLs use a valid protocol. A malicious user with access to the
admin interface could thus craft a POST request to publish content
with `javascript:` URLs containing arbitrary code. The vulnerability
is not exploitable by an ordinary site visitor without access to the
Wagtail admin. See referenced GitHub advisory for additional details,
including a workaround. Patched versions have been released as Wagtail
2.11.7 (for the LTS 2.11 branch) and Wagtail 2.12.4 (for the current
2.12 branch).

allows an attacker to create a form that will bypass Rails' built-in
CSRF protection when submitted by a victim with a trestle-auth admin
session. This potentially allows an attacker to alter protected data,
including admin account credentials. The vulnerability has been fixed
in trestle-auth 0.4.2 released to RubyGems.

Anuko Time Tracker is an open source, web-based time tracking
application written in PHP. In Time Tracker before version
1.19.27.5431 a Cross site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability
existed. The nature of CSRF is that a logged on user may be tricked by
social engineering to click on an attacker-provided form that executes
an unintended action such as changing user password. The vulnerability
is fixed in Time Tracker version 1.19.27.5431. Upgrade is recommended.
If upgrade is not practical, introduce ttMitigateCSRF() function in
/WEB-INF/lib/common.php.lib using the latest available code and call
it from ttAccessAllowed().

The Grav admin plugin prior to version 1.10.11 does not correctly
verify caller's privileges. As a consequence, users with the
permission `admin.login` can install third-party plugins and their
dependencies. By installing the right plugin, an attacker can obtain
an arbitrary code execution primitive and elevate their privileges on
the instance. The vulnerability has been addressed in version 1.10.11.
As a mitigation blocking access to the `/admin` path from untrusted
sources will reduce the probability of exploitation.

Nacos is a platform designed for dynamic service discovery and

when configured to use authentication (-Dnacos.core.auth.enabled=true)
Nacos uses the AuthFilter servlet filter to enforce authentication.
This filter has a backdoor that enables Nacos servers to bypass this
filter and therefore skip authentication checks. This mechanism relies
on the user-agent HTTP header so it can be easily spoofed. This issue
may allow any user to carry out any administrative tasks on the Nacos

matrix-media-repo is an open-source multi-domain media repository for
Matrix. Versions 1.2.6 and earlier of matrix-media-repo do not
properly handle malicious images which are crafted to be small in file
size, but large in complexity. A malicious user could upload a
relatively small image in terms of file size, using particular image
formats, which expands to have extremely large dimensions during the
process of thumbnailing. The server can be exhausted of memory in the
process of trying to load the whole image into memory for
thumbnailing, leading to denial of service. Version 1.2.7 has a fix
for the vulnerability.

Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. A heap buffer
overflow was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The heap
overflow is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a
crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
vulnerability to gain code execution, if they can trick the victim
into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note that this bug is only
triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less frequently used
Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger
the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an
extra command-line argument such as `insert`. The bug is fixed in
version v0.27.4.

Kirby is an open source CMS. An editor with write access to the Kirby
Panel can upload an SVG file that contains harmful content like
`<script>` tags. The direct link to that file can be sent to other
users or visitors of the site. If the victim opens that link in a
browser where they are logged in to Kirby, the script will run and can
for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of
the victim. This vulnerability is critical if you might have potential
attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users, as they can
escalate their privileges if they get access to the Panel session of
an admin user. Depending on your site, other JavaScript-powered
attacks are possible. Visitors without Panel access can only use this
attack vector if your site allows SVG file uploads in frontend forms
and you don't already sanitize uploaded SVG files. The problem has
been patched in Kirby 3.5.4. Please update to this or a later version
to fix the vulnerability. Frontend upload forms need to be patched
separately depending on how they store the uploaded file(s). If you
use `File::create()`, you are protected by updating to 3.5.4+. As a
work around you can disable the upload of SVG files in your file
blueprints.

Cygwin Git is a patch set for the git command line tool for the cygwin
environment. A specially crafted repository that contains symbolic
links as well as files with backslash characters in the file name may
cause just-checked out code to be executed while checking out a
repository using Git on Cygwin. The problem will be patched in the
Cygwin Git v2.31.1-2 release. At time of writing, the vulnerability is
present in the upstream Git source code; any Cygwin user who compiles
Git for themselves from upstream sources should manually apply a patch
to mitigate the vulnerability. As mitigation users should not clone or
pull from repositories from untrusted sources. CVE-2019-1354 was an
equivalent vulnerability in Git for Visual Studio.

deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An out-of-bounds
read was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3 and earlier. The out-of-
bounds read is triggered when Exiv2 is used to write metadata into a
crafted image file. An attacker could potentially exploit the
vulnerability to cause a denial of service by crashing Exiv2, if they
can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. Note
that this bug is only triggered when writing the metadata, which is a
less frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For
example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you
need to add an extra command-line argument such as insert. The bug is
fixed in version v0.27.4.

Synapse is a Matrix reference homeserver written in python (pypi
package matrix-synapse). Matrix is an ecosystem for open federated
Instant Messaging and VoIP. In Synapse before version 1.33.2 "Push
rules" can specify conditions under which they will match, including
`event_match`, which matches event content against a pattern including
wildcards. Certain patterns can cause very poor performance in the
matching engine, leading to a denial-of-service when processing
moderate length events. The issue is patched in version 1.33.2. A
potential workaround might be to prevent users from making custom push
rules, by blocking such requests at a reverse-proxy.

Composer is a dependency manager for PHP. URLs for Mercurial
repositories in the root composer.json and package source download
URLs are not sanitized correctly. Specifically crafted URL values
allow code to be executed in the HgDriver if hg/Mercurial is installed
on the system. The impact to Composer users directly is limited as the
composer.json file is typically under their own control and source
download URLs can only be supplied by third party Composer
repositories they explicitly trust to download and execute source code
from, e.g. Composer plugins. The main impact is to services passing
user input to Composer, including Packagist.org and Private Packagist.
This allowed users to trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability
has been patched on Packagist.org and Private Packagist within 12h of
receiving the initial vulnerability report and based on a review of
logs, to the best of our knowledge, was not abused by anyone. Other
services/tools using VcsRepository/VcsDriver or derivatives may also
be vulnerable and should upgrade their composer/composer dependency
immediately. Versions 1.10.22 and 2.0.13 include patches for this
issue.

HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative
markdown editor. An attacker can read arbitrary `.md` files from the
server's filesystem due to an improper input validation, which results
in the ability to perform a relative path traversal. To verify if you
are affected, you can try to open the following URL:
`http://localhost:3000/..%2F..%2FREADME#` (replace
`http://localhost:3000` with your instance's base-URL e.g.
`https://demo.hedgedoc.org/..%2F..%2FREADME#`). If you see a README
page being rendered, you run an affected version. The attack works due
the fact that the internal router passes the url-encoded alias to the
`noteController.showNote`-function. This function passes the input
directly to findNote() utility function, that will pass it on the the
parseNoteId()-function, that tries to make sense out of the
noteId/alias and check if a note already exists and if so, if a
corresponding file on disk was updated. If no note exists the note
creation-function is called, which pass this unvalidated alias, with a
`.md` appended, into a path.join()-function which is read from the
filesystem in the follow up routine and provides the pre-filled
content of the new note. This allows an attacker to not only read
arbitrary `.md` files from the filesystem, but also observes changes
to them. The usefulness of this attack can be considered limited,
since mainly markdown files are use the file-ending `.md` and all
markdown files contained in the hedgedoc project, like the README, are
public anyway. If other protections such as a chroot or container or
proper file permissions are in place, this attack's usefulness is
rather limited. On a reverse-proxy level one can force a URL-decode,
which will prevent this attack because the router will not accept such
a path.

HedgeDoc (formerly known as CodiMD) is an open-source collaborative
markdown editor. An attacker is able to receive arbitrary files from
the file system when exporting a note to PDF. Since the code injection
has to take place as note content, there fore this exploit requires
the attackers ability to modify a note. This will affect all
instances, which have pdf export enabled. This issue has been fixed by
https://github.com/hedgedoc/hedgedoc/commit/c1789474020a6d668d616464cb
2da5e90e123f65 and is available in version 1.5.0. Starting the
CodiMD/HedgeDoc instance with `CMD_ALLOW_PDF_EXPORT=false` or set
`"allowPDFExport": false` in config.json can mitigate this issue for
those who cannot upgrade. This exploit works because while PhantomJS
doesn't actually render the `file:///` references to the PDF file
itself, it still uses them internally, and exfiltration is possible,
and easy through JavaScript rendering. The impact is pretty bad, as
the attacker is able to read the CodiMD/HedgeDoc `config.json` file as
well any other files on the filesystem. Even though the suggested
Docker deploy option doesn't have many interesting files itself, the
`config.json` still often contains sensitive information, database
credentials, and maybe OAuth secrets among other things.

Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior
to 1.9.0, the client side session module uses the application startup
time as the signing key by default. This means that if an attacker can
determine this time, and if encryption is not also used (which is
recommended, but is not on by default), the session data could be
tampered with by someone with the ability to write cookies. The
default configuration is unsuitable for production use as an
application restart renders all sessions invalid and is not multi-host
compatible, but its use is not actively prevented. As of Ratpack
1.9.0, the default value is a securely randomly generated value,
generated at application startup time. As a workaround, supply an
alternative signing key, as per the documentation's recommendation.

Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior

unencrypted, but signed, data being set as cookie values. This means
that if something sensitive goes into the session, it could be read by
something with access to the cookies. For this to be a vulnerability,
some kind of sensitive data would need to be stored in the session and
the session cookie would have to leak. For example, the cookies are
not configured with httpOnly and an adjacent XSS vulnerability within
the site allowed capture of the cookies. As of version 1.9.0, a
securely randomly generated signing key is used. As a workaround, one
may supply an encryption key, as per the documentation recommendation.

gaining access to Ghost Admin. Attackers can gain access by getting
logged in users to click a link containing malicious code. Users do
not need to enter credentials and may not know they've visited a
malicious site. Ghost(Pro) has already been patched. We can find no
evidence that the issue was exploited on Ghost(Pro) prior to the patch
being added. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version
between 4.0.0 and 4.3.2. Immediate action should be taken to secure
your site. The issue has been fixed in 4.3.3, all 4.x sites should
upgrade as soon as possible. As the endpoint is unused, the patch
simply removes it. As a workaround blocking access to /ghost/preview

Ratpack is a toolkit for creating web applications. In versions prior
to 1.9.0, a malicious attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)
via a maliciously crafted Java deserialization gadget chain leveraged
against the Ratpack session store. If one's application does not use
Ratpack's session mechanism, it is not vulnerable. Ratpack 1.9.0
introduces a strict allow-list mechanism that mitigates this
vulnerability when used. Two possible workarounds exist. The simplest
mitigation for users of earlier versions is to reduce the likelihood
of attackers being able to write to the session data store.
Alternatively or additionally, the allow-list mechanism could be
manually back ported by providing an alternative implementation of
`SessionSerializer` that uses an allow-list.

cumulative-distribution-function is an open source npm library used
which calculates statistical cumulative distribution function from
data array of x values. In versions prior to 2.0.0 apps using this
library on improper data may crash or go into an infinite-loop. In the
case of a nodejs server-app using this library to act on invalid non-
numeric data, the nodejs server may crash. This may affect other users
of this server and/or require the server to be rebooted for proper
operation. In the case of a browser app using this library to act on
invalid non-numeric data, that browser may crash or lock up. A flaw
enabling an infinite-loop was discovered in the code for evaluating
the cumulative-distribution-function of input data. Although the
documentation explains that numeric data is required, some users may
confuse an array of strings like ["1","2","3","4","5"] for numeric
data [1,2,3,4,5] when it is in fact string data. An infinite loop is
possible when the cumulative-distribution-function is evaluated for a
given point when the input data is string data rather than type
`number`. This vulnerability enables an infinite-cpu-loop denial-of-
service-attack on any app using npm:cumulative-distribution-function
v1.0.3 or earlier if the attacker can supply malformed data to the
library. The vulnerability could also manifest if a data source to be
analyzed changes data type from Arrays of number (proper) to Arrays of
string (invalid, but undetected by earlier version of the library).
Users should upgrade to at least v2.0.0, or the latest version. Tests
for several types of invalid data have been created, and version 2.0.0
has been tested to reject this invalid data by throwing a
`TypeError()` instead of processing it. Developers using this library
may wish to adjust their app's code slightly to better tolerate or
handle this TypeError. Apps performing proper numeric data validation
before sending data to this library should be mostly unaffected by
this patch. The vulnerability can be mitigated in older versions by
ensuring that only finite numeric data of type `Array[number]` or
`number` is passed to `cumulative-distribution-function` and its
`f(x)` function, respectively.

Envoy is a cloud-native edge/middle/service proxy. Envoy does not
decode escaped slash sequences `%2F` and `%5C` in HTTP URL paths in
versions 1.18.2 and before. A remote attacker may craft a path with
escaped slashes, e.g. `/something%2F..%2Fadmin`, to bypass access
control, e.g. a block on `/admin`. A backend server could then decode
slash sequences and normalize path and provide an attacker access
beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy. ### Impact
Escalation of Privileges when using RBAC or JWT filters with
enforcement based on URL path. Users with back end servers that
interpret `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably are
impacted. ### Attack Vector URL paths containing escaped slash
characters delivered by untrusted client. Patches in versions 1.18.3,
1.17.3, 1.16.4, 1.15.5 contain new path normalization option to decode
escaped slash characters. As a workaround, if back end servers treat
`%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably and a URL path based
access control is configured, one may reconfigure the back end server
to not treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably.

WP-CLI is the command-line interface for WordPress. An improper error
handling in HTTPS requests management in WP-CLI version 0.12.0 and
later allows remote attackers able to intercept the communication to
remotely disable the certificate verification on WP-CLI side, gaining
full control over the communication content, including the ability to
impersonate update servers and push malicious updates towards
WordPress instances controlled by the vulnerable WP-CLI agent, or push
malicious updates toward WP-CLI itself. The vulnerability stems from
the fact that the default behavior of `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()`
when encountering a TLS handshake error is to disable certificate
validation and retry the same request. The default behavior has been
changed with version 2.5.0 of WP-CLI and the `wp-cli/wp-cli` framework
(via https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523) so that the
`WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()` method accepts an `$insecure` option
that is `false` by default and consequently that a TLS handshake
failure is a hard error by default. This new default is a breaking
change and ripples through to all consumers of
`WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()`, including those in separate WP-CLI
bundled or third-party packages. https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-
cli/pull/5523 has also added an `--insecure` flag to the `cli update`
command to counter this breaking change. There is no direct workaround
for the default insecure behavior of `wp-cli/wp-cli` versions before
2.5.0. The workaround for dealing with the breaking change in the
commands directly affected by the new secure default behavior is to
add the `--insecure` flag to manually opt-in to the previous insecure
behavior.

Puma is a concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for Ruby/Rack applications. The
fix for CVE-2019-16770 was incomplete. The original fix only protected
existing connections that had already been accepted from having their
requests starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all
threads in the same process. However, new connections may still be
starved by greedy persistent-connections saturating all threads in all
processes in the cluster. A `puma` server which received more
concurrent `keep-alive` connections than the server had threads in its
threadpool would service only a subset of connections, denying service
to the unserved connections. This problem has been fixed in `puma`
4.3.8 and 5.3.1. Setting `queue_requests false` also fixes the issue.
This is not advised when using `puma` without a reverse proxy, such as
`nginx` or `apache`, because you will open yourself to slow client
attacks (e.g. slowloris). The fix is very small and a git patch is
available for those using unsupported versions of Puma.

Pydantic is a data validation and settings management using Python
type hinting. In affected versions passing either `'infinity'`,
`'inf'` or `float('inf')` (or their negatives) to `datetime` or `date`
fields causes validation to run forever with 100% CPU usage (on one
CPU). Pydantic has been patched with fixes available in the following
versions: v1.8.2, v1.7.4, v1.6.2. All these versions are available on
pypi(https://pypi.org/project/pydantic/#history), and will be
available on conda-forge(https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pydantic)
soon. See the changelog(https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) for
details. If you absolutely can't upgrade, you can work around this
risk using a validator(https://pydantic-
docs.helpmanual.io/usage/validators/) to catch these values. This is
not an ideal solution (in particular you'll need a slightly different
function for datetimes), instead of a hack like this you should
upgrade pydantic. If you are not using v1.8.x, v1.7.x or v1.6.x and
are unable to upgrade to a fixed version of pydantic, please create an
issue at https://github.com/samuelcolvin/pydantic/issues requesting a
back-port, and we will endeavour to release a patch for earlier
versions of pydantic.

evm is a pure Rust implementation of Ethereum Virtual Machine. Prior
to the patch, when executing specific EVM opcodes related to memory
operations that use `evm_core::Memory::copy_large`, the `evm` crate
can over-allocate memory when it is not needed, making it possible for
an attacker to perform denial-of-service attack. The flaw was
corrected in commit `19ade85`. Users should upgrade to `==0.21.1,
==0.23.1, ==0.24.1, ==0.25.1, >=0.26.1`. There are no workarounds.
Please upgrade your `evm` crate version.

If the `splits` argument of `RaggedBincount` does not specify a valid 
`SparseTensor`(https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/sparse/Sp
arseTensor), then an attacker can trigger a heap buffer overflow. This
will cause a read from outside the bounds of the `splits` tensor
buffer in the implementation of the `RaggedBincount` op(https://github

3a/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L430-L433). Before the `for`
loop, `batch_idx` is set to 0. The user controls the `splits` array,
making it contain only one element, 0. Thus, the code in the `while`
loop would increment `batch_idx` and then try to read `splits(1)`,
which is outside of bounds. The fix will be included in TensorFlow
2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
An attacker can trigger a null pointer dereference by providing an
invalid `permutation` to `tf.raw_ops.SparseMatrixSparseCholesky`. This
is because the implementation(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow

/sparse/sparse_cholesky_op.cc#L85-L86) fails to properly validate the
input arguments. Although `ValidateInputs` is called and there are
checks in the body of this function, the code proceeds to the next
line in `ValidateInputs` since `OP_REQUIRES`(https://github.com/tensor

the current function. Thus, the first validation condition that fails
in `ValidateInputs` will cause an early return from that function.

fix is to either explicitly check `context->status()` or to convert
`ValidateInputs` to return a `Status`. The fix will be included in

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
An attacker can trigger a `CHECK` fail in PNG encoding by providing an
empty input tensor as the pixel data. This is because the implementati

-L60) only validates that the total number of pixels in the image does
not overflow. Thus, an attacker can send an empty matrix for encoding.
However, if the tensor is empty, then the associated buffer is
`nullptr`. Hence, when calling `png::WriteImageToBuffer`(https://githu
b.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e312e0791ce486a80c9d23110841525c6f7c3

argument (i.e., `image.flat<T>().data()`) is `NULL`. This then
triggers the `CHECK_NOTNULL` in the first line of `png::WriteImageToBu

Since `image` is null, this results in `abort` being called after
printing the stacktrace. Effectively, this allows an attacker to mount
a denial of service attack. The fix will be included in TensorFlow

call a helper function after accessing array elements via a
`*_list[next_*]` pattern, followed by incrementing the `next_*` index.

instead of `OP_REQUIRES` to validate user controlled inputs. Whereas
`OP_REQUIRES` allows returning an error condition back to the user,
the `CHECK_*` macros result in a crash if the condition is false,
similar to `assert`. In this case, `height` is 0 from the `images`
input. This results in `max_box_row_clamp` being negative and the
assertion being falsified, followed by aborting program execution. The

to `tf.raw_ops.StringNGrams`. This is because the implementation(https

fails to consider corner cases where input would be split in such a
way that the generated tokens should only contain padding elements. If
input is such that `num_tokens` is 0, then, for `data_start_index=0`
(when left padding is present), the marked line would result in
reading `data[-1]`. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We
will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
An attacker can cause a heap buffer overflow in
`tf.raw_ops.RaggedTensorToTensor`. This is because the implementation(

TFlite graphs must not have loops between nodes. However, this
condition was not checked and an attacker could craft models that
would result in infinite loop during evaluation. In certain cases, the
infinite loop would be replaced by stack overflow due to too many
recursive calls. For example, the `While` implementation(https://githu

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
Incomplete validation in `SparseReshape` results in a denial of
service based on a `CHECK`-failure. The implementation(https://github.

that the input arguments specify a valid sparse tensor. The fix will
be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also cherrypick this commit
on TensorFlow 2.4.2 and TensorFlow 2.3.3, as these are the only

validate that the two tensors are not empty. Furthermore, since
`OP_REQUIRES` macro only stops execution of current function after
setting `ctx->status()` to a non-OK value, callers of helper functions
that use `OP_REQUIRES` must check value of `ctx->status()` before
continuing. This doesn't happen in this op's implementation(https://gi

TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.
The implementation of `tf.io.decode_raw` produces incorrect results
and crashes the Python interpreter when combining `fixed_length` and
wider datatypes. The implementation of the padded version(https://gith
ub.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781
d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc) is buggy due to
a confusion about pointer arithmetic rules. First, the code computes(h
ttps://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db
6e462daf781d1fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L61)
the width of each output element by dividing the `fixed_length` value
to the size of the type argument. The `fixed_length` argument is also
used to determine the size needed for the output tensor(https://github
.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/1d8903e5b167ed0432077a3db6e462daf781d1
fe/tensorflow/core/kernels/decode_padded_raw_op.cc#L63-L79). This is
followed by reencoding code(https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/b

ecode_padded_raw_op.cc#L85-L94). The erroneous code is the last line
above: it is moving the `out_data` pointer by `fixed_length *
sizeof(T)` bytes whereas it only copied at most `fixed_length` bytes
from the input. This results in parts of the input not being decoded
into the output. Furthermore, because the pointer advance is far wider
than desired, this quickly leads to writing to outside the bounds of
the backing data. This OOB write leads to interpreter crash in the
reproducer mentioned here, but more severe attacks can be mounted too,
given that this gadget allows writing to periodically placed locations
in memory. The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.5.0. We will also
cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.4.2, TensorFlow 2.3.3,

exploit the vulnerability to leak a few bytes of stack memory, if they
can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file. The
bug is fixed in version v0.27.4.

Adminer is open-source database management software. A cross-site
scripting vulnerability in Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 affects
users of MySQL, MariaDB, PgSQL and SQLite. XSS is in most cases
prevented by strict CSP in all modern browsers. The only exception is
when Adminer is using a `pdo_` extension to communicate with the
database (it is used if the native extensions are not enabled). In
browsers without CSP, Adminer versions 4.6.1 to 4.8.0 are affected.
The vulnerability is patched in version 4.8.1. As workarounds, one can
use a browser supporting strict CSP or enable the native PHP
extensions (e.g. `mysqli`) or disable displaying PHP errors
(`display_errors`).

** DISPUTED ** Laminas Project laminas-http before 2.14.2, and Zend
Framework 3.0.0, has a deserialization vulnerability that can lead to
remote code execution if the content is controllable, related to the
__destruct method of the Zend\Http\Response\Stream class in
Stream.php. NOTE: Zend Framework is no longer supported by the
maintainer. NOTE: the laminas-http vendor considers this a
"vulnerability in the PHP language itself" but has added certain type
checking as a way to prevent exploitation in (unrecommended) use cases
where attacker-supplied data can be deserialized.

Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows credential disclosure, as exploited in
the wild in July 2021. By default Kaseya VSA on premise offers a
download page where the clients for the installation can be
downloaded. The default URL for this page is https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp
When an attacker download a client for Windows and installs it, the
file KaseyaD.ini is generated (C:\Program Files
(x86)\Kaseya\XXXXXXXXXX\KaseyaD.ini) which contains an Agent_Guid and
AgentPassword This Agent_Guid and AgentPassword can be used to log in
on dl.asp (https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp?un=840997037507813&pw=113cc622839a40
77a84837485ced6b93e440bf66d44057713cb2f95e503a06d9) This request
authenticates the client and returns a sessionId cookie that can be
used in subsequent attacks to bypass authentication. Security issues
discovered --- * Unauthenticated download page leaks credentials *
Credentials of agent software can be used to obtain a sessionId
(cookie) that can be used for services not intended for use by agents
* dl.asp accepts credentials via a GET request * Access to KaseyaD.ini
gives an attacker access to sufficient information to penetrate the
Kaseya installation and its clients. Impact --- Via the page /dl.asp
enough information can be obtained to give an attacker a sessionId
that can be used to execute further (semi-authenticated) attacks
against the system.

An attacker can upload files with the privilege of the Web Server
process for Kaseya VSA Unified Remote Monitoring & Management (RMM)
9.5.4.2149 and subsequently use these files to execute asp commands
The api /SystemTab/uploader.aspx is vulnerable to an unauthenticated
arbitrary file upload leading to RCE. An attacker can upload files
with the privilege of the Web Server process and subsequently use
these files to execute asp commands. Detailed description --- Given
the following request: ``` POST /SystemTab/uploader.aspx?Filename=shel
lz.aspx&PathData=C%3A%5CKaseya%5CWebPages%5C&__RequestValidationToken=
ac1906a5-d511-47e3-8500-47cc4b0ec219&qqfile=shellz.aspx HTTP/1.1 Host:

const string password = "pass"; // The password ( pass ) private const
string style = "dark"; // The style ( light / dark ) protected void
Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { //this.Remote(password);
this.Login(password); this.Style(); this.ServerInfo(); <snip> ``` The
attacker can control the name of the file written via the qqfile
parameter and the location of the file written via the PathData
parameter. Even though the call requires that a sessionId cookie is
passed we have determined that the sessionId is not actually validated
and any numeric value is accepted as valid. Security issues discovered
--- * a sessionId cookie is required by /SystemTab/uploader.aspx, but
is not actually validated, allowing an attacker to bypass
authentication * /SystemTab/uploader.aspx allows an attacker to create
a file with arbitrary content in any place the webserver has write
access * The web server process has write access to the webroot where
the attacker can execute it by requesting the URL of the newly created
file. Impact --- This arbitrary file upload allows an attacker to
place files of his own choosing on any location on the hard drive of
the server the webserver process has access to, including (but not
limited to) the webroot. If the attacker uploads files with code to
the webroot (e.g. aspx code) he can then execute this code in the
context of the webserver to breach either the integrity,
confidentiality, or availability of the system or to steal credentials
of other users. In other words, this can lead to a full system
compromise.

Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows attackers to bypass the 2FA
requirement. The need to use 2FA for authentication in enforce client-
side instead of server-side and can be bypassed using a local proxy.
Thus rendering 2FA useless. Detailed description --- During the login
process, after the user authenticates with username and password, the
server sends a response to the client with the booleans MFARequired
and MFAEnroled. If the attacker has obtained a password of a user and
used an intercepting proxy (e.g. Burp Suite) to change the value of
MFARequered from True to False, there is no prompt for the second
factor, but the user is still logged in.

deleting pages in certain "fast double move" situations.
MovePage::isValidMoveTarget() uses FOR UPDATE, but it's only called if
Title::getArticleID() returns non-zero with no special flags. Next,
MovePage::moveToInternal() will delete the page if
getArticleID(READ_LATEST) is non-zero. Therefore, if the page is
missing in the replica DB, isValidMove() will return true, and then
moveToInternal() will unconditionally delete the page if it can be
found in the master.

Reference: MLIST:[dubbo-dev] 20210531 [CVE-2021-30179]Pre-auth RCE via Java deserialization in the Generic filter
Reference: URL:https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rccbcbdd6593e42ea3a1e8fedd12807cb111375c9c40edb005ef36f67@%3Cdev.dubbo.apache.org%3E

Apache Dubbo prior to 2.6.9 and 2.7.9 by default supports generic
calls to arbitrary methods exposed by provider interfaces. These
invocations are handled by the GenericFilter which will find the
service and method specified in the first arguments of the invocation
and use the Java Reflection API to make the final call. The signature
for the $invoke or $invokeAsync methods is
Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/String;[Ljava/lang/Object; where the
first argument is the name of the method to invoke, the second one is
an array with the parameter types for the method being invoked and the
third one is an array with the actual call arguments. In addition, the
caller also needs to set an RPC attachment specifying that the call is
a generic call and how to decode the arguments. The possible values
are: - true - raw.return - nativejava - bean - protobuf-json An
attacker can control this RPC attachment and set it to nativejava to
force the java deserialization of the byte array located in the third
argument.

The project received a report that all versions of Apache OpenOffice
through 4.1.8 can open non-http(s) hyperlinks. The problem has existed
since about 2006 and the issue is also in 4.1.9. If the link is
specifically crafted this could lead to untrusted code execution. It
is always best practice to be careful opening documents from unknown
and unverified sources. The mitigation in Apache OpenOffice 4.1.10
(unreleased) assures that a security warning is displayed giving the
user the option of continuing to open the hyperlink.

A vulnerability in Apache Tomcat allows an attacker to remotely
trigger a denial of service. An error introduced as part of a change
to improve error handling during non-blocking I/O meant that the error
flag associated with the Request object was not reset between
requests. This meant that once a non-blocking I/O error occurred, all
future requests handled by that request object would fail. Users were
able to trigger non-blocking I/O errors, e.g. by dropping a
connection, thereby creating the possibility of triggering a DoS.
Applications that do not use non-blocking I/O are not exposed to this
vulnerability. This issue affects Apache Tomcat 10.0.3 to 10.0.4;
9.0.44; 8.5.64.
