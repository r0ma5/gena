An arbitrary file upload vulnerability in the YITH WooCommerce Gift
Cards Premium plugin before 3.3.1 for WordPress allows remote
attackers to achieve remote code execution on the operating system in
the security context of the web server. In order to exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker must be able to place a valid Gift Card
product into the shopping cart. An uploaded file is placed at a
predetermined path on the web server with a user-specified filename
and extension. This occurs because the ywgc-upload-picture parameter
can have a .php value even though the intention was to only allow
uploads of Gift Card images.

In ASUS RT-AX3000, ZenWiFi AX (XT8), RT-AX88U, and other ASUS routers
with firmware < 3.0.0.4.386.42095 or < 9.0.0.4.386.41994, when IPv6 is
used, a routing loop can occur that generates excessive network
traffic between an affected device and its upstream ISP's router. This
occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a
destination IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6
address, and a router advertisement is received with at least one
global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set.

An Out Of Bounds (OOB) access vulnerability in the handling of
responses by a Juniper Agile License (JAL) Client in Juniper Networks
Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved, configured in Network Mode (to use
Juniper Agile License Manager) may allow an attacker to cause a
partial Denial of Service (DoS), or lead to remote code execution
(RCE). The vulnerability exists in the packet parsing logic on the
client that processes the response from the server using a custom
protocol. An attacker with control of a JAL License Manager, or with
access to the local broadcast domain, may be able to spoof a new JAL
License Manager and/or craft a response to the Junos OS License
Client, leading to exploitation of this vulnerability. This issue only
affects Junos systems configured in Network Mode. Systems that are
configured in Standalone Mode (the default mode of operation for all
systems) are not vulnerable to this issue. This issue affects: Juniper
Networks Junos OS: 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions

A command injection vulnerability in command processing on Juniper
Networks Junos OS Evolved allows an attacker with authenticated CLI
access to be able to bypass configured access protections to execute
arbitrary shell commands within the context of the current user. The
vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass command authorization
restrictions assigned to their specific user account and execute
commands that are available to the privilege level for which the user
is assigned. For example, a user that is in the super-user login
class, but restricted to executing specific CLI commands could exploit
the vulnerability to execute any other command available to an
unrestricted admin user. This vulnerability does not increase the
privilege level of the user, but rather bypasses any CLI command
restrictions by allowing full access to the shell. This issue affects
Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to

In broadband environments, including but not limited to Enhanced
Subscriber Management, (CHAP, PPP, DHCP, etc.), on Juniper Networks
Junos OS devices where RADIUS servers are configured for managing
subscriber access and a subscriber is logged in and then requests to
logout, the subscriber may be forced into a "Terminating" state by an
attacker who is able to send spoofed messages appearing to originate
from trusted RADIUS server(s) destined to the device in response to
the subscriber's request. These spoofed messages cause the Junos OS
General Authentication Service (authd) daemon to force the broadband
subscriber into this "Terminating" state which the subscriber will not
recover from thereby causing a Denial of Service (DoS) to the endpoint
device. Once in the "Terminating" state, the endpoint subscriber will
no longer be able to access the network. Restarting the authd daemon
on the Junos OS device will temporarily clear the subscribers out of
the "Terminating" state. As long as the attacker continues to send
these spoofed packets and subscribers request to be logged out, the
subscribers will be returned to the "Terminating" state thereby
creating a persistent Denial of Service to the subscriber. An
indicator of compromise may be seen by displaying the output of "show
subscribers summary". The presence of subscribers in the "Terminating"
state may indicate the issue is occurring. This issue affects: Juniper

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/13/5

In Open-iSCSI tcmu-runner 1.3.x, 1.4.x, and 1.5.x through 1.5.2,
xcopy_locate_udev in tcmur_cmd_handler.c lacks a check for transport-
layer restrictions, allowing remote attackers to read or write files
via directory traversal in an XCOPY request. For example, an attack
can occur over a network if the attacker has access to one iSCSI LUN.
NOTE: relative to CVE-2020-28374, this is a similar mistake in a
different algorithm.

An issue was discovered in tcp_pulloutofband() in tcp_in.c in HCC
embedded InterNiche 4.0.1. The TCP out-of-band urgent-data processing
function invokes a panic function if the pointer to the end of the
out-of-band data points outside of the TCP segment's data. If the
panic function hadn't a trap invocation removed, it will enter an
infinite loop and therefore cause DoS (continuous loop or a device
reset).

LookupCol.c in X.Org X through X11R7.7 and libX11 before 1.7.1 might
allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code. The libX11
XLookupColor request (intended for server-side color lookup) contains
a flaw allowing a client to send color-name requests with a name
longer than the maximum size allowed by the protocol (and also longer
than the maximum packet size for normal-sized packets). The user-
controlled data exceeding the maximum size is then interpreted by the
server as additional X protocol requests and executed, e.g., to
disable X server authorization completely. For example, if the victim
encounters malicious terminal control sequences for color codes, then
the attacker may be able to take full control of the running graphical
session.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/06/10/9

Apache HTTP Server protocol handler for the HTTP/2 protocol checks
received request headers against the size limitations as configured
for the server and used for the HTTP/1 protocol as well. On violation
of these restrictions and HTTP response is sent to the client with a
status code indicating why the request was rejected. This rejection
response was not fully initialised in the HTTP/2 protocol handler if
the offending header was the very first one received or appeared in a
a footer. This led to a NULL pointer dereference on initialised
memory, crashing reliably the child process. Since such a triggering
HTTP/2 request is easy to craft and submit, this can be exploited to
DoS the server. This issue affected mod_http2 1.15.17 and Apache HTTP
Server version 2.4.47 only. Apache HTTP Server 2.4.47 was never
released.

Multiple path traversal vulnerabilities exist in smbserver.py in
Impacket through 0.9.22. An attacker that connects to a running
smbserver instance can list and write to arbitrary files via ../
directory traversal. This could potentially be abused to achieve
arbitrary code execution by replacing /etc/shadow or an SSH authorized
key.

Reference: MISC:https://www.netgear.com/about/security/

NETGEAR R7000 1.0.11.116 devices have a heap-based Buffer Overflow
that is exploitable from the local network without authentication. The
vulnerability exists within the handling of an HTTP request. An
attacker can leverage this to execute code as root. The problem is
that a user-provided length value is trusted during a backup.cgi file
upload. The attacker must add a \n before the Content-Length header.

The fix issued for CVE-2020-17530 was incomplete. So from Apache
Struts 2.0.0 to 2.5.29, still some of the tag&#8217;s attributes could
perform a double evaluation if a developer applied forced OGNL
evaluation by using the %{...} syntax. Using forced OGNL evaluation on
untrusted user input can lead to a Remote Code Execution and security
degradation.

rfc822.c in Mutt through 2.0.4 allows remote attackers to cause a
denial of service (mailbox unavailability) by sending email messages
with sequences of semicolon characters in RFC822 address fields (aka
terminators of empty groups). A small email message from the attacker
can cause large memory consumption, and the victim may then be unable
to see email messages from other persons.

KDE Messagelib through 5.17.0 reveals cleartext of encrypted messages
in some situations. Deleting an attachment of a decrypted encrypted
message stored on a remote server (e.g., an IMAP server) causes KMail
to upload the decrypted content of the message to the remote server.
With a crafted message, a user could be tricked into decrypting an
encrypted message and then deleting an attachment attached to this
message. If the attacker has access to the messages stored on the
email server, then the attacker could read the decrypted content of
the encrypted message. This occurs in ViewerPrivate::deleteAttachment
in messageviewer/src/viewer/viewer_p.cpp.

Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 through 0.21.1 does not properly implement the
replacement policy specified in BIP125, which makes it easier for
attackers to trigger a loss of funds, or a denial of service attack
against downstream projects such as Lightning network nodes. An
unconfirmed child transaction with nSequence = 0xff_ff_ff_ff, spending
an unconfirmed parent with nSequence <= 0xff_ff_ff_fd, should be
replaceable because there is inherited signaling by the child
transaction. However, the actual PreChecks implementation does not
enforce this. Instead, mempool rejects the replacement attempt of the
unconfirmed child transaction.

Reference: MISC:https://www.yubico.com/support/security-advisories/ysa-2021-03

Yubico pam-u2f before 1.1.1 has a logic issue that, depending on the
pam-u2f configuration and the application used, could lead to a local
PIN bypass. This issue does not allow user presence (touch) or
cryptographic signature verification to be bypassed, so an attacker
would still need to physically possess and interact with the YubiKey
or another enrolled authenticator. If pam-u2f is configured to require
PIN authentication, and the application using pam-u2f allows the user
to submit NULL as the PIN, pam-u2f will attempt to perform a FIDO2
authentication without PIN. If this authentication is successful, the
PIN requirement is bypassed.

into a signed SAML response being transmitted to the service provider
(ID Bravura Security Fabric). The application successfully validates
the signed values but uses the unsigned malicious values. An attacker
with lower-privilege access to the application can inject the username
of a high-privilege user to impersonate that user.

Protectimus SLIM NFC 70 10.01 devices allow a Time Traveler attack in
which attackers can predict TOTP passwords in certain situations. The
time value used by the device can be set independently from the used
seed value for generating time-based one-time passwords, without
authentication. Thus, an attacker with short-time physical access to a
device can set the internal real-time clock (RTC) to the future,
generate one-time passwords, and reset the clock to the current time.
This allows the generation of valid future time-based one-time
passwords without having further access to the hardware token.

SICK Visionary-S CX up version 5.21.2.29154R are vulnerable to an
Inadequate Encryption Strength vulnerability concerning the internal
SSH interface solely used by SICK for recovering returned devices. The
use of weak ciphers make it easier for an attacker to break the
security that protects information transmitted from the client to the
SSH server, assuming the attacker has access to the network on which
the device is connected. This can increase the risk that encryption
will be compromised, leading to the exposure of sensitive user
information and man-in-the-middle attacks.

Missing input validation in internal/db/repo_editor.go in Gogs before
0.12.8 allows an attacker to execute code remotely. An unprivileged
attacker (registered user) can overwrite the Git configuration in his
repository. This leads to Remote Command Execution, because that
configuration can contain an option such as sshCommand, which is
executed when a master branch is a remote branch (using an ssh://
URI). The remote branch can also be configured by editing the Git
configuration file. One can create a new file in a new repository,
using the GUI, with "\" as its name, and then rename this file to
.git/config with the custom configuration content (and then save it).

A flaw was found in dmg2img through 20170502. fill_mishblk() does not
check the length of the read buffer, and copy 0xCC bytes from it. The
length of the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a
length smaller than 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound.
This possibly leads to memory layout information leaking in the data.
This might be used in a chain of vulnerability in order to reach code
execution.

Exiv2 is a command-line utility and C++ library for reading, writing,
deleting, and modifying the metadata of image files. An inefficient
algorithm (quadratic complexity) was found in Exiv2 versions v0.27.3
and earlier. The inefficient algorithm is triggered when Exiv2 is used
to write metadata into a crafted image file. An attacker could
potentially exploit the vulnerability to cause a denial of service, if
they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a crafted image file.
The bug is fixed in version v0.27.4. Note that this bug is only
triggered when _writing_ the metadata, which is a less frequently used
Exiv2 operation than _reading_ the metadata. For example, to trigger
the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you need to add an
extra command-line argument such as `rm`.

The Python "Flask-Security-Too" package is used for adding security
features to your Flask application. It is an is an independently
maintained version of Flask-Security based on the 3.0.0 version of
Flask-Security. All versions of Flask-Security-Too allow redirects
after many successful views (e.g. /login) by honoring the ?next query
param. There is code in FS to validate that the url specified in the
next parameter is either relative OR has the same netloc (network
location) as the requesting URL. This check utilizes Pythons urlsplit
library. However many browsers are very lenient on the kind of URL
they accept and 'fill in the blanks' when presented with a possibly
incomplete URL. As a concrete example - setting
http://login?next=\\\github.com will pass FS's relative URL check
however many browsers will gladly convert this to http://github.com.
Thus an attacker could send such a link to an unwitting user, using a
legitimate site and have it redirect to whatever site they want. This
is considered a low severity due to the fact that if Werkzeug is used
(which is very common with Flask applications) as the WSGI layer, it
by default ALWAYS ensures that the Location header is absolute - thus
making this attack vector mute. It is possible for application writers
to modify this default behavior by setting the
'autocorrect_location_header=False`.

vulnerable to the billion laughs attack, which allows an attacker to
easily execute a (seemingly permanent) denial of service attack,
essentially taking down Opencast using a single HTTP request. To
exploit this, users need to have ingest privileges, limiting the group
of potential attackers The problem has been fixed in Opencast 9.6.

Keystone 5 is an open source CMS platform to build Node.js
applications. This security advisory relates to a newly discovered
capability in our query infrastructure to directly or indirectly
expose the values of private fields, bypassing the configured access
control. This is an access control related oracle attack in that the
attack method guides an attacker during their attempt to reveal
information they do not have access to. The complexity of completing
the attack is limited by some length-dependent behaviors and the
fidelity of the exposed information. Under some circumstances, field
values or field value meta data can be determined, despite the field
or list having `read` access control configured. If you use private
fields or lists, you may be impacted. No patches exist at this time.
There are no workarounds at this time

Redis is an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure
store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. An integer
overflow bug in Redis version 6.0 or newer, could be exploited using
the STRALGO LCS command to corrupt the heap and potentially result
with remote code execution. This is a result of an incomplete fix by
CVE-2021-29477. The problem is fixed in version 6.2.4 and 6.0.14. An
additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
redis-server executable is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients
from using the STRALGO LCS command. On 64 bit systems which have the
fixes of CVE-2021-29477 (6.2.3 or 6.0.13), it is sufficient to make
sure that the proto-max-bulk-len config parameter is smaller than 2GB
(default is 512MB).

Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. In
affected versions specially crafted Lua scripts executing in Redis can
cause the heap-based Lua stack to be overflowed, due to incomplete
checks for this condition. This can result with heap corruption and
potentially remote code execution. This problem exists in all versions
of Redis with Lua scripting support, starting from 2.6. The problem is
fixed in versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users unable to update
an additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
redis-server executable is to prevent users from executing Lua
scripts. This can be done using ACL to restrict EVAL and EVALSHA
commands.

The problem is fixed in Redis 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. For users
unable to upgrade an additional workaround to mitigate the problem
without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent users from
modifying the proto-max-bulk-len configuration parameter. This can be

Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An
integer overflow bug in the ziplist data structure used by all
versions of Redis can be exploited to corrupt the heap and potentially
result with remote code execution. The vulnerability involves
modifying the default ziplist configuration parameters (hash-max-
ziplist-entries, hash-max-ziplist-value, zset-max-ziplist-entries or
zset-max-ziplist-value) to a very large value, and then constructing
specially crafted commands to create very large ziplists. The problem
is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16, 5.0.14. An additional
workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the redis-server
executable is to prevent users from modifying the above configuration
parameters. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users
from using the CONFIG SET command.

Cranelift is an open-source code generator maintained by Bytecode
Alliance. It translates a target-independent intermediate
representation into executable machine code. There is a bug in 0.73 of
the Cranelift x64 backend that can create a scenario that could result
in a potential sandbox escape in a Wasm program. This bug was
introduced in the new backend on 2020-09-08 and first included in a
release on 2020-09-30, but the new backend was not the default prior
to 0.73. The recently-released version 0.73 with default settings, and
prior versions with an explicit build flag to select the new backend,
are vulnerable. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of
a zero-extend on a value loaded from the stack, under a specific set
of circumstances. If those circumstances occur, the bug could allow
access to memory addresses upto 2GiB before the start of the Wasm
program heap. If the heap bound is larger than 2GiB, then it would be
possible to read memory from a computable range dependent on the size
of the heaps bound. The impact of this bug is highly dependent on heap
implementation, specifically: * if the heap has bounds checks, and *
does not rely exclusively on guard pages, and * the heap bound is 2GiB
or smaller * then this bug cannot be used to reach memory from another
Wasm program heap. The impact of the vulnerability is mitigated if
there is no memory mapped in the range accessible using this bug, for
example, if there is a 2 GiB guard region before the Wasm program
heap. The bug in question performs a sign-extend instead of a zero-
extend on a value loaded from the stack, when the register allocator
reloads a spilled integer value narrower than 64 bits. This interacts
poorly with another optimization: the instruction selector elides a
32-to-64-bit zero-extend operator when we know that an instruction
producing a 32-bit value actually zeros the upper 32 bits of its
destination register. Hence, we rely on these zeroed bits, but the
type of the value is still i32, and the spill/reload reconstitutes
those bits as the sign extension of the i32&#8217;s MSB. The issue would
thus occur when: * An i32 value in a Wasm program is greater than or
equal to 0x8000_0000; * The value is spilled and reloaded by the
register allocator due to high register pressure in the program
between the value&#8217;s definition and its use; * The value is produced by
an instruction that we know to be &#8220;special&#8221; in that it zeroes the
upper 32 bits of its destination: add, sub, mul, and, or; * The value
is then zero-extended to 64 bits in the Wasm program; * The resulting
64-bit value is used. Under these circumstances there is a potential
sandbox escape when the i32 value is a pointer. The usual code emitted
for heap accesses zero-extends the Wasm heap address, adds it to a
64-bit heap base, and accesses the resulting address. If the zero-
extend becomes a sign-extend, the program could reach backward and
access memory up to 2GiB before the start of its heap. In addition to
assessing the nature of the code generation bug in Cranelift, we have
also determined that under specific circumstances, both Lucet and
Wasmtime using this version of Cranelift may be exploitable. See
referenced GitHub Advisory for more details.

Zope is an open-source web application server. In Zope versions prior
to 4.6 and 5.2, users can access untrusted modules indirectly through
Python modules that are available for direct use. By default, only
users with the Manager role can add or edit Zope Page Templates
through the web, but sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit Zope
Page Templates through the web are at risk from this vulnerability.
The problem has been fixed in Zope 5.2 and 4.6. As a workaround, a
site administrator can restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates
through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission
mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager
role and adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web should be
restricted to trusted users only.

Singularity is an open source container platform. In verions 3.7.2 and
3.7.3, Dde to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action
commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a
`library://` URI will always attempt to retrieve the container from
the default remote endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the
configured remote endpoint. An attacker may be able to push a
malicious container to the default remote endpoint with a URI that is
identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-default remote
endpoint, thus executing the malicious container. Only action commands
(`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected. Other
commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remote
endpoint. The vulnerability is patched in Singularity version 3.7.4.
Two possible workarounds exist: Users can only interact with the
default remote endpoint, or an installation can have an execution
control list configured to restrict execution to containers signed
with specific secure keys.

Authelia is a a single sign-on multi-factor portal for web apps. This
affects uses who are using nginx ngx_http_auth_request_module with
Authelia, it allows a malicious individual who crafts a malformed HTTP
request to bypass the authentication mechanism. It additionally could
theoretically affect other proxy servers, but all of the ones we
officially support except nginx do not allow malformed URI paths. The
problem is rectified entirely in v4.29.3. As this patch is relatively
straightforward we can back port this to any version upon request.
Alternatively we are supplying a git patch to 4.25.1 which should be
relatively straightforward to apply to any version, the git patches
for specific versions can be found in the references. The most
relevant workaround is upgrading. You can also add a block which fails
requests that contains a malformed URI in the internal location block.

Github's CodeQL action is provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning
on non-GitHub CI/CD systems and requires a GitHub access token to
connect to a GitHub repository. The runner and its documentation
previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line
parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard
input, or an environment variable. This approach made the token
visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the
output of the `ps` command. If the CI system publicly exposes the
output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub
access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended. Users of the
CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via
the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both
GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users. Users of the CodeQL Action on
GitHub Actions are not affected. The `--github-auth` flag is now
considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-
repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub
access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the
following instead**: Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the
token on the command line via standard input OR set the `GITHUB_TOKEN`
environment variable to contain the token, then call the command
without passing in the token. The old flag remains present for
backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to
specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a
deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to
one of the above options. All CodeQL runner releases codeql-
bundle-20210304 onwards contain the patches. We recommend updating to
a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI
system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL
runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment
variable. If still using the old flag, ensure that process output,
such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.

radsecproxy is a generic RADIUS proxy that supports both UDP and TLS
(RadSec) RADIUS transports. Missing input validation in radsecproxy's
`naptr-eduroam.sh` and `radsec-dynsrv.sh` scripts can lead to
configuration injection via crafted radsec peer discovery DNS records.
Users are subject to Information disclosure, Denial of Service,
Redirection of Radius connection to a non-authenticated server leading
to non-authenticated network access. Updated example scripts are
available in the master branch and 1.9 release. Note that the scripts
are not part of the installation package and are not updated
automatically. If you are using the examples, you have to update them
manually. The dyndisc scripts work independently of the radsecproxy
code. The updated scripts can be used with any version of radsecproxy.

Http4s is a Scala interface for HTTP services. `StaticFile.fromUrl`
can leak the presence of a directory on a server when the `URL` scheme
is not `file://`, and the URL points to a fetchable resource under its
scheme and authority. The function returns `F[None]`, indicating no
resource, if `url.getFile` is a directory, without first checking the
scheme or authority of the URL. If a URL connection to the scheme and
URL would return a stream, and the path in the URL exists as a
directory on the server, the presence of the directory on the server
could be inferred from the 404 response. The contents and other
metadata about the directory are not exposed. This affects http4s
versions: 0.21.7 through 0.21.23, 0.22.0-M1 through 0.22.0-M8,
0.23.0-M1, and 1.0.0-M1 through 1.0.0-M22. The [patch](https://github.

available in the following versions: v0.21.24, v0.22.0-M9, v0.23.0-M2,

`StaticFile.fromUrl` with non-file URLs.

Tenancy multi-tenant is an open source multi-domain controller for the
Laravel web framework. In some situations, it is possible to have open
redirects where users can be redirected from your site to any other
site using a specially crafted URL. This is only the case for
installations where the default Hostname Identification is used and
the environment uses tenants that have `force_https` set to `true`
(default: `false`). Version 5.7.2 contains the relevant patches to fix
this bug. Stripping the URL from special characters to prevent
specially crafted URL's from being redirected to. As a work around
users can set the `force_https` to every tenant to `false`, however
this may degrade connection security.

Roomer is a discord bot cog (extension) which provides automatic voice
channel generation as well as private voice and text channels. A
vulnerability has been discovered allowing discord users to get the
``manage channel`` permissions in a private VC they have joined. This
allowed them to make changes to or delete the voice channel they have
taken over. The exploit does not allow access or control to any other
channels in the server. Upgrade to version 1.0.1 for a patched version
of the cog. As a workaround you may disable private VCs in your
guild(server) or unload the roomer cog to render the exploit unusable.

Emissary is a P2P based data-driven workflow engine. Affected versions
of Emissary are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code
Execution (RCE). The [`CreatePlace`](https://github.com/NationalSecuri

endpoint accepts an `sppClassName` parameter which is used to load an
arbitrary class. This class is later instantiated using a constructor
with the following signature: `<constructor>(String, String, String)`.
An attacker may find a gadget (class) in the application classpath
that could be used to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) or disrupt
the application. Even though the chances to find a gadget (class) that
allow arbitrary code execution are low, an attacker can still find
gadgets that could potentially crash the application or leak sensitive
data. As a work around disable network access to Emissary from
untrusted sources.

Matrix-appservice-bridge is the bridging service for the Matrix
communication program's application services. In versions 2.6.0 and
earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the
configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new
`Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will
be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room.
However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to
verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This
means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the
traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions
2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the
automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the
`roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options.

TechDocs. In versions of `@backstage/tehdocs-common` prior to 0.6.4, a
malicious internal actor is able to upload documentation content with

TechDocs frontend, but by tricking a user to visit the content via the
TechDocs API, the content sanitazion will be bypassed. If the TechDocs
API is hosted on the same origin as the Backstage app or other backend
plugins, this may give access to sensitive data. The ability to upload
malicious content may be limited by internal code review processes,

object store and the actor has access to upload files directly to that
store. The vulnerability is patched in the `0.9.5` release of

Backstage is an open platform for building developer portals, and
techdocs-common contains common functionalities for Backstage's
TechDocs. In `@backstage/techdocs-common` versions prior to 0.6.3, a
malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where
TechDocs documentation is built and published by setting a particular
path for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`. These files would then be
available over the TechDocs backend API. This vulnerability is
mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need access to modify the
`mkdocs.yml` in the documentation source code, and would also need
access to the TechDocs backend API. The vulnerability is patched in
the `0.6.3` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`.

Flarum is a forum software for building communities. Flarum's
translation system allowed for string inputs to be converted into HTML
DOM nodes when rendered. This change was made after v0.1.0-beta.16
(our last beta before v1.0.0) and was not noticed or documented. This
allowed for any user to type malicious HTML markup within certain user
input fields and have this execute on client browsers. The example
which led to the discovery of this vulnerability was in the forum
search box. Entering faux-malicious HTML markup, such as
<script>alert('test')</script> resulted in an alert box appearing on
the forum. This attack could also be modified to perform AJAX requests
on behalf of a user, possibly deleting discussions, modifying their
settings or profile, or even modifying settings on the Admin panel if
the attack was targetted towards a privileged user. All Flarum
communities that run flarum v1.0.0 or v1.0.1 are impacted. The
vulnerability has been fixed and published as flarum/core v1.0.2. All
communities running Flarum v1.0 have to upgrade as soon as possible to
v1.0.2.

Zope is an open-source web application server. This advisory extends
the previous advisory at https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/securi
ty/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36 with additional cases of TAL
expression traversal vulnerabilities. Most Python modules are not
available for using in TAL expressions that you can add through-the-
web, for example in Zope Page Templates. This restriction avoids file
system access, for example via the 'os' module. But some of the
untrusted modules are available indirectly through Python modules that
are available for direct use. By default, you need to have the Manager
role to add or edit Zope Page Templates through the web. Only sites
that allow untrusted users to add/edit Zope Page Templates through the
web are at risk. The problem has been fixed in Zope 5.2.1 and 4.6.1.
The workaround is the same as for https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zo
pe/security/advisories/GHSA-5pr9-v234-jw36: A site administrator can
restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web using the
standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should
not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page
Templates through the web should be restricted to trusted users only.

Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk.
When parsing an incoming Redis Standard Protocol (RESP) request, Redis
allocates memory according to user-specified values which determine
the number of elements (in the multi-bulk header) and size of each
element (in the bulk header). An attacker delivering specially crafted
requests over multiple connections can cause the server to allocate
significant amount of memory. Because the same parsing mechanism is
used to handle authentication requests, this vulnerability can also be
exploited by unauthenticated users. The problem is fixed in Redis
versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to
mitigate this problem without patching the redis-server executable is
to block access to prevent unauthenticated users from connecting to
Redis. This can be done in different ways: Using network access
control tools like firewalls, iptables, security groups, etc. or
Enabling TLS and requiring users to authenticate using client side
certificates.

FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on
standard Python type hints. FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that
used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON
payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request
Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would
try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type
header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media
type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of
text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data
would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt
from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The
browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text
content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by
the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request
data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is
application/json or another JSON compatible media type like
application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but
if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that
checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not
application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a
mitigating workaround.

Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage. In
versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3, ratelimits are not
applied to OCS API responses. This affects any OCS API controller
(`OCSController`) using the `@BruteForceProtection` annotation. Risk
depends on the installed applications on the Nextcloud Server, but
could range from bypassing authentication ratelimits or spamming other
Nextcloud users. The vulnerability is patched in versions 19.0.13,
20.0.11, and 21.0.3. No workarounds aside from upgrading are known to
exist.

Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage. In
versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3, filenames where not
escaped by default in controllers using `DownloadResponse`. When a
user-supplied filename was passed unsanitized into a
`DownloadResponse`, this could be used to trick users into downloading
malicious files with a benign file extension. This would show in UI
behaviours where Nextcloud applications would display a benign file
extension (e.g. JPEG), but the file will actually be downloaded with
an executable file extension. The vulnerability is patched in versions
19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. Administrators of Nextcloud instances do
not have a workaround available, but developers of Nextcloud apps may
manually escape the file name before passing it into
`DownloadResponse`.

Wagtail is an open source content management system built on Django. A
cross-site scripting vulnerability exists in versions 2.13-2.13.1,
versions 2.12-2.12.4, and versions prior to 2.11.8. When the `{%
include_block %}` template tag is used to output the value of a plain-
text StreamField block (`CharBlock`, `TextBlock` or a similar user-
defined block derived from `FieldBlock`), and that block does not
specify a template for rendering, the tag output is not properly
escaped as HTML. This could allow users to insert arbitrary HTML or
scripting. This vulnerability is only exploitable by users with the
ability to author StreamField content (i.e. users with 'editor' access
to the Wagtail admin). Patched versions have been released as Wagtail
2.11.8 (for the LTS 2.11 branch), Wagtail 2.12.5, and Wagtail 2.13.2
(for the current 2.13 branch). As a workaround, site implementors who
are unable to upgrade to a current supported version should audit
their use of `{% include_block %}` to ensure it is not used to output
`CharBlock` / `TextBlock` values with no associated template. Note
that this only applies where `{% include_block %}` is used directly on
that block (uses of `include_block` on a block _containing_ a
CharBlock / TextBlock, such as a StructBlock, are unaffected). In
these cases, the tag can be replaced with Django's `{{ ... }}` syntax
- e.g. `{% include_block my_title_block %}` becomes `{{ my_title_block
}}`.

PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library
written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as
SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In PJSIP before version 2.11.1,
there are a couple of issues found in the SSL socket. First, a race
condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted socket
having no group lock. Second, the SSL socket parent/listener may get
destroyed during handshake. Both issues were reported to happen
intermittently in heavy load TLS connections. They cause a crash,
resulting in a denial of service. These are fixed in version 2.11.1.

Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. An
integer overflow bug affecting all versions of Redis can be exploited
to corrupt the heap and potentially be used to leak arbitrary contents
of the heap or trigger remote code execution. The vulnerability
involves changing the default set-max-intset-entries configuration
parameter to a very large value and constructing specially crafted
commands to manipulate sets. The problem is fixed in Redis versions
6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14. An additional workaround to mitigate the
problem without patching the redis-server executable is to prevent
users from modifying the set-max-intset-entries configuration
parameter. This can be done using ACL to restrict unprivileged users
from using the CONFIG SET command.

Nextcloud Server is a Nextcloud package that handles data storage.
Nextcloud Server supports application specific tokens for
authentication purposes. These tokens are supposed to be granted to a
specific applications (e.g. DAV sync clients), and can also be
configured by the user to not have any filesystem access. Due to a
lacking permission check, the tokens were able to change their own
permissions in versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3. Thus
fileystem limited tokens were able to grant themselves access to the
filesystem. The issue is patched in versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and
21.0.3. There are no known workarounds aside from upgrading.

for another domain being used that could have received the
credentials. In the `index.yaml` file for that repository, one may
look for another domain in the `urls` list for the chart versions. If
there is another domain found and that chart version was pulled or

5.3.2. When an application defines multiple firewalls, the token
authenticated by one of the firewalls was available for all other
firewalls. This could be abused when the application defines different
providers for each part of the application, in such a situation, a
user authenticated on a part of the application could be considered
authenticated on the rest of the application. Starting in version
5.3.2, a patch ensures that the authenticated token is only available
for the firewall that generates it.

The npm package "striptags" is an implementation of PHP's strip_tags
in Typescript. In striptags before version 3.2.0, a type-confusion
vulnerability can cause `striptags` to concatenate unsanitized strings
when an array-like object is passed in as the `html` parameter. This
can be abused by an attacker who can control the shape of their input,
e.g. if query parameters are passed directly into the function. This
can lead to a XSS.

neos/forms is an open source framework to build web forms. By crafting
a special `GET` request containing a valid form state, a form can be
submitted without invoking any validators. Form state is secured with
an HMAC that is still verified. That means that this issue can only be
exploited if Form Finishers cause side effects even if no form values
have been sent. Form Finishers can be adjusted in a way that they only
execute an action if the submitted form contains some expected data.
Alternatively a custom Finisher can be added as first finisher. This
regression was introduced with https://github.com/neos/form/commit/049

Wings is the control plane software for the open source Pterodactyl
game management system. All versions of Pterodactyl Wings prior to
`1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper
container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume
more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other
clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server
to stop responding. Users should upgrade to `1.4.4` to mitigate the
issue. There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of
the software. Users running customized versions of this software can
manually set a PID limit for containers created.

ORY Oathkeeper is an Identity & Access Proxy (IAP) and Access Control
Decision API that authorizes HTTP requests based on sets of Access
Rules. When you make a request to an endpoint that requires the scope
`foo` using an access token granted with that `foo` scope,
introspection will be valid and that token will be cached. The problem
comes when a second requests to an endpoint that requires the scope
`bar` is made before the cache has expired. Whether the token is
granted or not to the `bar` scope, introspection will be valid. A
patch will be released with `v0.38.12-beta.1`. Per default, caching is
disabled for the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator. When caching is
disabled, this vulnerability does not exist. The cache is checked in
[`func (a *AuthenticatorOAuth2Introspection) Authenticate(...)`](https
://github.com/ory/oathkeeper/blob/6a31df1c3779425e05db1c2a381166b087cb

expiration date, but ignores whether the token has or not the proper
scopes. The vulnerability was introduced in PR #424. During review, we
failed to require appropriate test coverage by the submitter which is
the primary reason that the vulnerability passed the review process.

`1.4.1` are vulnerable to reflected XSS. An attacker can execute
arbitrary code by providing an XSS payload in the `error` query
parameter which is then processed by the callback handler as an error
message. You are affected by this vulnerability if you are using
`@auth0/nextjs-auth0` version `1.4.1` or lower **unless** you are
using custom error handling that does not return the error message in
an HTML response. Upgrade to version `1.4.1` to resolve. The fix adds
basic HTML escaping to the error message and it should not impact your

DHIS 2 is an information system for data capture, management,
validation, analytics and visualization. A SQL injection security
vulnerability has been found in specific versions of DHIS2. This
vulnerability affects the /api/trackedEntityInstances API endpoint in
DHIS2 versions 2.34.4, 2.35.2, 2.35.3, 2.35.4, and 2.36.0. Earlier
versions, such as 2.34.3 and 2.35.1 and all versions 2.33 and older
are unaffected. The system is vulnerable to attack only from users
that are logged in to DHIS2, and there is no known way of exploiting
the vulnerability without first being logged in as a DHIS2 user. A
successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow the malicious
user to read, edit and delete data in the DHIS2 instance. There are no
known exploits of the security vulnerabilities addressed by these
patch releases. However, we strongly recommend that all DHIS2
implementations using versions 2.34, 2.35 and 2.36 install these
patches as soon as possible. There is no straightforward known
workaround for DHIS2 instances using the Tracker functionality other
than upgrading the affected DHIS2 server to one of the patches in
which this vulnerability has been fixed. For implementations which do
NOT use Tracker functionality, it may be possible to block all network
access to POST to the /api/trackedEntityInstance endpoint as a
temporary workaround while waiting to upgrade.

Flysystem is an open source file storage library for PHP. The
whitespace normalisation using in 1.x and 2.x removes any unicode
whitespace. Under certain specific conditions this could potentially
allow a malicious user to execute code remotely. The conditions are: A
user is allowed to supply the path or filename of an uploaded file,
the supplied path or filename is not checked against unicode chars,
the supplied pathname checked against an extension deny-list, not an
allow-list, the supplied path or filename contains a unicode
whitespace char in the extension, the uploaded file is stored in a
directory that allows PHP code to be executed. Given these conditions
are met a user can upload and execute arbitrary code on the system
under attack. The unicode whitespace removal has been replaced with a
rejection (exception). For 1.x users, upgrade to 1.1.4. For 2.x users,
upgrade to 2.1.1.

hyper is an HTTP library for Rust. In versions prior to 0.14.10,
hyper's HTTP server and client code had a flaw that could trigger an
integer overflow when decoding chunk sizes that are too big. This
allows possible data loss, or if combined with an upstream HTTP proxy
that allows chunk sizes larger than hyper does, can result in "request
smuggling" or "desync attacks." The vulnerability is patched in
version 0.14.10. Two possible workarounds exist. One may reject
requests manually that contain a `Transfer-Encoding` header or ensure
any upstream proxy rejects `Transfer-Encoding` chunk sizes greater
than what fits in 64-bit unsigned integers.

hyper is an HTTP library for rust. hyper's HTTP/1 server code had a
flaw that incorrectly parses and accepts requests with a `Content-
Length` header with a prefixed plus sign, when it should have been
rejected as illegal. This combined with an upstream HTTP proxy that
doesn't parse such `Content-Length` headers, but forwards them, can
result in "request smuggling" or "desync attacks". The flaw exists in
all prior versions of hyper prior to 0.14.10, if built with `rustc`
v1.5.0 or newer. The vulnerability is patched in hyper version
0.14.10. Two workarounds exist: One may reject requests manually that
contain a plus sign prefix in the `Content-Length` header or ensure
any upstream proxy handles `Content-Length` headers with a plus sign
prefix.

Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce platform on top of Symfony. In
versions of Sylius prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details
(order ID, order number, items total, and token value) of all placed
orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly, a
few additional information like the number of items in the cart and
the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to
not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could be used for
sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop
condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the
number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. The
problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1. There are a
few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is
to hide the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged
in users. This would put only the order list under the firewall and
allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized,
it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible
solution is to decorate the `\Sylius\Bundle\ApiBundle\Doctrine\QueryCo
llectionExtension\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw
`Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AccessDeniedException` if
the class is executed for unauthorized user.

check-spelling is a github action which provides CI spell checking. In
affected versions and for a repository with the [check-spelling
action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/check-spelling) enabled
that triggers on `pull_request_target` (or `schedule`), an attacker
can send a crafted Pull Request that causes a `GITHUB_TOKEN` to be
exposed. With the `GITHUB_TOKEN`, it's possible to push commits to the
repository bypassing standard approval processes. Commits to the
repository could then steal any/all secrets available to the
repository. As a workaround users may can either: [Disable the
workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-
runs/disabling-and-enabling-a-workflow) until you've fixed all
branches or Set repository to [Allow specific
actions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-
repository/managing-repository-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-
actions-for-a-repository#allowing-specific-actions-to-run). check-
spelling isn't a verified creator and it certainly won't be anytime
soon. You could then explicitly add other actions that your repository
uses. Set repository [Workflow
permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-
repository/managing-repository-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-
actions-for-a-repository#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-
for-your-repository) to `Read repository contents permission`.
Workflows using `check-spelling/check-spelling@main` will get the fix
automatically. Workflows using a pinned sha or tagged version will
need to change the affected workflows for all repository branches to
the latest version. Users can verify who and which Pull Requests have
been running the action by looking up the spelling.yml action in the
Actions tab of their repositories, e.g., https://github.com/check-
spelling/check-spelling/actions/workflows/spelling.yml - you can
filter PRs by adding ?query=event%3Apull_request_target, e.g.,

checking if a private key belonged to a previously downloaded public
certificate. If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key,
the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. A cross-site request forgery
vulnerability exists in versions prior to 12.10.5, and in versions
13.0 through 13.1. It's possible for forge an URL that, when accessed
by an admin, will reset the password of any user in XWiki. The problem
has been patched in XWiki 12.10.5 and 13.2RC1. As a workaround, it is
possible to apply the patch manually by modifying the
`register_macros.vm` template.

13.1RC1 and 13.1, the reset password form reveals the email address of
users just by giving their username. The problem has been patched on

### Impact It's possible to know if a user has or not an account in a
wiki related to an email address, and which username(s) is actually
tied to that email by forging a request to the Forgot username page.
Note that since this page does not have a CSRF check it's quite easy
to perform a lot of those requests. ### Patches This issue has been
patched in XWiki 12.10.5 and 13.2RC1. Two different patches are
provided: - a first one to fix the CSRF problem - a more complex one
that now relies on sending an email for the Forgot username process.
### Workarounds It's possible to fix the problem without uprading by
editing the ForgotUsername page in version below 13.x, to use the
following code: https://github.com/xwiki/xwiki-
platform/blob/69548c0320cbd772540cf4668743e69f879812cf/xwiki-platform-
core/xwiki-platform-administration/xwiki-platform-administration-
ui/src/main/resources/XWiki/ForgotUsername.xml#L39-L123 In version
after 13.x it's also possible to edit manually the forgotusername.vm
file, but it's really encouraged to upgrade the version here. ###

Kirby is a content management system. In Kirby CMS versions 3.5.5 and
3.5.6, the Panel's `ListItem` component (used in the pages and files
section for example) displayed HTML in page titles as it is. This
could be used for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Malicious
authenticated Panel users can escalate their privileges if they get
access to the Panel session of an admin user. Visitors without Panel
access can use the attack vector if the site allows changing site data
from a frontend form. Kirby 3.5.7 patches the vulnerability. As a

Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network
resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data
for reporting. From version 2.4.0 through version 2.12.4, a
vulnerability exists that may allow privilege escalation for
authenticated API users. With a read-ony user's credentials, an
attacker can view most attributes of all config objects including
`ticket_salt` of `ApiListener`. This salt is enough to compute a
ticket for every possible common name (CN). A ticket, the master
node's certificate, and a self-signed certificate are enough to
successfully request the desired certificate from Icinga. That
certificate may in turn be used to steal an endpoint or API user's
identity. Versions 2.12.5 and 2.11.10 both contain a fix the
vulnerability. As a workaround, one may either specify queryable types
explicitly or filter out ApiListener objects.

Addressable is an alternative implementation to the URI implementation
that is part of Ruby's standard library. An uncontrolled resource
consumption vulnerability exists after version 2.3.0 through version
2.7.0. Within the URI template implementation in Addressable, a
maliciously crafted template may result in uncontrolled resource
consumption, leading to denial of service when matched against a URI.
In typical usage, templates would not normally be read from untrusted
user input, but nonetheless, no previous security advisory for
Addressable has cautioned against doing this. Users of the parsing
capabilities in Addressable but not the URI template capabilities are
unaffected. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.8.0. As a
workaround, only create Template objects from trusted sources that
have been validated not to produce catastrophic backtracking.

Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network
resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data
for reporting. In versions prior to 2.11.10 and from version 2.12.0
through version 2.12.4, some of the Icinga 2 features that require
credentials for external services expose those credentials through the
API to authenticated API users with read permissions for the
corresponding object types. IdoMysqlConnection and IdoPgsqlConnection
(every released version) exposes the password of the user used to
connect to the database. IcingaDB (added in 2.12.0) exposes the
password used to connect to the Redis server. ElasticsearchWriter
(added in 2.8.0)exposes the password used to connect to the
Elasticsearch server. An attacker who obtains these credentials can
impersonate Icinga to these services and add, modify and delete
information there. If credentials with more permissions are in use,
this increases the impact accordingly. Starting with the 2.11.10 and
2.12.5 releases, these passwords are no longer exposed via the API. As
a workaround, API user permissions can be restricted to not allow
querying of any affected objects, either by explicitly listing only
the required object types for object query permissions, or by applying
a filter rule.

Icinga Web 2 is an open source monitoring web interface, framework,
and command-line interface. A vulnerability in which custom variables
are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and
2.8.2. Custom variables are user-defined keys and values on
configuration objects in Icinga 2. These are commonly used to
reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be
able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2
displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said
hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible
to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a
user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of
the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom
variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom
variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented
URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga
Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list.
This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV.
Protection rules and blacklists however have no effect in this case.
Custom variables are shown as-is in the result. The issue has been
fixed in the 2.9.0, 2.8.3, and 2.7.5 releases. As a workaround, one
may set up a restriction to hide hosts and services with the custom
variable in question.

Nextcloud uses the WOPI ("Web Application Open Platform Interface")
protocol to communicate with the Collabora Editor, the communication
between these two services was not protected by a credentials or IP
check. Whilst this does not result in gaining access to data that the

fail2ban is a daemon to ban hosts that cause multiple authentication
errors. In versions 0.9.7 and prior, 0.10.0 through 0.10.6, and 0.11.0
through 0.11.2, there is a vulnerability that leads to possible remote
code execution in the mailing action mail-whois. Command `mail` from
mailutils package used in mail actions like `mail-whois` can execute
command if unescaped sequences (`\n~`) are available in "foreign"
input (for instance in whois output). To exploit the vulnerability, an
attacker would need to insert malicious characters into the response
sent by the whois server, either via a MITM attack or by taking over a
whois server. The issue is patched in versions 0.10.7 and 0.11.3. As a
workaround, one may avoid the usage of action `mail-whois` or patch
the vulnerability manually.

MuWire is a file publishing and networking tool that protects the
identity of its users by using I2P technology. Users of MuWire desktop
client prior to version 0.8.8 can be de-anonymized by an attacker who
knows their full ID. An attacker could send a message with a subject
line containing a URL with an HTML image tag and the MuWire client
would try to fetch that image via clearnet, thus exposing the IP
address of the user. The problem is fixed in MuWire 0.8.8. As a
workaround, users can disable messaging functionality to prevent other
users from sending them malicious messages.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation. In versions
prior to 7.2, start scripts generated by the `application` plugin and
the `gradlew` script are both vulnerable to arbitrary code execution
when an attacker is able to change environment variables for the user
running the script. This may impact those who use `gradlew` on Unix-
like systems or use the scripts generated by Gradle in thieir
application on Unix-like systems. For this vulnerability to be
exploitable, an attacker needs to be able to set the value of
particular environment variables and have those environment variables
be seen by the vulnerable scripts. This issue has been patched in
Gradle 7.2 by removing the use of `eval` and requiring the use of the
`bash` shell. There are a few workarounds available. For CI/CD systems
using the Gradle build tool, one may ensure that untrusted users are
unable to change environment variables for the user that executes
`gradlew`. If one is unable to upgrade to Gradle 7.2, one may generate
a new `gradlew` script with Gradle 7.2 and use it for older versions
of Gradle. Fpplications using start scripts generated by Gradle, one
may ensure that untrusted users are unable to change environment
variables for the user that executes the start script. A vulnerable
start script could be manually patched to remove the use of `eval` or
the use of environment variables that affect the application's
command-line. If the application is simple enough, one may be able to
avoid the use of the start scripts by running the application directly
with Java command.

EdgeX Foundry is an open source project for building a common open
framework for internet-of-things edge computing. A vulnerability
exists in the Edinburgh, Fuji, Geneva, and Hanoi versions of the
software. When the EdgeX API gateway is configured for OAuth2
authentication and a proxy user is created, the client_id and
client_secret required to obtain an OAuth2 authentication token are
set to the username of the proxy user. A remote network attacker can
then perform a dictionary-based password attack on the OAuth2 token
endpoint of the API gateway to obtain an OAuth2 authentication token
and use that token to make authenticated calls to EdgeX microservices
from an untrusted network. OAuth2 is the default authentication method
in EdgeX Edinburgh release. The default authentication method was
changed to JWT in Fuji and later releases. Users should upgrade to the
EdgeX Ireland release to obtain the fix. The OAuth2 authentication
method is disabled in Ireland release. If unable to upgrade and OAuth2
authentication is required, users should create OAuth2 users directly
using the Kong admin API and forgo the use of the `security-proxy-
setup` tool to create OAuth2 users.

containerd is a container runtime. A bug was found in containerd
versions prior to 1.4.8 and 1.5.4 where pulling and extracting a
specially-crafted container image can result in Unix file permission
changes for existing files in the host&#8217;s filesystem. Changes to file
permissions can deny access to the expected owner of the file, widen
access to others, or set extended bits like setuid, setgid, and
sticky. This bug does not directly allow files to be read, modified,
or executed without an additional cooperating process. This bug has
been fixed in containerd 1.5.4 and 1.4.8. As a workaround, ensure that
users only pull images from trusted sources. Linux security modules
(LSMs) like SELinux and AppArmor can limit the files potentially
affected by this bug through policies and profiles that prevent
containerd from interacting with specific files.

Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. A vulnerability
involving out-of-bounds read and integer overflow to buffer overflow
exists starting with version 2.2 and prior to versions 5.0.13, 6.0.15,
and 6.2.5. On 32-bit systems, Redis `*BIT*` command are vulnerable to
integer overflow that can potentially be exploited to corrupt the
heap, leak arbitrary heap contents or trigger remote code execution.
The vulnerability involves changing the default `proto-max-bulk-len`
configuration parameter to a very large value and constructing
specially crafted commands bit commands. This problem only affects
Redis on 32-bit platforms, or compiled as a 32-bit binary. Redis
versions 5.0.`3m 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 contain patches for this issue. An
additional workaround to mitigate the problem without patching the
`redis-server` executable is to prevent users from modifying the
`proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter. This can be done using
ACL to restrict unprivileged users from using the CONFIG SET command.

Redis is an open source, in-memory database that persists on disk. The
redis-cli command line tool and redis-sentinel service may be
vulnerable to integer overflow when parsing specially crafted large
multi-bulk network replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the
underlying hiredis library which does not perform an overflow check
before calling the calloc() heap allocation function. This issue only
impacts systems with heap allocators that do not perform their own
overflow checks. Most modern systems do and are therefore not likely
to be affected. Furthermore, by default redis-sentinel uses the
jemalloc allocator which is also not vulnerable. The problem is fixed
in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.

OpenProject has a `quote` method that implements the logic behind the
Quote button in the discussion forums, and it uses a regex to strip
`<pre>` tags from the message being quoted. The `(.|\s)` part can

Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. In
affected versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if
provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol
data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to
check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in
`SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make
this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent
buffer overflow. Users of hiredis who are unable to update may set the
[maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-
elements) context option to a value small enough that no overflow is
possible.

Text application returned different error messages depending on
whether a folder existed in a public link share. This is problematic
in case the public link share has been created with "Upload Only"
privileges. (aka "File Drop"). A link share recipient is not expected
to see which folders or files exist in a "File Drop" share. Using this
vulnerability an attacker is able to enumerate folders in such a

TYPO3 is an open source PHP based web content management system
released under the GNU GPL. In affected versions failing to properly
parse, sanitize and encode malicious rich-text content, the content
rendering process in the website frontend is vulnerable to cross-site
scripting. Corresponding rendering instructions via TypoScript
functionality HTMLparser does not consider all potentially malicious
HTML tag & attribute combinations per default. In default scenarios, a
valid backend user account is needed to exploit this vulnerability. In
case custom plugins used in the website frontend accept and reflect
rich-text content submitted by users, no authentication is required.
Update to TYPO3 versions 7.6.53 ELTS, 8.7.42 ELTS, 9.5.29, 10.4.19,
11.3.2 that fix the problem described.

Micronaut is a JVM-based, full stack Java framework designed for
building JVM applications. A path traversal vulnerability exists in
versions prior to 2.5.9. With a basic configuration, it is possible to
access any file from a filesystem, using "/../../" in the URL. This
occurs because Micronaut does not restrict file access to configured
paths. The vulnerability is patched in version 2.5.9. As a workaround,
do not use `**` in mapping, use only `*`, which exposes only flat
structure of a directory not allowing traversal. If using Linux,
another workaround is to run micronaut in chroot.

Gatsby is a framework for building websites. The gatsby-source-
wordpress plugin prior to versions 4.0.8 and 5.9.2 leaks .htaccess
HTTP Basic Authentication variables into the app.js bundle during
build-time. Users who are not initializing basic authentication

introduced in gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.8 and gatsby-source-
wordpress@5.9.2 which mitigates the issue by filtering all variables
specified in the `auth: { }` section. Users that depend on this
functionality are advised to upgrade to the latest release of gatsby-

Contiki-NG is an open-source, cross-platform operating system for IoT
devices. In affected versions it is possible to cause a buffer
overflow when copying an IPv6 address prefix in the RPL-Classic
implementation in Contiki-NG. In order to trigger the vulnerability,
the Contiki-NG system must have joined an RPL DODAG. After that, an
attacker can send a DAO packet with a Target option that contains a
prefix length larger than 128 bits. The problem was fixed after the
release of Contiki-NG 4.7. Users unable to upgrade may apply the patch
in Contiki-NG PR #1615.

Poddycast is a podcast app made with Electron. Prior to version 0.8.1,
an attacker can create a podcast or episode with malicious characters
and execute commands on the client machine. The application does not
clean the HTML characters of the podcast information obtained from the
Feed, which allows the injection of HTML and JS code (cross-site
scripting). Being an application made in electron, cross-site
scripting can be scaled to remote code execution, making it possible
to execute commands on the machine where the application is running.
The vulnerability is patched in Poddycast version 0.8.1.

Racket is a general-purpose programming language and an ecosystem for
language-oriented programming. In versions prior to 8.2, code
evaluated using the Racket sandbox could cause system modules to
incorrectly use attacker-created modules instead of their intended
dependencies. This could allow system functions to be controlled by
the attacker, giving access to facilities intended to be restricted.
This problem is fixed in Racket version 8.2. A workaround is
available, depending on system settings. For systems that provide
arbitrary Racket evaluation, external sandboxing such as containers
limit the impact of the problem. For multi-user evaluation systems,
such as the `handin-server` system, it is not possible to work around
this problem and upgrading is required.

Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for
large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions when
ext-authz extension is sending request headers to the external
authorization service it must merge multiple value headers according
to the HTTP spec. However, only the last header value is sent. This
may allow specifically crafted requests to bypass authorization.
Attackers may be able to escalate privileges when using ext-authz
extension or back end service that uses multiple value headers for
authorization. A specifically constructed request may be delivered by
an untrusted downstream peer in the presence of ext-authz extension.
Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, 1.16.5 contain fixes to the
ext-authz extension to correctly merge multiple request header values,

Envoy is an open source L7 proxy and communication bus designed for
large modern service oriented architectures. In affected versions
envoy incorrectly handled a URI '#fragment' element as part of the
path element. Envoy is configured with an RBAC filter for
authorization or similar mechanism with an explicit case of a final
"/admin" path element, or is using a negative assertion with final
path element of "/admin". The client sends request to
"/app1/admin#foo". In Envoy prior to 1.18.0, or 1.18.0+ configured
with path_normalization=false. Envoy treats fragment as a suffix of
the query string when present, or as a suffix of the path when query
string is absent, so it evaluates the final path element as
"/admin#foo" and mismatches with the configured "/admin" path element.
In Envoy 1.18.0+ configured with path_normalization=true. Envoy
transforms this to /app1/admin%23foo and mismatches with the
configured /admin prefix. The resulting URI is sent to the next
server-agent with the offending "#foo" fragment which violates RFC3986
or with the nonsensical "%23foo" text appended. A specifically
constructed request with URI containing '#fragment' element delivered
by an untrusted client in the presence of path based request
authorization resulting in escalation of Privileges when path based

Contour is a Kubernetes ingress controller using Envoy proxy. In
Contour before version 1.17.1 a specially crafted ExternalName type
Service may be used to access Envoy's admin interface, which Contour
normally prevents from access outside the Envoy container. This can be
used to shut down Envoy remotely (a denial of service), or to expose
the existence of any Secret that Envoy is using for its configuration,
including most notably TLS Keypairs. However, it *cannot* be used to
get the *content* of those secrets. Since this attack allows access to
the administration interface, a variety of administration options are
available, such as shutting down the Envoy or draining traffic. In
general, the Envoy admin interface cannot easily be used for making
changes to the cluster, in-flight requests, or backend services, but
it could be used to shut down or drain Envoy, change traffic routing,
or to retrieve secret metadata, as mentioned above. The issue will be
addressed in Contour v1.18.0 and a cherry-picked patch release,
v1.17.1, has been released to cover users who cannot upgrade at this
time. For more details refer to the linked GitHub Security Advisory.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00034.html

mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the
Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying
Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. When
mod_auth_openidc versions prior to 2.4.9 are configured to use an
unencrypted Redis cache (`OIDCCacheEncrypt off`, `OIDCSessionType
server-cache`, `OIDCCacheType redis`), `mod_auth_openidc` wrongly
performed argument interpolation before passing Redis requests to
`hiredis`, which would perform it again and lead to an uncontrolled
format string bug. Initial assessment shows that this bug does not
appear to allow gaining arbitrary code execution, but can reliably
provoke a denial of service by repeatedly crashing the Apache workers.
This bug has been corrected in version 2.4.9 by performing argument
interpolation only once, using the `hiredis` API. As a workaround,
this vulnerability can be mitigated by setting `OIDCCacheEncrypt` to
`on`, as cache keys are cryptographically hashed before use when this
option is enabled.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/04/msg00034.html

mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the
Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying
Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In
versions prior to 2.4.9, `oidc_validate_redirect_url()` does not parse
URLs the same way as most browsers do. As a result, this function can
be bypassed and leads to an Open Redirect vulnerability in the logout
functionality. This bug has been fixed in version 2.4.9 by replacing
any backslash of the URL to redirect with slashes to address a
particular breaking change between the different specifications
(RFC2396 / RFC3986 and WHATWG). As a workaround, this vulnerability
can be mitigated by configuring `mod_auth_openidc` to only allow
redirection whose destination matches a given regular expression.

Sourcegraph is a code search and navigation engine. Sourcegraph before
version 3.30.0 has two potential information leaks. The site-admin
area can be accessed by regular users and all information and features
are properly protected except for daily usage statistics and code
intelligence uploads and indexes. It is not possible to alter the
information, nor interact with any other features in the site-admin
area. The issue is patched in version 3.30.0, where the information
cannot be accessed by unprivileged users. There are no workarounds
aside from upgrading.

Discourse is an open source discussion platform. In versions prior to
2.7.7 there are two bugs which led to the post creator of a whisper
post being revealed to non-staff users. 1: Staff users that creates a
whisper post in a personal message is revealed to non-staff
participants of the personal message even though the whisper post
cannot be seen by them. 2: When a whisper post is before the last post
in a post stream, deleting the last post will result in the creator of
the whisper post to be revealed to non-staff users as the last poster
of the topic.

Woocommerce is an open source eCommerce plugin for WordPress. An SQL
injection vulnerability impacts all WooCommerce sites running the
WooCommerce plugin between version 3.3.0 and 3.3.6. Malicious actors
(already) having admin access, or API keys to the WooCommerce site can
exploit vulnerable endpoints of `/wp-json/wc/v3/webhooks`, `/wp-
json/wc/v2/webhooks` and other webhook listing API. Read-only SQL
queries can be executed using this exploit, while data will not be
returned, by carefully crafting `search` parameter information can be
disclosed using timing and related attacks. Version 3.3.6 is the
earliest version of Woocommerce with a patch for this vulnerability.
There are no known workarounds other than upgrading.

mod_auth_openidc is an authentication/authorization module for the
Apache 2.x HTTP server that functions as an OpenID Connect Relying
Party, authenticating users against an OpenID Connect Provider. In
mod_auth_openidc before version 2.4.9, the AES GCM encryption in
mod_auth_openidc uses a static IV and AAD. It is important to fix
because this creates a static nonce and since aes-gcm is a stream
cipher, this can lead to known cryptographic issues, since the same
key is being reused. From 2.4.9 onwards this has been patched to use
dynamic values through usage of cjose AES encryption routines.

Pi-hole's Web interface provides a central location to manage a Pi-
hole instance and review performance statistics. Prior to Pi-hole Web
interface version 5.5.1, the function to add domains to blocklists or
allowlists is vulnerable to a stored cross-site-scripting
vulnerability. User input added as a wildcard domain to a blocklist or
allowlist is unfiltered in the web interface. Since the payload is
stored permanently as a wildcard domain, this is a persistent XSS
vulnerability. A remote attacker can therefore attack administrative
user accounts through client-side attacks. Pi-hole Web Interface
version 5.5.1 contains a patch for this vulnerability.

ArchiSteamFarm is a C# application with primary purpose of idling
Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. Due to a bug in ASF
code `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global
ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from the resulting config
when the caller did not specify it explicitly. Due to the above, it
was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword`
security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF
config, which exists as part of global config update functionality in
ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as
unauthorized users may in result access the IPC interface after such
modification. The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future
versions. We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is
specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly. In default
settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` only
and should not affect majority of users.

ArchiSteamFarm is a C# application with primary purpose of idling
Steam cards from multiple accounts simultaneously. In versions prior
to 4.3.1.0 a Denial of Service (aka DoS) vulnerability which allows
attacker to remotely crash running ASF instance through sending a
specifically-crafted Steam chat message exists. The user sending the
message does not need to be authorized within the bot or ASF process.
The attacker needs to know ASF's `CommandPrefix` in advance, but
majority of ASF setups run with an unchanged default value. This
attack does not allow attacker to gain any potentially-sensitive
information, such as logins or passwords, does not allow to execute
arbitrary commands and otherwise exploit the crash further. The issue
is patched in ASF V4.3.1.0. The only workaround which guarantees
complete protection is running all bots with `OnlineStatus` of `0`
(Offline). In this setup, ASF is able to ignore even the specifically-
crafted message without attempting to interpret it.

Nextcloud server is an open source, self hosted personal cloud.
Nextcloud supports rendering image previews for user provided file
content. For some image types, the Nextcloud server was invoking a
third-party library that wasn't suited for untrusted user-supplied
content. There are several security concerns with passing user-
generated content to this library, such as Server-Side-Request-
Forgery, file disclosure or potentially executing code on the system.
The risk depends on your system configuration and the installed
library version. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is
upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0. These versions do not use this
library anymore. As a workaround users may disable previews by setting
`enable_previews` to `false` in `config.php`.

The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7,
4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite
vulnerability via insufficient symlink protection. `node-tar` aims to
guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic
link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that
extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to
prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is
a directory, paths are cached when directories are created. This logic
was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a
directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This
order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added
to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the
directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are
skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks
occur. By first creating a directory, and then replacing that
directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar`
symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar
file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting
arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file
creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3,
4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.

The npm package "tar" (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6,
4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite
vulnerability due to insufficient absolute path sanitization. node-tar
aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute
paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to
`true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any
absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example
`/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`. This logic
was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as
`////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path
root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating
path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would
still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file
creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2,
4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability
without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which
sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries
with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be
aware of CVE-2021-32803 which fixes a similar bug in later versions of
tar.

Flask-AppBuilder is an application development framework, built on top
of Flask. In affected versions if using Flask-AppBuilder OAuth, an
attacker can share a carefully crafted URL with a trusted domain for
an application built with Flask-AppBuilder, this URL can redirect a
user to a malicious site. This is an open redirect vulnerability. To
resolve this issue upgrade to Flask-AppBuilder 3.2.2 or above. If
upgrading is infeasible users may filter HTTP traffic containing
`?next={next-site}` where the `next-site` domain is different from the
application you are protecting as a workaround.

Products.isurlinportal is a replacement for isURLInPortal method in
Plone. Versions of Products.isurlinportal prior to 1.2.0 have an Open
Redirect vulnerability. Various parts of Plone use the 'is url in
portal' check for security, mostly to see if it is safe to redirect to
a url. A url like `https://example.org` is not in the portal. The url
`https:example.org` without slashes is considered to be in the portal.
When redirecting, some browsers go to `https://example.org`, others
give an error. Attackers may use this to redirect victims to their
site, especially as part of a phishing attack. The problem has been
patched in Products.isurlinportal 1.2.0.

The module `AccessControl` defines security policies for Python code
used in restricted code within Zope applications. Restricted code is
any code that resides in Zope's object database, such as the contents
of `Script (Python)` objects. The policies defined in `AccessControl`
severely restrict access to Python modules and only exempt a few that
are deemed safe, such as Python's `string` module. However, full
access to the `string` module also allows access to the class
`Formatter`, which can be overridden and extended within `Script
(Python)` in a way that provides access to other unsafe Python
libraries. Those unsafe Python libraries can be used for remote code
execution. By default, you need to have the admin-level Zope "Manager"
role to add or edit `Script (Python)` objects through the web. Only
sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the
web - which would be a very unusual configuration to begin with - are
at risk. The problem has been fixed in AccessControl 4.3 and 5.2. Only
AccessControl versions 4 and 5 are vulnerable, and only on Python 3,
not Python 2.7. As a workaround, a site administrator can restrict
adding/editing `Script (Python)` objects through the web using the
standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should
not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts
through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is
the default configuration in Zope.

crossbeam-deque is a package of work-stealing deques for building task
schedulers when programming in Rust. In versions prior to 0.7.4 and
0.8.0, the result of the race condition is that one or more tasks in
the worker queue can be popped twice instead of other tasks that are
forgotten and never popped. If tasks are allocated on the heap, this
can cause double free and a memory leak. If not, this still can cause
a logical bug. Crates using `Stealer::steal`, `Stealer::steal_batch`,
or `Stealer::steal_batch_and_pop` are affected by this issue. This has
been fixed in crossbeam-deque 0.8.1 and 0.7.4.

Zope is an open-source web application server. Zope versions prior to
versions 4.6.3 and 5.3 have a remote code execution security issue. In
order to be affected, one must use Python 3 for one's Zope deployment,
run Zope 4 below version 4.6.3 or Zope 5 below version 5.3, and have
the optional `Products.PythonScripts` add-on package installed. By
default, one must have the admin-level Zope "Manager" role to add or
edit Script (Python) objects through the web. Only sites that allow
untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web are at risk.
Zope releases 4.6.3 and 5.3 are not vulnerable. As a workaround, a
site administrator can restrict adding/editing Script (Python) objects
through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission
mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager
role and adding/editing these scripts through the web should be
restricted to trusted users only. This is the default configuration in
Zope.

2.90 and earlier, there is a reflected cross-site scripting
vulnerability in frontend HTTP server. The attacker can send in a
carefully crafted URL along with a known bug in the server which will
cause a 500 error, and the response will then embed the URL provided
by the hacker. The impact is moderate as the hacker must also be able
to craft an HTTP request which should cause a 500 server error. None
such requests are known as this point. The issue is patched in version
2.95. As a workaround, one may use a disk caching plugin.

Traefik is an HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer. Prior to version
2.4.13, there exists a potential header vulnerability in Traefik's
handling of the Connection header. Active exploitation of this issue
is unlikely, as it requires that a removed header would lead to a
privilege escalation, however, the Traefik team has addressed this
issue to prevent any potential abuse. If one has a chain of Traefik
middlewares, and one of them sets a request header, then sending a
request with a certain Connection header will cause it to be removed
before the request is sent. In this case, the backend does not see the
request header. A patch is available in version 2.4.13. There are no
known workarounds aside from upgrading.

frequently used Exiv2 operation than reading the metadata. For
example, to trigger the bug in the Exiv2 command-line application, you
need to add an extra command-line argument such as `fi`. ### Patches
The bug is fixed in version v0.27.5. ### References Regression test

Apache Dubbo is a java based, open source RPC framework. Versions
prior to 2.6.10 and 2.7.10 are vulnerable to pre-auth remote code
execution via arbitrary bean manipulation in the Telnet handler. The
Dubbo main service port can be used to access a Telnet Handler which
offers some basic methods to collect information about the providers
and methods exposed by the service and it can even allow to shutdown
the service. This endpoint is unprotected. Additionally, a provider
method can be invoked using the `invoke` handler. This handler uses a
safe version of FastJson to process the call arguments. However, the
resulting list is later processed with `PojoUtils.realize` which can
be used to instantiate arbitrary classes and invoke its setters. Even
though FastJson is properly protected with a default blocklist,
`PojoUtils.realize` is not, and an attacker can leverage that to
achieve remote code execution. Versions 2.6.10 and 2.7.10 contain
fixes for this issue.

MockServer is open source software which enables easy mocking of any
system you integrate with via HTTP or HTTPS. An attacker that can
trick a victim into visiting a malicious site while running MockServer
locally, will be able to run arbitrary code on the MockServer machine.
With an overly broad default CORS configuration MockServer allows any
site to send cross-site requests. Additionally, MockServer allows you
to create dynamic expectations using Javascript or Velocity templates.
Both engines may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on-behalf
of MockServer. By combining these two issues (Overly broad CORS
configuration + Script injection), an attacker could serve a malicious
page so that if a developer running MockServer visits it, they will
get compromised. For more details including a PoC see the referenced

ZStack is open source IaaS(infrastructure as a service) software
aiming to automate datacenters, managing resources of compute,
storage, and networking all by APIs. Affected versions of ZStack REST
API are vulnerable to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE)
via bypass of the Groovy shell sandbox. The REST API exposes the GET
zstack/v1/batch-queries?script endpoint which is backed up by the
BatchQueryAction class. Messages are represented by the
APIBatchQueryMsg, dispatched to the QueryFacadeImpl facade and handled
by the BatchQuery class. The HTTP request parameter script is mapped
to the APIBatchQueryMsg.script property and evaluated as a Groovy
script in BatchQuery.query the evaluation of the user-controlled
Groovy script is sandboxed by SandboxTransformer which will apply the
restrictions defined in the registered (sandbox.register())
GroovyInterceptor. Even though the sandbox heavily restricts the
receiver types to a small set of allowed types, the sandbox is non
effective at controlling any code placed in Java annotations and
therefore vulnerable to meta-programming escapes. This issue leads to
post-authenticated remote code execution. For more details see the

sqlparse is a non-validating SQL parser module for Python. In sqlparse
versions 0.4.0 and 0.4.1 there is a regular Expression Denial of
Service in sqlparse vulnerability. The regular expression may cause
exponential backtracking on strings containing many repetitions of
'\r\n' in SQL comments. Only the formatting feature that removes
comments from SQL statements is affected by this regular expression.
As a workaround don't use the sqlformat.format function with keyword
strip_comments=True or the --strip-comments command line flag when
using the sqlformat command line tool. The issues has been fixed in
sqlparse 0.4.2.

HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an
application. In versions 0.20210107 and prior of HyperKit, the
implementation of `qnotify` at `pci_vtrnd_notify` fails to check the
return value of `vq_getchain`. This leads to `struct iovec iov;` being
uninitialized and used to read memory in `len = (int)
read(sc->vrsc_fd, iov.iov_base, iov.iov_len);` when an attacker is
able to make `vq_getchain` fail. This issue may lead to a guest

HyperKit is a toolkit for embedding hypervisor capabilities in an
application. In versions 0.20210107, function `pci_vtsock_proc_tx` in
`virtio-sock` can lead to to uninitialized memory use. In this
situation, there is a check for the return value to be less or equal
to `VTSOCK_MAXSEGS`, but that check is not sufficient because the
function can return `-1` if it finds an error it cannot recover from.
Moreover, the negative return value will be used by `iovec_pull` in a
while condition that can further lead to more corruption because the
function is not designed to handle a negative `iov_len`. This issue
may lead to a guest crashing the host causing a denial of service and,
under certain circumstance, memory corruption. This issue is fixed in
commit af5eba2360a7351c08dfd9767d9be863a50ebaba.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20211007 CVE-2021-33035: Apache OpenOffice: Buffer overflow from a crafted DBF file
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/10/07/3

Apache OpenOffice opens dBase/DBF documents and shows the contents as
spreadsheets. DBF are database files with data organized in fields.
When reading DBF data the size of certain fields is not checked: the
data is just copied into local variables. A carefully crafted document
could overflow the allocated space, leading to the execution of
arbitrary code by altering the contents of the program stack. This
issue affects Apache OpenOffice up to and including version 4.1.10

Apache Tomcat 10.0.0-M1 to 10.0.6, 9.0.0.M1 to 9.0.46 and 8.5.0 to
8.5.66 did not correctly parse the HTTP transfer-encoding request
header in some circumstances leading to the possibility to request
smuggling when used with a reverse proxy. Specifically: - Tomcat
incorrectly ignored the transfer encoding header if the client
declared it would only accept an HTTP/1.0 response; - Tomcat honoured
the identify encoding; and - Tomcat did not ensure that, if present,
the chunked encoding was the final encoding.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/01/26/4

An issue was discovered in Xen 4.12.3 through 4.12.4 and 4.13.1
through 4.14.x. An x86 HVM guest with PCI pass through devices can
force the allocation of all IDT vectors on the system by rebooting
itself with MSI or MSI-X capabilities enabled and entries setup. Such
reboots will leak any vectors used by the MSI(-X) entries that the
guest might had enabled, and hence will lead to vector exhaustion on
the system, not allowing further PCI pass through devices to work
properly. HVM guests with PCI pass through devices can mount a Denial
of Service (DoS) attack affecting the pass through of PCI devices to
other guests or the hardware domain. In the latter case, this would
affect the entire host.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/06/08/4

In Apache APISIX Dashboard version 2.6, we changed the default value
of listen host to 0.0.0.0 in order to facilitate users to configure
external network access. In the IP allowed list restriction, a risky
function was used for the IP acquisition, which made it possible to
bypass the network limit. At the same time, the default account and
password are fixed.Ultimately these factors lead to the issue of
security risks. This issue is fixed in APISIX Dashboard 2.6.1

From Apache NiFi MiNiFi C++ version 0.5.0 the c2 protocol implements
an "agent-update" command which was designed to patch the application
binary. This "patching" command defaults to calling a trusted binary,
but might be modified to an arbitrary value through a "c2-update"
command. Said command is then executed using the same privileges as
the application binary. This was addressed in version 0.10.0

kernel/bpf/verifier.c in the Linux kernel through 5.12.7 enforces
incorrect limits for pointer arithmetic operations, aka CID-
bb01a1bba579. This can be abused to perform out-of-bounds reads and
writes in kernel memory, leading to local privilege escalation to
root. In particular, there is a corner case where the off reg causes a
masking direction change, which then results in an incorrect final
aux->alu_limit.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20210830 NTFS3G-SA-2021-0001: Multiple buffer overflows in all versions of NTFS-3G
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/08/30/1

In NTFS-3G versions < 2021.8.22, when a specially crafted NTFS
attribute is supplied to the function ntfs_get_attribute_value, a heap
buffer overflow can occur allowing for memory disclosure or denial of
service. The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bound buffer access
which can be triggered by mounting a crafted ntfs partition. The root
cause is a missing consistency check after reading an MFT record : the
"bytes_in_use" field should be less than the "bytes_allocated" field.
When it is not, the parsing of the records proceeds into the wild.
