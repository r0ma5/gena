Moonlight-common-c contains the core GameStream client code shared
between Moonlight clients. Moonlight-common-c is vulnerable to buffer
overflow starting in commit f57bd745b4cbed577ea654fad4701bea4d38b44c.
A malicious game streaming server could exploit a buffer overflow
vulnerability to crash a moonlight client. Achieving RCE is possible
but unlikely, due to stack canaries in use by modern compiler
toolchains. The published binaries for official clients Qt, Android,
iOS/tvOS, and Embedded are built with stack canaries, but some
unofficial clients may not use stack canaries. This vulnerability
takes place after the pairing process, so it requires the client to be
tricked into pairing to a malicious host. It is not possible to
perform using a man-in-the-middle due to public key pinning that takes
place during the pairing process. The bug was addressed in commit
b2497a3918a6d79808d9fd0c04734786e70d5954.

BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. BigBlueButton prior
to version 2.6.0-beta.1 has a path traversal vulnerability that allows
an attacker with a valid starting folder path, to traverse and read
other files without authentication, assuming the files have certain
extensions (txt, swf, svg, png). In version 2.6.0-beta.1, input
validation was added on the parameters being passed and dangerous
characters are stripped. There are no known workarounds.

Hydra is the layer-two scalability solution for Cardano. Prior to
version 0.13.0, not signing and verifying `$\mathsf{cid}$` allows an
attacker (which must be a participant of this head) to use a snapshot
from an old head instance with the same participants to close the head
or contest the state with it. This can lead to an incorrect
distribution of value (= value extraction attack; hard, but possible)
or prevent the head to finalize because the value available is not
consistent with the closed utxo state (= denial of service; easy). A
patch is planned for version 0.13.0. As a workaround, rotate keys
between heads so not to re-use keys and not result in the same multi-
signature participants.

Redisson is a Java Redis client that uses the Netty framework. Prior
to version 3.22.0, some of the messages received from the Redis server
contain Java objects that the client deserializes without further
validation. Attackers that manage to trick clients into communicating
with a malicious server can include especially crafted objects in its
responses that, once deserialized by the client, force it to execute
arbitrary code. This can be abused to take control of the machine the
client is running in. Version 3.22.0 contains a patch for this issue.
Some post-fix advice is available. Do NOT use `Kryo5Codec` as
deserialization codec, as it is still vulnerable to arbitrary object
deserialization due to the `setRegistrationRequired(false)` call. On
the contrary, `KryoCodec` is safe to use. The fix applied to
`SerializationCodec` only consists of adding an optional allowlist of
class names, even though making this behavior the default is
recommended. When instantiating `SerializationCodec` please use the
`SerializationCodec(ClassLoader classLoader, Set<String>
allowedClasses)` constructor to restrict the allowed classes for
deserialization.

aes-gcm is a pure Rust implementation of the AES-GCM. Starting in
version 0.10.0 and prior to version 0.10.3, in the AES GCM
implementation of decrypt_in_place_detached, the decrypted ciphertext
(i.e. the correct plaintext) is exposed even if tag verification
fails. If a program using the `aes-gcm` crate's `decrypt_in_place*`
APIs accesses the buffer after decryption failure, it will contain a
decryption of an unauthenticated input. Depending on the specific
nature of the program this may enable Chosen Ciphertext Attacks (CCAs)
which can cause a catastrophic breakage of the cipher including full
plaintext recovery. Version 0.10.3 contains a fix for this issue.

Kyverno is a policy engine designed for Kubernetes. A security
vulnerability was found in Kyverno where an attacker could cause
denial of service of Kyverno. The vulnerable component in Kyvernos
Notary verifier. An attacker would need control over the registry from
which Kyverno would fetch attestations. With such a position, the
attacker could return a malicious response to Kyverno, when Kyverno
would send a request to the registry. The malicious response would
cause denial of service of Kyverno, such that other users' admission
requests would be blocked from being processed. This is a
vulnerability in a new component released in v1.11.0. The only users
affected by this are those that have been building Kyverno from source

JumpServer is an open source bastion host. This vulnerability is due
to exposing the random number seed to the API, potentially allowing
the randomly generated verification codes to be replayed, which could
lead to password resets. If MFA is enabled users are not affect. Users
not using local authentication are also not affected. Users are
advised to upgrade to either version 2.28.19 or to 3.6.5. There are no
known workarounds or this issue.

The package `github.com/gomarkdown/markdown` is a Go library for
parsing Markdown text and rendering as HTML. Prior to pseudoversion
`0.0.0-20230922105210-14b16010c2ee`, which corresponds with commit
`14b16010c2ee7ff33a940a541d993bd043a88940`, parsing malformed markdown
input with parser that uses parser.Mmark extension could result in
out-of-bounds read vulnerability. To exploit the vulnerability, parser
needs to have `parser.Mmark` extension set. The panic occurs inside
the `citation.go` file on the line 69 when the parser tries to access
the element past its length. This can result in a denial of service.
Commit `14b16010c2ee7ff33a940a541d993bd043a88940`/pseudoversion
`0.0.0-20230922105210-14b16010c2ee` contains a patch for this issue.

xrdp is an open source remote desktop protocol server. Access to the
font glyphs in xrdp_painter.c is not bounds-checked . Since some of
this data is controllable by the user, this can result in an out-of-
bounds read within the xrdp executable. The vulnerability allows an
out-of-bounds read within a potentially privileged process. On non-
Debian platforms, xrdp tends to run as root. Potentially an out-of-
bounds write can follow the out-of-bounds read. There is no denial-of-
service impact, providing xrdp is running in forking mode. This issue
has been addressed in release 0.9.23.1. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20231123 CVE-2023-43123: Apache Storm: Local Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Storm-core on Unix-Like systems due temporary files
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/23/1

On unix-like systems, the temporary directory is shared between all
user. As such, writing to this directory using APIs that do not
explicitly set the file/directory permissions can lead to information
disclosure. Of note, this does not impact modern MacOS Operating
Systems. The method File.createTempFile on unix-like systems creates a
file with predefined name (so easily identifiable) and by default will
create this file with the permissions -rw-r--r--. Thus, if sensitive
information is written to this file, other local users can read this
information. File.createTempFile(String, String) will create a
temporary file in the system temporary directory if the
'java.io.tmpdir' system property is not explicitly set. This affects
the class https://github.com/apache/storm/blob/master/storm-
core/src/jvm/org/apache/storm/utils/TopologySpoutLag.java#L99 and was
introduced by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/STORM-3123 In
practice, this has a very limited impact as this class is used only if
ui.disable.spout.lag.monitoring is set to false, but its value is true
by default. Moreover, the temporary file gets deleted soon after its
creation. The solution is to use Files.createTempFile https://docs.ora
cle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/nio/file/Files.html#
createTempFile(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.nio.file.attribu
te.FileAttribute...) instead. We recommend that all users upgrade to
the latest version of Apache Storm.

The wpDataTables WordPress plugin before 2.1.66 does not validate the
"Serialized PHP array" input data before deserializing the data. This
allows admins to deserialize arbitrary data which may lead to remote
code execution if a suitable gadget chain is present on the server.
This is impactful in environments where admin users should not be
allowed to execute arbitrary code, such as multisite.

KNX devices that use KNX Connection Authorization and support Option 1
are, depending on the implementation, vulnerable to being locked and
users being unable to reset them to gain access to the device. The BCU
key feature on the devices can be used to create a password for the
device, but this password can often not be reset without entering the
current password. If the device is configured to interface with a
network, an attacker with access to that network could interface with
the KNX installation, purge all devices without additional security
options enabled, and set a BCU key, locking the device. Even if a
device is not connected to a network, an attacker with physical access
to the device could also exploit this vulnerability in the same way.

correctly. Also, the &#8220;vault&#8221; key is sealed/unsealed with SHA1 PCRs
instead of SHA256. This issue was somewhat mitigated due to all of the
PCR extend functions updating both the values of SHA256 and SHA1 for a
given PCR ID. However, due to the change that was implemented in
commit &#8220;7638364bc0acf8b5c481b5ce5fea11ad44ad7fd4&#8221;, this is no longer
the case for PCR14, as the code in &#8220;measurefs.go&#8221; explicitly updates
only the SHA256 instance of PCR14, which means that even if PCR14 were
to be added to the list of PCRs sealing/unsealing the &#8220;vault&#8221; key,
changes to the config partition would still not be measured. An
attacker could modify the config partition without triggering the
measured boot, this could result in the attacker gaining full control
over the device with full access to the contents of the encrypted
&#8220;vault&#8221;

As noted in the &#8220;VTPM.md&#8221; file in the eve documentation, &#8220;VTPM is a
server listening on port 8877 in EVE, exposing limited functionality
of the TPM to the clients. VTPM allows clients to execute tpm2-tools
binaries from a list of hardcoded options&#8221; The communication with this
server is done using protobuf, and the data is comprised of 2 parts:
1. Header 2. Data When a connection is made, the server is waiting for
4 bytes of data, which will be the header, and these 4 bytes would be
parsed as uint32 size of the actual data to come. Then, in the
function &#8220;handleRequest&#8221; this size is then used in order to allocate a
payload on the stack for the incoming data. As this payload is
allocated on the stack, this will allow overflowing the stack size
allocated for the relevant process with freely controlled data. * An

On boot, the Pillar eve container checks for the existence and content

When sealing/unsealing the &#8220;vault&#8221; key, a list of PCRs is used, which
defines which PCRs are used. In a previous project, CYMOTIVE found
that the configuration is not protected by the secure boot, and in
response Zededa implemented measurements on the config partition that
was mapped to PCR 13. In that process, PCR 13 was added to the list of
PCRs that seal/unseal the key. In commit
&#8220;56e589749c6ff58ded862d39535d43253b249acf&#8221;, the config partition
measurement moved from PCR 13 to PCR 14, but PCR 14 was not added to
the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the key. This change makes the
measurement of PCR 14 effectively redundant as it would not affect the
sealing/unsealing of the key. An attacker could modify the config
partition without triggering the measured boot, this could result in
the attacker gaining full control over the device with full access to
the contents of the encrypted &#8220;vault&#8221;

Vault Key Sealed With SHA1 PCRs The measured boot solution implemented
in EVE OS leans on a PCR locking mechanism. Different parts of the
system update different PCR values in the TPM, resulting in a unique
value for each PCR entry. These PCRs are then used in order to
seal/unseal a key from the TPM which is used to encrypt/decrypt the
&#8220;vault&#8221; directory. This &#8220;vault&#8221; directory is the most sensitive point
in the system and as such, its content should be protected. This
mechanism is noted in Zededa&#8217;s documentation as the &#8220;measured boot&#8221;
mechanism, designed to protect said &#8220;vault&#8221;. The code that&#8217;s
responsible for generating and fetching the key from the TPM assumes
that SHA256 PCRs are used in order to seal/unseal the key, and as such
their presence is being checked. The issue here is that the key is not
sealed using SHA256 PCRs, but using SHA1 PCRs. This leads to several
issues: &#8226; Machines that have their SHA256 PCRs enabled but SHA1 PCRs
disabled, as well as not sealing their keys at all, meaning the
&#8220;vault&#8221; is not protected from an attacker. &#8226; SHA1 is considered
insecure and reduces the complexity level required to unseal the key
in machines which have their SHA1 PCRs enabled. An attacker can very
easily retrieve the contents of the &#8220;vault&#8221;, which will effectively
render the &#8220;measured boot&#8221; mechanism meaningless.

In EVE OS, the &#8220;measured boot&#8221; mechanism prevents a compromised device
from accessing the encrypted data located in the vault. As per the
&#8220;measured boot&#8221; design, the PCR values calculated at different stages
of the boot process will change if any of their respective parts are
changed. This includes, among other things, the configuration of the
bios, grub, the kernel cmdline, initrd, and more. However, this
mechanism does not validate the entire rootfs, so an attacker can edit
the filesystem and gain control over the system. As the default
filesystem used by EVE OS is squashfs, this is somewhat harder than an
ext4, which is easily changeable. This will not stop an attacker, as
an attacker can repackage the squashfs with their changes in it and
replace the partition altogether. This can also be done directly on
the device, as the &#8220;003-storage-init&#8221; container contains the
&#8220;mksquashfs&#8221; and &#8220;unsquashfs&#8221; binaries (with the corresponding libs).
An attacker can gain full control over the device without changing the
PCR values, thus not triggering the &#8220;measured boot&#8221; mechanism, and

Due to the implementation of "deriveVaultKey", prior to version 7.10,
the generated vault key would always have the last 16 bytes
predetermined to be "arfoobarfoobarfo". This issue happens because
"deriveVaultKey" calls "retrieveCloudKey" (which will always return
"foobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfo" as the key), and then merges the
32byte randomly generated key with this key (by takeing 16bytes from
each, see "mergeKeys"). This makes the key a lot weaker. This issue
does not persist in devices that were initialized on/after version
7.10, but devices that were initialized before that and updated to a
newer version still have this issue. Roll an update that enforces the
full 32bytes key usage.

libcue provides an API for parsing and extracting data from CUE
sheets. Versions 2.2.1 and prior are vulnerable to out-of-bounds array
access. A user of the GNOME desktop environment can be exploited by
downloading a cue sheet from a malicious webpage. Because the file is
saved to `~/Downloads`, it is then automatically scanned by tracker-
miners. And because it has a .cue filename extension, tracker-miners
use libcue to parse the file. The file exploits the vulnerability in
libcue to gain code execution. This issue is patched in version 2.3.0.

JumpServer is an open source bastion host. The verification code for
resetting user's password is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to
the absence of rate limiting. JumpServer provides a feature allowing
users to reset forgotten passwords. Affected users are sent a 6-digit
verification code, ranging from 000000 to 999999, to facilitate the
password reset. Although the code is only available in 1 minute, this
window potentially allows for up to 1,000,000 validation attempts.
This issue has been addressed in versions 2.28.20 and 3.7.1. Users are
advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

JumpServer is an open source bastion host. An authenticated user can
exploit a vulnerability in MongoDB sessions to execute arbitrary
commands, leading to remote code execution. This vulnerability may
further be leveraged to gain root privileges on the system. Through
the WEB CLI interface provided by the koko component, a user logs into
the authorized mongoDB database and exploits the MongoDB session to
execute arbitrary commands. This vulnerability has been addressed in
versions 2.28.20 and 3.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/jumpserver/jumpserver/security/advisories/GHSA-fr8h-xh5x-r8g9

JumpServer is an open source bastion host. As an unauthenticated user,
it is possible to authenticate to the core API with a username and an
SSH public key without needing a password or the corresponding SSH
private key. An SSH public key should be considered public knowledge
and should not used as an authentication secret alone. JumpServer
provides an API for the KoKo component to validate user private key
logins. This API does not verify the source of requests and will
generate a personal authentication token. Given that public keys can
be easily leaked, an attacker can exploit the leaked public key and
username to authenticate, subsequently gaining access to the current
user's information and authorized actions. This issue has been
addressed in versions 2.28.20 and 3.7.1. Users are advised to upgrade.
There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

TorchServe is a tool for serving and scaling PyTorch models in
production. TorchServe default configuration lacks proper input
validation, enabling third parties to invoke remote HTTP download
requests and write files to the disk. This issue could be taken
advantage of to compromise the integrity of the system and sensitive
data. This issue is present in versions 0.1.0 to 0.8.1. A user is able
to load the model of their choice from any URL that they would like to
use. The user of TorchServe is responsible for configuring both the
allowed_urls and specifying the model URL to be used. A pull request
to warn the user when the default value for allowed_urls is used has
been merged in PR #2534. TorchServe release 0.8.2 includes this
change. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds
for this issue.

vulnerability. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade
should make sure `register_argc_argv` is disabled in php.ini, and
avoid publishing composer.phar to the web as this is not best

matrix-hookshot is a Matrix bot for connecting to external services
like GitHub, GitLab, JIRA, and more. Instances that have enabled
transformation functions (those that have
`generic.allowJsTransformationFunctions` in their config), may be
vulnerable to an attack where it is possible to break out of the `vm2`
sandbox and as a result Hookshot will be vulnerable to this. This
problem is only likely to affect users who have allowed untrusted
users to apply their own transformation functions. If you have only
enabled a limited set of trusted users, this threat is reduced (though
not eliminated). Version 4.5.0 and above of hookshot include a new
sandbox library which should better protect users. Users are advised
to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should disable
`generic.allowJsTransformationFunctions` in the config.

discourse-encrypt is a plugin that provides a secure communication
channel through Discourse. Improper escaping of encrypted topic titles
could lead to a cross site scripting (XSS) issue when a site has
content security policy (CSP) headers disabled. Having CSP disabled is
a non-default configuration, and having it disabled with discourse-
encrypt installed will result in a warning in the Discourse admin
dashboard. This has been fixed in commit `9c75810af9` which is
included in the latest version of the discourse-encrypt plugin. Users
are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should ensure that CSP
headers are enabled and properly configured.

Warpgate is a smart SSH, HTTPS and MySQL bastion host for Linux that
doesn't need special client apps. The SSH key verification for a user
can be bypassed by sending an SSH key offer without a signature. This

ShokoServer is a media server which specializes in organizing anime.
In affected versions the `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint is accessible
without authentication and is supposed to return default server
images. The endpoint accepts the parameter `serverImagePath`, which is
not sanitized in any way before being passed to
`System.IO.File.OpenRead`, which results in an arbitrary file read.
This issue may lead to an arbitrary file read which is exacerbated in
the windows installer which installs the ShokoServer as administrator.
Any unauthenticated attacker may be able to access sensitive
information and read files stored on the server. The
`/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint has been removed in commit `6c57ba0f0`
which will be included in subsequent releases. Users should limit
access to the `/api/Image/WithPath` endpoint or manually patch their
installations until a patched release is made. This issue was
discovered by the GitHub Security lab and is also indexed as
GHSL-2023-191.

The LiteSpeed Cache plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
Cross-Site Scripting via the 'esi' shortcode in versions up to, and
including, 5.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
escaping on user supplied attributes. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers with contributor-level and above permissions
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a
user accesses an injected page.

and 16.04 patch 16109 allows an unauthenticated attacker to obtain an
administrative session via a protection mechanism failure in the
authentication function. In normal operation, the Zultys MX
Administrator Windows client connects to port 7505 and attempts
authentication, submitting the administrator username and password to
the server. Upon authentication failure, the server sends a login
failure message prompting the client to disconnect. However, if the
client ignores the failure message instead and attempts to continue,
the server does not forcibly close the connection and processes all
subsequent requests from the client as if authentication had been
successful.

Nocodb is an open source Airtable alternative. Affected versions of
nocodb contain a SQL injection vulnerability, that allows an
authenticated attacker with creator access to query the underlying
database. By supplying a specially crafted payload to the given an
attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries to be executed. Since this
is a blind SQL injection, an attacker may need to use time-based
payloads which would include a function to delay execution for a given
number of seconds. The response time indicates, whether the result of
the query execution was true or false. Depending on the result, the
HTTP response will be returned after a given number of seconds,
indicating TRUE, or immediately, indicating FALSE. In that way, an
attacker can reveal the data present in the database. This
vulnerability has been addressed in version 0.111.0. Users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

BigBlueButton is an open-source virtual classroom. BigBlueButton prior
to versions 2.6.12 and 2.7.0-rc.1 is vulnerable to Server-Side Request
Forgery (SSRF). This issue is a bypass of CVE-2023-33176. A patch in
versions 2.6.12 and 2.7.0-rc.1 disabled follow redirect at
`httpclient.execute` since the software no longer has to follow it
when using `finalUrl`. There are no known workarounds. We recommend
upgrading to a patched version of BigBlueButton.

urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. urllib3
doesn't treat the `Cookie` HTTP header special or provide any helpers
for managing cookies over HTTP, that is the responsibility of the
user. However, it is possible for a user to specify a `Cookie` header
and unknowingly leak information via HTTP redirects to a different
origin if that user doesn't disable redirects explicitly. This issue
has been patched in urllib3 version 1.26.17 or 2.0.5.

Soft Serve is a self-hostable Git server for the command line. Prior
to version 0.6.2, a security vulnerability in Soft Serve could allow
an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass public key
authentication when keyboard-interactive SSH authentication is active,
through the `allow-keyless` setting, and the public key requires
additional client-side verification for example using FIDO2 or GPG.
This is due to insufficient validation procedures of the public key
step during SSH request handshake, granting unauthorized access if the
keyboard-interaction mode is utilized. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by presenting manipulated SSH requests using keyboard-
interactive authentication mode. This could potentially result in
unauthorized access to the Soft Serve. Users should upgrade to the
latest Soft Serve version `v0.6.2` to receive the patch for this
issue. To workaround this vulnerability without upgrading, users can
temporarily disable Keyboard-Interactive SSH Authentication using the
`allow-keyless` setting.

OpenTelemetry, also known as OTel for short, is a vendor-neutral open-
source Observability framework for instrumenting, generating,
collecting, and exporting telemetry data such as traces, metrics,
logs. Autoinstrumentation out of the box adds the label `http_method`
that has unbound cardinality. It leads to the server's potential
memory exhaustion when many malicious requests are sent. HTTP method
for requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long.
In order to be affected program has to be instrumented for HTTP
handlers and does not filter any unknown HTTP methods on the level of
CDN, LB, previous middleware, etc. This issue has been patched in
version 0.41b0.

Name: CVE-2023-44121
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://lgsecurity.lge.com/bulletins/mobile#updateDetails

The vulnerability is an intent redirection in LG ThinQ Service
("com.lge.lms2") in the
"com/lge/lms/things/ui/notification/NotificationManager.java" file.
This vulnerability could be exploited by a third-party app installed
on an LG device by sending a broadcast with the action
"com.lge.lms.things.notification.ACTION". Additionally, this
vulnerability is very dangerous because LG ThinQ Service is a system
app (having android:sharedUserId="android.uid.system" setting). Intent
redirection in this app leads to accessing arbitrary not exported
activities of absolutely all apps.

Name: CVE-2023-44122
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://lgsecurity.lge.com/bulletins/mobile#updateDetails

The vulnerability is to theft of arbitrary files with system privilege
in the LockScreenSettings ("com.lge.lockscreensettings") app in the "c
om/lge/lockscreensettings/dynamicwallpaper/MyCategoryGuideActivity.jav
a" file. The main problem is that the app launches implicit intents
that can be intercepted by third-party apps installed on the same
device. They also can return arbitrary data that will be passed to the
"onActivityResult()" method. The LockScreenSettings app copies the
received file to the "/data/shared/dw/mycategory/wallpaper_01.png"
path and then changes the file access mode to world-readable and
world-writable.

The vulnerability is the use of implicit PendingIntents with the
PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE set that leads to theft and/or (over-)write
of arbitrary files with system privilege in the Bluetooth

to app notifications, could intercept them and redirect them to its
activity, before making it grant access permissions to content
providers with the `android:grantUriPermissions="true"` flag.

The vulnerability is to theft of arbitrary files with system privilege
in the Screen recording ("com.lge.gametools.gamerecorder") app in the 
"com/lge/gametools/gamerecorder/settings/ProfilePreferenceFragment.jav
a" file. The main problem is that the app launches implicit intents
that can be intercepted by third-party apps installed on the same
device. They also can return arbitrary data that will be passed to the
"onActivityResult()" method. The Screen recording app saves contents
of arbitrary URIs to SD card which is a world-readable storage.

The vulnerability is that the Call management
("com.android.server.telecom") app patched by LG sends a lot of LG-
owned implicit broadcasts that disclose sensitive data to all third-
party apps installed on the same device. Those intents include data
such as call states, durations, called numbers, contacts info, etc.

Reference: URL:https://lgsecurity.lge.com/bulletins/mobile#updateDetails

he vulnerability is to delete arbitrary files in LGInstallService
("com.lge.lginstallservies") app. The app contains the exported
"com.lge.lginstallservies.InstallService" service that exposes an AIDL
interface. All its "installPackage*" methods are finally calling the
"installPackageVerify()" method that performs signature validation
after the delete file method. An attacker can control conditions so
this security check is never performed and an attacker-controlled file
is deleted.

Name: CVE-2023-44129
Status: Candidate
Reference: MISC:https://lgsecurity.lge.com/bulletins/mobile#updateDetails
Reference: URL:https://lgsecurity.lge.com/bulletins/mobile#updateDetails

The vulnerability is that the Messaging ("com.android.mms") app
patched by LG forwards attacker-controlled intents back to the
attacker in the exported
"com.android.mms.ui.QClipIntentReceiverActivity" activity. The
attacker can abuse this functionality by launching this activity and
then sending a broadcast with the "com.lge.message.action.QCLIP"
action. The attacker can send, e.g., their own data/clipdata and set
Intent.FLAG_GRANT_* flags. After the attacker received that intent in
the "onActivityResult()" method, they would have access to arbitrary
content providers that have the `android:grantUriPermissions="true"`
flag set.

A Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition vulnerability in
telemetry processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows a network-
based authenticated attacker to flood the system with multiple
telemetry requests, causing the Junos Kernel Debugging Streaming
Daemon (jkdsd) process to crash, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
Continued receipt and processing of telemetry requests will repeatedly
crash the jkdsd process and sustain the Denial of Service (DoS)
condition. This issue is seen on all Junos platforms. The crash is
triggered when multiple telemetry requests come from different
collectors. As the load increases, the Dynamic Rendering Daemon
(drend) decides to defer processing and continue later, which results
in a timing issue accessing stale memory, causing the jkdsd process to
crash and restart. Note: jkdsd is not shipped with SRX Series devices
and therefore are not affected by this vulnerability. This issue

An Origin Validation vulnerability in MAC address validation of
Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved on PTX10001, PTX10004, PTX10008, and
PTX10016 devices allows a network-adjacent attacker to bypass MAC
address checking, allowing MAC addresses not intended to reach the
adjacent LAN to be forwarded to the downstream network. Due to this
issue, the router will start forwarding traffic if a valid route is
present in forwarding-table, causing a loop and congestion in the
downstream layer-2 domain connected to the device. This issue affects

An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding
Engine of Juniper Networks Junos OS allows an unauthenticated,
network-based attacker to cause memory leak, leading to Denial of
Service (DoS). On all Junos OS QFX5000 Series platforms, when pseudo-
VTEP (Virtual Tunnel End Point) is configured under EVPN-VXLAN
scenario, and specific DHCP packets are transmitted, DMA memory leak
is observed. Continuous receipt of these specific DHCP packets will
cause memory leak to reach 99% and then cause the protocols to stop
working and traffic is impacted, leading to Denial of Service (DoS)
condition. A manual reboot of the system recovers from the memory
leak. To confirm the memory leak, monitor for "sheaf:possible leak"
and "vtep not found" messages in the logs. This issue affects: Juniper

The NSS code used for checking PKCS#1 v1.5 was leaking information
useful in mounting Bleichenbacher-like attacks. Both the overall
correctness of the padding as well as the length of the encrypted
message was leaking through timing side-channel. By sending large
number of attacker-selected ciphertexts, the attacker would be able to
decrypt a previously intercepted PKCS#1 v1.5 ciphertext (for example,
to decrypt a TLS session that used RSA key exchange), or forge a
signature using the victim's key. The issue was fixed by implementing
the implicit rejection algorithm, in which the NSS returns a
deterministic random message in case invalid padding is detected, as
proposed in the Marvin Attack paper. This vulnerability affects NSS <

gnark is a zk-SNARK library that offers a high-level API to design
circuits. Prior to version 0.9.0, for some in-circuit values, it is
possible to construct two valid decomposition to bits. In addition to
the canonical decomposition of `a`, for small values there exists a
second decomposition for `a+r` (where `r` is the modulus the values
are being reduced by). The second decomposition was possible due to
overflowing the field where the values are defined. Upgrading to
version 0.9.0 should fix the issue without needing to change the calls
to value comparison methods.

Gradle is a build tool with a focus on build automation and support
for multi-language development. When copying or archiving symlinked
files, Gradle resolves them but applies the permissions of the symlink
itself instead of the permissions of the linked file to the resulting
file. This leads to files having too much permissions given that
symlinks usually are world readable and writeable. While it is
unlikely this results in a direct vulnerability for the impacted
build, it may open up attack vectors depending on where build
artifacts end up being copied to or un-archived. In versions 7.6.3,
8.4 and above, Gradle will now properly use the permissions of the
file pointed at by the symlink to set permissions of the copied or
archived file.

HtmlSanitizer is a .NET library for cleaning HTML fragments and
documents from constructs that can lead to XSS attacks. The
vulnerability occurs in configurations where foreign content is
allowed, i.e. either `svg` or `math` are in the list of allowed
elements. In the case an application sanitizes user input with a
vulnerable configuration, an attacker could bypass the sanitization
and inject arbitrary HTML, including JavaScript code. Note that in the
default configuration the vulnerability is not present. The
vulnerability has been fixed in versions 8.0.723 and 8.1.722-beta

Garden provides automation for Kubernetes development and testing.
Prior tov ersions 0.13.17 and 0.12.65, Garden has a dependency on the
cryo library, which is vulnerable to code injection due to an insecure
implementation of deserialization. Garden stores serialized objects
using cryo in the Kubernetes `ConfigMap` resources prefixed with
`test-result` and `run-result` to cache Garden test and run results.
These `ConfigMaps` are stored either in the `garden-system` namespace
or the configured user namespace. When a user invokes the command
`garden test` or `garden run` objects stored in the `ConfigMap` are
retrieved and deserialized. This can be used by an attacker with
access to the Kubernetes cluster to store malicious objects in the
`ConfigMap`, which can trigger a remote code execution on the users
machine when cryo deserializes the object. In order to exploit this
vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the Kubernetes cluster
used to deploy garden remote environments. Further, a user must
actively invoke either a `garden test` or `garden run` which has
previously cached results. The issue has been patched in Garden
versions `0.13.17` (Bonsai) and `0.12.65` (Acorn). Only Garden
versions prior to these are vulnerable. No known workarounds are
available.

Piwigo is an open source photo gallery application. Prior to version
14.0.0beta4, a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability is
in the`
/admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]`
page. This vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker to inject
malicious HTML and JS code into the HTML page, which could then be
executed by admin users when they visit the URL with the payload. The
vulnerability is caused by the insecure injection of the `plugin_id`
value from the URL into the HTML page. An attacker can exploit this
vulnerability by crafting a malicious URL that contains a specially
crafted `plugin_id` value. When a victim who is logged in as an
administrator visits this URL, the malicious code will be injected
into the HTML page and executed. This vulnerability can be exploited
by any attacker who has access to a malicious URL. However, only users
who are logged in as administrators are affected. This is because the
vulnerability is only present on the
`/admin.php?page=plugins&tab=new&installstatus=ok&plugin_id=[here]`
page, which is only accessible to administrators. Version 14.0.0.beta4
contains a patch for this issue.

Exiv2 is a C++ library and a command-line utility to read, write,
delete and modify Exif, IPTC, XMP and ICC image metadata. An out-of-
bounds write was found in Exiv2 version v0.28.0. The vulnerable
function, `BmffImage::brotliUncompress`, is new in v0.28.0, so earlier
versions of Exiv2 are _not_ affected. The out-of-bounds write is
triggered when Exiv2 is used to read the metadata of a crafted image
file. An attacker could potentially exploit the vulnerability to gain
code execution, if they can trick the victim into running Exiv2 on a
crafted image file. This bug is fixed in version v0.28.1. Users are
advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.

ZITADEL provides identity infrastructure. In versions 2.37.2 and
prior, ZITADEL administrators can enable a setting called "Ignoring
unknown usernames" which helps mitigate attacks that try to
guess/enumerate usernames. While this settings was properly working
during the authentication process it did not work correctly on the
password reset flow. This meant that even if this feature was active
that an attacker could use the password reset function to verify if an
account exist within ZITADEL. This bug has been patched in versions
2.37.3 and 2.38.0. No known workarounds are available.

Reference: URL:https://www.silverstripe.org/download/security-releases/CVE-2023-44401

The Silverstripe CMS GraphQL Server serves Silverstripe data as
GraphQL representations. In versions 4.0.0 prior to 4.3.7 and 5.0.0
prior to 5.1.3, `canView` permission checks are bypassed for ORM data
in paginated GraphQL query results where the total number of records
is greater than the number of records per page. Note that this also
affects GraphQL queries which have a limit applied, even if the query
isn&#8217;t paginated per se. This has been fixed in versions 4.3.7 and
5.1.3 by ensuring no new records are pulled in from the database after
performing `canView` permission checks for each page of results. This
may result in some pages in the query results having less than the
maximum number of records per page even when there are more pages of
results. This behavior is consistent with how pagination works in
other areas of Silverstripe CMS, such as in `GridField`, and is a
result of having to perform permission checks in PHP rather than in
the database directly. One may disable these permission checks by
disabling the `CanViewPermission` plugin.

Electron is an open source framework for writing cross-platform
desktop applications using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This only impacts
apps that have the `embeddedAsarIntegrityValidation` and
`onlyLoadAppFromAsar` fuses enabled. Apps without these fuses enabled
are not impacted. This issue is specific to macOS as these fuses are
only currently supported on macOS. Specifically this issue can only be
exploited if your app is launched from a filesystem the attacker has
write access too. i.e. the ability to edit files inside the `.app`
bundle on macOS which these fuses are supposed to protect against.
There are no app side workarounds, you must update to a patched
version of Electron.

An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol
Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows
an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of
Service (DoS). When certain specific crafted BGP UPDATE messages are
received over an established BGP session, one BGP session may be torn
down with an UPDATE message error, or the issue may propagate beyond
the local system which will remain non-impacted, but may affect one or
more remote systems. This issue is exploitable remotely as the crafted
UPDATE message can propagate through unaffected systems and
intermediate BGP speakers. Continuous receipt of the crafted BGP
UPDATE messages will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS)
condition for impacted devices. This issue affects eBGP and iBGP, in
both IPv4 and IPv6 implementations. This issue requires a remote
attacker to have at least one established BGP session.

untrusted input to affect Gif_Realloc calls, might allow a denial of

parties because the Gifsicle code is not commonly used for unattended
operation in which new input arrives for a long-running process, does
not ship with functionality to link it into another application as a

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/10/11/4

Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key vulnerability in
Apache ZooKeeper. If SASL Quorum Peer authentication is enabled in
ZooKeeper (quorum.auth.enableSasl=true), the authorization is done by
verifying that the instance part in SASL authentication ID is listed
in zoo.cfg server list. The instance part in SASL auth ID is optional
and if it's missing, like 'eve@EXAMPLE.COM', the authorization check
will be skipped. As a result an arbitrary endpoint could join the
cluster and begin propagating counterfeit changes to the leader,
essentially giving it complete read-write access to the data tree.
Quorum Peer authentication is not enabled by default. Users are
recommended to upgrade to version 3.9.1, 3.8.3, 3.7.2, which fixes the
issue. Alternately ensure the ensemble election/quorum communication
is protected by a firewall as this will mitigate the issue. See the
documentation for more details on correct cluster administration.

The Order Tracking Pro plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
Cross-Site Scripting via the order status parameter in versions up to,
and including, 3.3.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers (admin or
higher) to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they
can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as
clicking on a link. This only affects multi-site installations and
installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

Reference: URL:https://portal.microfocus.com/s/article/KM000021287

User authentication with username and password credentials is
ineffective in OpenText (Micro Focus) Visual COBOL, COBOL Server,
Enterprise Developer, and Enterprise Server (including product
variants such as Enterprise Test Server), versions 7.0 patch updates
19 and 20, 8.0 patch updates 8 and 9, and 9.0 patch update 1, when
LDAP-based authentication is used with certain configurations. When
the vulnerability is active, authentication succeeds with any valid
username, regardless of whether the password is correct; it may also
succeed with an invalid username (and any password). This allows an
attacker with access to the product to impersonate any user.
Mitigations: The issue is corrected in the upcoming patch update for
each affected product. Product overlays and workaround instructions
are available through OpenText Support. The vulnerable configurations
are believed to be uncommon. Administrators can test for the
vulnerability in their installations by attempting to sign on to a
Visual COBOL or Enterprise Server component such as ESCWA using a
valid username and incorrect password.

Fiber is an express inspired web framework written in Go. A Cross-Site
Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the
application, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary values and
forge malicious requests on behalf of a user. This vulnerability can
allow an attacker to inject arbitrary values without any
authentication, or perform various malicious actions on behalf of an
authenticated user, potentially compromising the security and
integrity of the application. The vulnerability is caused by improper
validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within the application. This
issue has been addressed in version 2.50.0 and users are advised to
upgrade. Users should take additional security measures like captchas
or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and set Session cookies with
SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure, and the Secure and HttpOnly
attributes as defense in depth measures. There are no known
workarounds for this vulnerability.

Synapse is an open-source Matrix homeserver written and maintained by
the Matrix.org Foundation. Prior to version 1.94.0, a malicious server
ACL event can impact performance temporarily or permanently leading to
a persistent denial of service. Homeservers running on a closed
federation (which presumably do not need to use server ACLs) are not
affected. Server administrators are advised to upgrade to Synapse
1.94.0 or later. As a workaround, rooms with malicious server ACL
events can be purged and blocked using the admin API.

software uses `storage::remove_prefix` (now renamed to
`storage::clear_prefix`) to remove all storages associated with it.
This is a single IO primitive call passing the WebAssembly boundary.
For large contracts, the call (without providing a `limit` parameter)
can be slow. In addition, for parachains, all storages to be deleted
will be part of the PoV, which easily exceed relay chain PoV size
limit. On the other hand, Frontier's maintainers only charge a fixed
cost for opcode SUICIDE. The maintainers consider the severity of this
issue high, because an attacker can craft a contract with a lot of
storage values on a parachain, and then call opcode SUICIDE on the
contract. If the transaction makes into a parachain block, the
parachain will then stall because the PoV size will exceed relay
chain's limit. This is especially an issue for XCM transactions,
because they can't be skipped. Commit
aea528198b3b226e0d20cce878551fd4c0e3d5d0 contains a patch for this
issue. For parachains, it's recommended to issue an emergency runtime
upgrade as soon as possible. For standalone chains, the impact is less
severe because the issue mainly affects PoV sizes. It's recommended to
issue a normal runtime upgrade as soon as possible. There are no known
workarounds.

NAXSI is an open-source maintenance web application firewall (WAF) for
NGINX. An issue present starting in version 1.3 and prior to version
1.6 allows someone to bypass the WAF when a malicious `X-Forwarded-
For` IP matches `IgnoreIP` `IgnoreCIDR` rules. This old code was
arranged to allow older NGINX versions to also support `IgnoreIP`
`IgnoreCIDR` when multiple reverse proxies were present. The issue is
patched in version 1.6. As a workaround, do not set any `IgnoreIP`
`IgnoreCIDR` for older versions.

Babel is a compiler for writingJavaScript. In `@babel/traverse` prior
to versions 7.23.2 and 8.0.0-alpha.4 and all versions of `babel-
traverse`, using Babel to compile code that was specifically crafted
by an attacker can lead to arbitrary code execution during
compilation, when using plugins that rely on the `path.evaluate()`or
`path.evaluateTruthy()` internal Babel methods. Known affected plugins
are `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`; `@babel/preset-env` when using
its `useBuiltIns` option; and any "polyfill provider" plugin that
depends on `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider`, such as `babel-
plugin-polyfill-corejs3`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs2`, `babel-
plugin-polyfill-es-shims`, `babel-plugin-polyfill-regenerator`. No
other plugins under the `@babel/` namespace are impacted, but third-
party plugins might be. Users that only compile trusted code are not
impacted. The vulnerability has been fixed in `@babel/traverse@7.23.2`
and `@babel/traverse@8.0.0-alpha.4`. Those who cannot upgrade
`@babel/traverse` and are using one of the affected packages mentioned
above should upgrade them to their latest version to avoid triggering
the vulnerable code path in affected `@babel/traverse` versions:
`@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` v7.23.2, `@babel/preset-env`
v7.23.2, `@babel/helper-define-polyfill-provider` v0.4.3, `babel-
plugin-polyfill-corejs2` v0.4.6, `babel-plugin-polyfill-corejs3`
v0.8.5, `babel-plugin-polyfill-es-shims` v0.10.0, `babel-plugin-
polyfill-regenerator` v0.5.3.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-
platform-web` starting in version 3.1-milestone-1 and prior to
13.4-rc-1, `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` prior to
versions 14.10.2 and 15.5-rc-1, and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-web-
standard` starting in version 2.4-milestone-2 and prior to version
3.1-milestone-1 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. An attacker
can create a template provider on any document that is part of the
wiki (could be the attacker's user profile) that contains malicious
code. This code is executed when this template provider is selected
during document creation which can be triggered by sending the user to
a URL. For the attacker, the only requirement is to have an account as
by default the own user profile is editable. This allows an attacker
to execute arbitrary actions with the rights of the user opening the
malicious link. Depending on the rights of the user, this may allow
remote code execution and full read and write access to the whole
XWiki installation. This has been patched in
`org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` 13.4-rc-1,
`org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` 14.10.2 and
15.5-rc-1, and `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-web-standard` 3.1-milestone-1
by adding the appropriate escaping. The vulnerable template file
createinline.vm is part of XWiki's WAR and can be patched by manually
applying the changes from the fix.

XWiki Platform is a generic wiki platform offering runtime services
for applications built on top of it. In `org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-
platform-web` versions 7.2-milestone-2 until 14.10.12 and
`org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` prior to versions
14.10.12 and 15.5-rc-1, it is possible to pass a title to the page
creation action that isn't displayed at first but then executed in the
second step. This can be used by an attacker to trick a victim to
execute code, allowing script execution if the victim has script right
or remote code execution including full access to the XWiki instance
if the victim has programming right. For the attack to work, the
attacker needs to convince the victim to visit a link like `<xwiki-hos
t>/xwiki/bin/create/NonExistingSpace/WebHome?title=$services.logging.g
etLogger(%22foo%22).error(%22Script%20executed!%22)` where `<xwiki-
host>` is the URL of the Wiki installation and to then click on the
"Create" button on that page. The page looks like a regular XWiki page
that the victim would also see when clicking the button to create a
page that doesn't exist yet, the malicious code is not displayed
anywhere on that page. After clicking the "Create" button, the
malicious title would be displayed but at this point, the code has
already been executed and the attacker could use this code also to
hide the attack, e.g., by redirecting the victim again to the same
page with an innocent title. It thus seems plausible that this attack
could work if the attacker can place a fake "create page" button on a
page which is possible with edit right. This has been patched in
`org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web` version 14.10.12 and
`org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-web-templates` versions 14.10.12
and 15.5-rc-1 by displaying the title already in the first step such
that the victim can notice the attack before continuing. It is
possible to manually patch the modified files from the patch in an
existing installation. For the JavaScript change, the minified
JavaScript file would need to be obtained from a build of XWiki and
replaced accordingly.

the existing document so this requires that the attacker first creates
a non-empty document whose name contains the attack code. This has

Change Request is an pplication allowing users to request changes on a
wiki without publishing the changes directly. Starting in version 0.11
and prior to version 1.9.2, it's possible for a user without any
specific right to perform script injection and remote code execution
just by inserting an appropriate title when creating a new Change
Request. This vulnerability is particularly critical as Change Request
aims at being created by user without any particular rights. The
vulnerability has been fixed in Change Request 1.9.2. It's possible to
workaround the issue without upgrading by editing the document
`ChangeRequest.Code.ChangeRequestSheet` and by performing the same
change as in the fix commit.

Fiber is an express inspired web framework written in Go. A Cross-Site
Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability has been identified in the
application, which allows an attacker to obtain tokens and forge
malicious requests on behalf of a user. This can lead to unauthorized
actions being taken on the user's behalf, potentially compromising the
security and integrity of the application. The vulnerability is caused
by improper validation and enforcement of CSRF tokens within the
application. This vulnerability has been addressed in version 2.50.0
and users are advised to upgrade. Users should take additional
security measures like captchas or Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and
set Session cookies with SameSite=Lax or SameSite=Secure, and the
Secure and HttpOnly attributes.

OpenTelemetry-Go Contrib is a collection of third-party packages for
OpenTelemetry-Go. A handler wrapper out of the box adds labels
`http.user_agent` and `http.method` that have unbound cardinality. It
leads to the server's potential memory exhaustion when many malicious
requests are sent to it. HTTP header User-Agent or HTTP method for
requests can be easily set by an attacker to be random and long. The
library internally uses `httpconv.ServerRequest` that records every
value for HTTP `method` and `User-Agent`. In order to be affected, a
program has to use the `otelhttp.NewHandler` wrapper and not filter
any unknown HTTP methods or User agents on the level of CDN, LB,
previous middleware, etc. Version 0.44.0 fixed this issue when the
values collected for attribute `http.request.method` were changed to
be restricted to a set of well-known values and other high cardinality
attributes were removed. As a workaround to stop being affected,
`otelhttp.WithFilter()` can be used, but it requires manual careful
configuration to not log certain requests entirely. For convenience
and safe usage of this library, it should by default mark with the
label `unknown` non-standard HTTP methods and User agents to show that
such requests were made but do not increase cardinality. In case
someone wants to stay with the current behavior, library API should
allow to enable it.

Undici is an HTTP/1.1 client written from scratch for Node.js. Prior
to version 5.26.2, Undici already cleared Authorization headers on
cross-origin redirects, but did not clear `Cookie` headers. By design,
`cookie` headers are forbidden request headers, disallowing them to be
set in RequestInit.headers in browser environments. Since undici
handles headers more liberally than the spec, there was a disconnect
from the assumptions the spec made, and undici's implementation of
fetch. As such this may lead to accidental leakage of cookie to a
third-party site or a malicious attacker who can control the
redirection target (ie. an open redirector) to leak the cookie to the
third party site. This was patched in version 5.26.2. There are no
known workarounds.

com.xwiki.identity-oauth:identity-oauth-ui is a package to aid in
building identity and service providers based on OAuth authorizations.
When a user logs in via the OAuth method, the identityOAuth parameters
sent in the GET request is vulnerable to cross site scripting (XSS)
and XWiki syntax injection. This allows remote code execution via the
groovy macro and thus affects the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of the whole XWiki installation. The issue has been fixed
in Identity OAuth version 1.6. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability and users are advised to upgrade.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/10/msg00032.html

Redis is an in-memory database that persists on disk. On startup,
Redis begins listening on a Unix socket before adjusting its
permissions to the user-provided configuration. If a permissive
umask(2) is used, this creates a race condition that enables, during a
short period of time, another process to establish an otherwise
unauthorized connection. This problem has existed since Redis
2.6.0-RC1. This issue has been addressed in Redis versions 7.2.2,
7.0.14 and 6.2.14. Users are advised to upgrade. For users unable to
upgrade, it is possible to work around the problem by disabling Unix
sockets, starting Redis with a restrictive umask, or storing the Unix
socket file in a protected directory.

XXL-RPC is a high performance, distributed RPC framework. With it, a
TCP server can be set up using the Netty framework and the Hessian
serialization mechanism. When such a configuration is used, attackers
may be able to connect to the server and provide malicious serialized
objects that, once deserialized, force it to execute arbitrary code.
This can be abused to take control of the machine the server is
running by way of remote code execution. This issue has not been

Discourse. Users are advised to update to version 3.1.1 if they are on
the stable branch or 3.2.0.beta2 if they are on the beta branch. Users
unable to upgrade should disable any plugins that access topic custom
fields.

The filepath package does not recognize paths with a \??\ prefix as
special. On Windows, a path beginning with \??\ is a Root Local Device
path equivalent to a path beginning with \\?\. Paths with a \??\
prefix may be used to access arbitrary locations on the system. For
example, the path \??\c:\x is equivalent to the more common path c:\x.
Before fix, Clean could convert a rooted path such as \a\..\??\b into
the root local device path \??\b. Clean will now convert this to
.\??\b. Similarly, Join(\, ??, b) could convert a seemingly innocent
sequence of path elements into the root local device path \??\b. Join
will now convert this to \.\??\b. In addition, with fix, IsAbs now
correctly reports paths beginning with \??\ as absolute, and
VolumeName correctly reports the \??\ prefix as a volume name. UPDATE:
Go 1.20.11 and Go 1.21.4 inadvertently changed the definition of the
volume name in Windows paths starting with \?, resulting in
filepath.Clean(\?\c:) returning \?\c: rather than \?\c:\ (among other
effects). The previous behavior has been restored.

A race condition in go-resty can result in HTTP request body
disclosure across requests. This condition can be triggered by calling
sync.Pool.Put with the same *bytes.Buffer more than once, when request
retries are enabled and a retry occurs. The call to sync.Pool.Get will
then return a bytes.Buffer that hasn't had bytes.Buffer.Reset called
on it. This dirty buffer will contain the HTTP request body from an
unrelated request, and go-resty will append the current HTTP request
body to it, sending two bodies in one request. The sync.Pool in
question is defined at package level scope, so a completely unrelated
server could receive the request body.

Before Go 1.20, the RSA based TLS key exchanges used the math/big
library, which is not constant time. RSA blinding was applied to
prevent timing attacks, but analysis shows this may not have been
fully effective. In particular it appears as if the removal of PKCS#1
padding may leak timing information, which in turn could be used to
recover session key bits. In Go 1.20, the crypto/tls library switched
to a fully constant time RSA implementation, which we do not believe
exhibits any timing side channels.

stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images.
A crafted image file may trigger out of bounds memcpy read in
`stbi__gif_load_next`. This happens because two_back points to a
memory address lower than the start of the buffer out. This issue may
be used to leak internal memory allocation information.

When `stbi_set_flip_vertically_on_load` is set to `TRUE` and
`req_comp` is set to a number that doesn&#8217;t match the real number of

stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images.
The stbi__getn function reads a specified number of bytes from context
(typically a file) into the specified buffer. In case the file stream
points to the end, it returns zero. There are two places where its
return value is not checked: In the `stbi__hdr_load` function and in
the `stbi__tga_load` function. The latter of the two is likely more
exploitable as an attacker may also control the size of an
uninitialized buffer.

stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images.
A crafted image file can trigger `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem`

`stbi__load_gif_main` because when the `layers * stride` value is zero
the behavior is implementation defined, but common that realloc frees
the old memory and returns null pointer. Since it attempts to double-
free the memory a few lines below the first &#8220;free&#8221;, the issue can be
potentially exploited only in a multi-threaded environment. In the
worst case this may lead to code execution.

stb_image is a single file MIT licensed library for processing images.
It may look like `stbi__load_gif_main` doesn&#8217;t give guarantees about
the content of output value `*delays` upon failure. Although it sets
`*delays` to zero at the beginning, it doesn&#8217;t do it in case the image
is not recognized as GIF and a call to `stbi__load_gif_main_outofmem`
only frees possibly allocated memory in `*delays` without resetting it
to zero. Thus it would be fair to say the caller of
`stbi__load_gif_main` is responsible to free the allocated memory in
`*delays` only if `stbi__load_gif_main` returns a non null value.
However at the same time the function may return null value, but fail
to free the memory in `*delays` if internally `stbi__convert_format`
is called and fails. Thus the issue may lead to a memory leak if the
caller chooses to free `delays` only when `stbi__load_gif_main` didn&#8217;t
fail or to a double-free if the `delays` is always freed

If `stbi__load_gif_main` in `stbi_load_gif_from_memory` fails it
returns a null pointer and may keep the `z` variable uninitialized. In
case the caller also sets the flip vertically flag, it continues and
calls `stbi__vertical_flip_slices` with the null pointer result value
and the uninitialized `z` value. This may result in a program crash.

WebAuthn4J Spring Security provides Web Authentication specification
support for Spring applications. Affected versions are subject to
improper signature counter value handling. A flaw was found in
webauthn4j-spring-security-core. When an authneticator returns an
incremented signature counter value during authentication,
webauthn4j-spring-security-core does not properly persist the value,
which means cloned authenticator detection does not work. An attacker
who cloned valid authenticator in some way can use the cloned
authenticator without being detected. This issue has been addressed in
version `0.9.1.RELEASE`. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no
known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version
0.13.0 Beta 3, the `config/save` and `config/set` endpoints of Frigate
do not implement any CSRF protection. This makes it possible for a
request sourced from another site to update the configuration of the
Frigate server (e.g. via "drive-by" attack). Exploiting this
vulnerability requires the attacker to both know very specific
information about a user's Frigate server and requires an
authenticated user to be tricked into clicking a specially crafted
link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability could exploited by
an attacker under the following circumstances: Frigate publicly
exposed to the internet (even with authentication); attacker knows the
address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker crafts a specialized
page which links to the user's Frigate instance; attacker finds a way
to get an authenticated user to visit their specialized page and click
the button/link. This issue can lead to arbitrary configuration
updates for the Frigate server, resulting in denial of service and
possible data exfiltration. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a patch.

Frigate is an open source network video recorder. Prior to version
0.13.0 Beta 3, an unsafe deserialization vulnerability was identified
in the endpoints used to save configurations for Frigate. This can
lead to unauthenticated remote code execution. This can be performed
through the UI at `/config` or through a direct call to
`/api/config/save`. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the
attacker to both know very specific information about a user's Frigate
server and requires an authenticated user to be tricked into clicking
a specially crafted link to their Frigate instance. This vulnerability
could exploited by an attacker under the following circumstances:
Frigate publicly exposed to the internet (even with authentication);
attacker knows the address of a user's Frigate instance; attacker
crafts a specialized page which links to the user's Frigate instance;
attacker finds a way to get an authenticated user to visit their
specialized page and click the button/link. Input is initially
accepted through `http.py`. The user-provided input is then parsed and
loaded by `load_config_with_no_duplicates`. However,
`load_config_with_no_duplicates` does not sanitize this input by merit
of using `yaml.loader.Loader` which can instantiate custom
constructors. A provided payload will be executed directly at
`frigate/util/builtin.py:110`. This issue may lead to pre-
authenticated Remote Code Execution. Version 0.13.0 Beta 3 contains a
patch.

stb_vorbis is a single file MIT licensed library for processing ogg
vorbis files. A crafted file may trigger out of bounds write in
`f->vendor[len] = (char)'\0';`. The root cause is that if the len read
in `start_decoder` is `-1` and `len + 1` becomes 0 when passed to
`setup_malloc`. The `setup_malloc` behaves differently when
`f->alloc.alloc_buffer` is pre-allocated. Instead of returning `NULL`
as in `malloc` case it shifts the pre-allocated buffer by zero and
returns the currently available memory block. This issue may lead to
code execution.
