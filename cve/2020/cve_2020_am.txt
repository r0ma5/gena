ntpkeygen can generate keys that ntpd fails to parse. NTPsec 1.2.0
allows ntpkeygen to generate keys with '#' characters. ntpd then
either pads, shortens the key, or fails to load these keys entirely,
depending on the key type and the placement of the '#'. This results
in the administrator not being able to use the keys as expected or the
keys are shorter than expected and easier to brute-force, possibly
resulting in MITM attacks between ntp clients and ntp servers. For
short AES128 keys, ntpd generates a warning that it is padding them.

A privilege escalation vulnerability impacting the Google Exposure
Notification Verification Server (versions prior to 0.23.1), allows an
attacker who (1) has UserWrite permissions and (2) is using a
carefully crafted request or malicious proxy, to create another user
with higher privileges than their own. This occurs due to insufficient
checks on the allowed set of permissions. The new user creation event
would be captured in the Event Log.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20220112 Re: CVE-2021-22569: Protobuf Java, Kotlin, JRuby DoS
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2022/01/12/7

An issue in protobuf-java allowed the interleaving of
com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet fields in such a way that would be
processed out of order. A small malicious payload can occupy the
parser for several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived
objects that cause frequent, repeated pauses. We recommend upgrading
libraries beyond the vulnerable versions.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/04/02/2

CXF supports (via JwtRequestCodeFilter) passing OAuth 2 parameters via
a JWT token as opposed to query parameters (see: The OAuth 2.0
Authorization Framework: JWT Secured Authorization Request (JAR)).
Instead of sending a JWT token as a "request" parameter, the spec also
supports specifying a URI from which to retrieve a JWT token from via
the "request_uri" parameter. CXF was not validating the "request_uri"
parameter (apart from ensuring it uses "https) and was making a REST
request to the parameter in the request to retrieve a token. This
means that CXF was vulnerable to DDos attacks on the authorization
server, as specified in section 10.4.1 of the spec. This issue affects
Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.3; Apache CXF versions prior to
3.3.10.

An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub
Enterprise Server that allowed authenticated users of the instance to
gain write access to unauthorized repositories via specifically
crafted pull requests and REST API requests. An attacker would need to
be able to fork the targeted repository, a setting that is disabled by
default for organization owned private repositories. Branch
protections such as required pull request reviews or status checks
would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged without further
review or validation. This vulnerability affected all versions of
GitHub Enterprise Server since 2.4.21 and was fixed in versions
2.20.24, 2.21.15, 2.22.7 and 3.0.1. This vulnerability was reported
via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.

An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub
Enterprise Server that allowed an authenticated user with the ability
to fork a repository to disclose Actions secrets for the parent
repository of the fork. This vulnerability existed due to a flaw that
allowed the base reference of a pull request to be updated to point to
an arbitrary SHA or another pull request outside of the fork
repository. By establishing this incorrect reference in a PR, the
restrictions that limit the Actions secrets sent a workflow from forks
could be bypassed. This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise
Server version 3.0.0, 3.0.0.rc2, and 3.0.0.rc1. This vulnerability was
reported via the GitHub Bug Bounty program.

An improper access control vulnerability was identified in the GitHub
Enterprise Server GraphQL API that allowed authenticated users of the
instance to modify the maintainer collaboration permission of a pull
request without proper authorization. By exploiting this
vulnerability, an attacker would be able to gain access to head
branches of pull requests opened on repositories of which they are a
maintainer. Forking is disabled by default for organization owned
private repositories and would prevent this vulnerability.
Additionally, branch protections such as required pull request reviews
or status checks would prevent unauthorized commits from being merged
without further review or validation. This vulnerability affected all
versions of GitHub Enterprise Server since 2.12.22 and was fixed in
versions 2.20.24, 2.21.15, 2.22.7 and 3.0.1. This vulnerability was

An improper access control vulnerability was identified in GitHub
Enterprise Server that allowed access tokens generated from a GitHub
App's web authentication flow to read private repository metadata via
the REST API without having been granted the appropriate permissions.
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to create a
GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize the application
through the web authentication flow. The private repository metadata
returned would be limited to repositories owned by the user the token
identifies. This vulnerability affected all versions of GitHub

A UI misrepresentation vulnerability was identified in GitHub
Enterprise Server that allowed more permissions to be granted during a
GitHub App's user-authorization web flow than was displayed to the
user during approval. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would
need to create a GitHub App on the instance and have a user authorize
the application through the web authentication flow. All permissions
being granted would properly be shown during the first authorization,
but in certain circumstances, if the user revisits the authorization
flow after the GitHub App has configured additional user-level
permissions, those additional permissions may not be shown, leading to
more permissions being granted than the user potentially intended.
This vulnerability affected GitHub Enterprise Server 3.0.x prior to
3.0.7 and 2.22.x prior to 2.22.13. It was fixed in versions 3.0.7 and

groups within the organization because of improper authentication
checks during the request. This could cause code to be run
unintentionally by the incorrect runner group. This vulnerability
affected GitHub Enterprise Server versions from 3.0.0 to 3.0.15 and

Revive Adserver before 5.1.0 permits any user with a manager account
to store possibly malicious content in the URL website property, which
is then displayed unsanitized in the affiliate-preview.php tag
generation screen, leading to a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS)
vulnerability.

Revive Adserver before 5.1.0 is vulnerable to a reflected cross-site
scripting (XSS) vulnerability via the publicly accessible afr.php
delivery script. While this issue was previously addressed in modern
browsers as CVE-2020-8115, some older browsers (e.g., IE10) that do
not automatically URL encode parameters were still vulnerable.

Revive Adserver before 5.1.0 is vulnerable to open redirects via the
`dest`, `oadest`, and/or `ct0` parameters of the lg.php and ck.php
delivery scripts. Such open redirects had previously been available by
design to allow third party ad servers to track such metrics when
delivering ads. However, third party click tracking via redirects is
not a viable option anymore, leading to such open redirect
functionality being removed and reclassified as a vulnerability.

Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to
a denial of service attack when too many connection attempts with an
'unknownProtocol' are established. This leads to a leak of file
descriptors. If a file descriptor limit is configured on the system,
then the server is unable to accept new connections and prevent the
process also from opening, e.g. a file. If no file descriptor limit is
configured, then this lead to an excessive memory usage and cause the
system to run out of memory.

Node.js before 10.24.0, 12.21.0, 14.16.0, and 15.10.0 is vulnerable to
DNS rebinding attacks as the whitelist includes &#8220;localhost6&#8221;. When
&#8220;localhost6&#8221; is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary
domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker
controls the victim's DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS
rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the &#8220;localhost6&#8221; domain.
As long as the attacker uses the &#8220;localhost6&#8221; domain, they can still
apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160.

curl 7.63.0 to and including 7.75.0 includes vulnerability that allows
a malicious HTTPS proxy to MITM a connection due to bad handling of
TLS 1.3 session tickets. When using a HTTPS proxy and TLS 1.3, libcurl
can confuse session tickets arriving from the HTTPS proxy but work as
if they arrived from the remote server and then wrongly "short-cut"
the host handshake. When confusing the tickets, a HTTPS proxy can
trick libcurl to use the wrong session ticket resume for the host and
thereby circumvent the server TLS certificate check and make a MITM
attack to be possible to perform unnoticed. Note that such a malicious
HTTPS proxy needs to provide a certificate that curl will accept for
the MITMed server for an attack to work - unless curl has been told to
ignore the server certificate check.

curl 7.61.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from exposure of data element to
wrong session due to a mistake in the code for CURLOPT_SSL_CIPHER_LIST
when libcurl is built to use the Schannel TLS library. The selected
cipher set was stored in a single "static" variable in the library,
which has the surprising side-effect that if an application sets up
multiple concurrent transfers, the last one that sets the ciphers will
accidentally control the set used by all transfers. In a worst-case
scenario, this weakens transport security significantly.

curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability
resulting in already freed memory being used when a TLS 1.3 session
ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server can use this in
rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code
execution in the client. When libcurl at run-time sets up support for
TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it stores
pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a
session ticket arrives. If the connection is used by multiple
transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed
HTTP/2 connection) that first transfer object might be freed before
the new session is established on that connection and then the
function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using
that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object,
making it possible for a remote code execution if the server could
somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct place in
memory.

The actionpack ruby gem before 6.1.3.2 suffers from a possible open

with certain "allowed host" formats can cause the Host Authorization
middleware in Action Pack to redirect users to a malicious website.
This is similar to CVE-2021-22881. Strings in config.hosts that do not
have a leading dot are converted to regular expressions without proper
escaping. This causes, for example, `config.hosts <<
"sub.example.com"` to permit a request with a Host header value of

When curl is instructed to download content using the metalink
feature, thecontents is verified against a hash provided in the
metalink XML file.The metalink XML file points out to the client how
to get the same contentfrom a set of different URLs, potentially
hosted by different servers and theclient can then download the file
from one or several of them. In a serial orparallel manner.If one of
the servers hosting the contents has been breached and the contentsof
the specific file on that server is replaced with a modified payload,
curlshould detect this when the hash of the file mismatches after a
completeddownload. It should remove the contents and instead try
getting the contentsfrom another URL. This is not done, and instead
such a hash mismatch is onlymentioned in text and the potentially
malicious content is kept in the file ondisk.

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for
subsequenttransfers to reuse, if one of them matches the setup.Due to
errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take
'issuercert' into account and it compared the involved paths *case
insensitively*,which could lead to libcurl reusing wrong
connections.File paths are, or can be, case sensitive on many systems
but not all, and caneven vary depending on used file systems.The
comparison also didn't include the 'issuer cert' which a transfer can
setto qualify how to verify the server certificate.

curl supports the `-t` command line option, known as
`CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS`in libcurl. This rarely used option is used to
send variable=content pairs toTELNET servers.Due to flaw in the option
parser for sending `NEW_ENV` variables, libcurlcould be made to pass
on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to theserver.
Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to
theserver using a clear-text network protocol.This could happen
because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly whenparsing the
string provided by the application.

libcurl-using applications can ask for a specific client certificate
to be used in a transfer. This is done with the `CURLOPT_SSLCERT`
option (`--cert` with the command line tool).When libcurl is built to
use the macOS native TLS library Secure Transport, an application can
ask for the client certificate by name or with a file name - using the
same option. If the name exists as a file, it will be used instead of
by name.If the appliction runs with a current working directory that
is writable by other users (like `/tmp`), a malicious user can create
a file name with the same name as the app wants to use by name, and
thereby trick the application to use the file based cert instead of
the one referred to by name making libcurl send the wrong client
certificate in the TLS connection handshake.

requirement could be bypassed if the server would return a properly
crafted but perfectly legitimate response.This flaw would then make
curl silently continue its operations **withoutTLS** contrary to the
instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in
clear text over the network.

When curl >= 7.20.0 and <= 7.78.0 connects to an IMAP or POP3 server
to retrieve data using STARTTLS to upgrade to TLS security, the server
can respond and send back multiple responses at once that curl caches.
curl would then upgrade to TLS but not flush the in-queue of cached
responses but instead continue using and trustingthe responses it got
*before* the TLS handshake as if they were authenticated.Using this
flaw, it allows a Man-In-The-Middle attacker to first inject the fake
responses, then pass-through the TLS traffic from the legitimate
server and trick curl into sending data back to the user thinking the
attacker's injected data comes from the TLS-protected server.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/05/10/4

A race condition in Linux kernel SCTP sockets (net/sctp/socket.c)
before 5.12-rc8 can lead to kernel privilege escalation from the
context of a network service or an unprivileged process. If
sctp_destroy_sock is called without sock_net(sk)->sctp.addr_wq_lock
then an element is removed from the auto_asconf_splist list without
any proper locking. This can be exploited by an attacker with network
service privileges to escalate to root or from the context of an
unprivileged user directly if a BPF_CGROUP_INET_SOCK_CREATE is
attached which denies creation of some SCTP socket.

Opera Mini for Android below 53.1 displays URL left-aligned in the
address field. This allows a malicious attacker to craft a URL with a
long domain name, e.g. www.safe.opera.com.attacker.com. With the URL
being left-aligned, the user will only see the front part (e.g.
www.safe.opera.com&#8230;) The exact amount depends on the phone screen size
but the attacker can craft a number of different domains and target
different phones. Starting with version 53.1 Opera Mini displays long
URLs with the top-level domain label aligned to the right of the
address field which mitigates the issue.

The package python/cpython from 0 and before 3.6.13, from 3.7.0 and
before 3.7.10, from 3.8.0 and before 3.8.8, from 3.9.0 and before
3.9.2 are vulnerable to Web Cache Poisoning via urllib.parse.parse_qsl
and urllib.parse.parse_qs by using a vector called parameter cloaking.
When the attacker can separate query parameters using a semicolon (;),
they can cause a difference in the interpretation of the request
between the proxy (running with default configuration) and the server.
This can result in malicious requests being cached as completely safe
ones, as the proxy would usually not see the semicolon as a separator,
and therefore would not include it in a cache key of an unkeyed
parameter.

The package github.com/pires/go-proxyproto before 0.5.0 are vulnerable
to Denial of Service (DoS) via the parseVersion1() function. The
reader in this package is a default bufio.Reader wrapping a net.Conn.
It will read from the connection until it finds a newline. Since no
limits are implemented in the code, a deliberately malformed V1 header
could be used to exhaust memory in a server process using this code -
and create a DoS. This can be exploited by sending a stream starting
with PROXY and continuing to send data (which does not contain a
newline) until the target stops acknowledging. The risk here is small,
because only trusted sources should be allowed to send proxy protocol
headers.

This affects the package clearance before 2.5.0. The vulnerability can
be possible when users are able to set the value of
session[:return_to]. If the value used for return_to contains multiple
leading slashes (/////example.com) the user ends up being redirected
to the external domain that comes after the slashes
(http://example.com).

This affects the package immer before 9.0.6. A type confusion
vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2020-28477 when the user-
provided keys used in the path parameter are arrays. In particular,
this bypass is possible because the condition (p === "__proto__" || p
=== "constructor") in applyPatches_ returns false if p is
['__proto__'] (or ['constructor']). The === operator (strict equality
operator) returns false if the operands have different type.

This affects the package mpath before 0.8.4. A type confusion
vulnerability can lead to a bypass of CVE-2018-16490. In particular,
the condition ignoreProperties.indexOf(parts[i]) !== -1 returns -1 if

All versions of package git are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution
(RCE) due to missing sanitization in the Git.git method, which allows
execution of OS commands rather than just git commands. Steps to
Reproduce 1. Create a file named exploit.js with the following
content: js var Git = require("git").Git; var repo = new Git("repo-
test"); var user_input = "version; date"; repo.git(user_input,
function(err, result) { console.log(result); }) 2. In the same
directory as exploit.js, run npm install git. 3. Run exploit.js: node
exploit.js. You should see the outputs of both the git version and
date command-lines. Note that the repo-test Git repository does not
need to be present to make this PoC work.

This affects the package celery before 5.2.2. It by default trusts the
messages and metadata stored in backends (result stores). When reading
task metadata from the backend, the data is deserialized. Given that
an attacker can gain access to, or somehow manipulate the metadata
within a celery backend, they could trigger a stored command injection
vulnerability and potentially gain further access to the system.

OpenSSL 1.0.2 supports SSLv2. If a client attempts to negotiate SSLv2
with a server that is configured to support both SSLv2 and more recent
SSL and TLS versions then a check is made for a version rollback
attack when unpadding an RSA signature. Clients that support SSL or
TLS versions greater than SSLv2 are supposed to use a special form of
padding. A server that supports greater than SSLv2 is supposed to
reject connection attempts from a client where this special form of
padding is present, because this indicates that a version rollback has
occurred (i.e. both client and server support greater than SSLv2, and
yet this is the version that is being requested). The implementation
of this padding check inverted the logic so that the connection
attempt is accepted if the padding is present, and rejected if it is
absent. This means that such as server will accept a connection if a
version rollback attack has occurred. Further the server will
erroneously reject a connection if a normal SSLv2 connection attempt
is made. Only OpenSSL 1.0.2 servers from version 1.0.2s to 1.0.2x are
affected by this issue. In order to be vulnerable a 1.0.2 server must:
1) have configured SSLv2 support at compile time (this is off by
default), 2) have configured SSLv2 support at runtime (this is off by
default), 3) have configured SSLv2 ciphersuites (these are not in the
default ciphersuite list) OpenSSL 1.1.1 does not have SSLv2 support
and therefore is not vulnerable to this issue. The underlying error is
in the implementation of the RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function. This
also affects the RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode used by various other
functions. Although 1.1.1 does not support SSLv2 the
RSA_padding_check_SSLv23() function still exists, as does the
RSA_SSLV23_PADDING padding mode. Applications that directly call that
function or use that padding mode will encounter this issue. However
since there is no support for the SSLv2 protocol in 1.1.1 this is
considered a bug and not a security issue in that version. OpenSSL
1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public updates.
Premium support customers of OpenSSL 1.0.2 should upgrade to 1.0.2y.
Other users should upgrade to 1.1.1j. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2y
(Affected 1.0.2s-1.0.2x).

The OpenSSL public API function X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() attempts
to create a unique hash value based on the issuer and serial number
data contained within an X509 certificate. However it fails to
correctly handle any errors that may occur while parsing the issuer
field (which might occur if the issuer field is maliciously
constructed). This may subsequently result in a NULL pointer deref and
a crash leading to a potential denial of service attack. The function
X509_issuer_and_serial_hash() is never directly called by OpenSSL
itself so applications are only vulnerable if they use this function
directly and they use it on certificates that may have been obtained
from untrusted sources. OpenSSL versions 1.1.1i and below are affected
by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to OpenSSL
1.1.1j. OpenSSL versions 1.0.2x and below are affected by this issue.
However OpenSSL 1.0.2 is out of support and no longer receiving public

Communication to the AMC2 uses a state-of-the-art cryptographic
algorithm for symmetric encryption called Blowfish. An attacker could
retrieve the key from the firmware to decrypt network traffic between
the AMC2 and the host system. Thus, an attacker can exploit this
vulnerability to decrypt and modify network traffic, decrypt and
further investigate the device\'s firmware file, and change the device
configuration. The attacker needs to have access to the local network,
typically even the same subnet.

An XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability was discovered in
the Nutch DmozParser and is known to affect Nutch versions < 1.18. XML
external entity injection (also known as XXE) is a web security
vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with an
application's processing of XML data. It often allows an attacker to
view files on the application server filesystem, and to interact with
any back-end or external systems that the application itself can
access. This issue is fixed in Apache Nutch 1.18.

As specified in the W3C Content Security Policy draft, when creating a
violation report, "User agents need to ensure that the source file is
the URL requested by the page, pre-redirects. If that&#8217;s not possible,
user agents need to strip the URL down to an origin to avoid
unintentional leakage." Under certain types of redirects, Firefox
incorrectly set the source file to be the destination of the
redirects. This was fixed to be the redirect destination's origin.

upon non-async and non-generator getter/setter functions, Hermes would
invoke generator functions and error out on invalid await/yield
positions. This could result in segmentation fault as a consequence of
type confusion error, with a low chance of RCE. This issue affects
Hermes versions prior to v0.10.0.

<p>Depending on configuration of various package managers it is
possible for an attacker to insert a malicious package into a package
manager's repository which can be retrieved and used during
development, build, and release processes. This insertion could lead
to remote code execution. We believe this vulnerability affects
multiple package managers across multiple languages, including but not
limited to: Python/pip, .NET/NuGet, Java/Maven, JavaScript/npm.</p>
<p><strong>Attack scenarios</strong></p> <p>An attacker could take
advantage of this ecosystem-wide issue to cause harm in a variety of
ways. The original attack scenarios were discovered by Alex Birsan and
are detailed in their whitepaper, <a
href="https://medium.com/@alex.birsan/dependency-
confusion-4a5d60fec610">Dependency Confusion: How I Hacked Into Apple,
Microsoft and Dozens of Other Companies</a>.</p> <ul> <li><p>With
basic knowledge of the target ecosystems, an attacker could create an
empty shell for a package and insert malicious code in the install
scripts, give it a high version, and publish it to the public
repository. Vulnerable victim machines will download the higher
version of the package between the public and private repositories and
attempt to install it. Due to code incompatibility it will probably
error out upon import or upon compilation, making it easier to detect;
however the attacker would have gained code execution by that
point.</p> </li> <li><p>An advanced attacker with some inside
knowledge of the target could take a copy of a working package, insert
the malicious code (in the package itself or in the install), and then
publish it to a public repository. The package will likely install and
import correctly, granting the attacker an initial foothold and
persistence.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These two methods could affect target
organizations at any of these various levels:</p> <ul> <li>Developer
machines</li> <li>An entire team if the configuration to import the
malicious package is uploaded to a code repository</li> <li>Continuous
integration pipelines if they pull the malicious packages during the
build, test, and/or deploy stages</li> <li>Customers, download
servers, production services if the malicious code has not been
detected</li> </ul> <p>This remote code execution vulnerability can
only be addressed by reconfiguring installation tools and workflows,
and not by correcting anything in the package repositories themselves.
See the <strong>FAQ</strong> section of this CVE for configuration
guidance.</p>

The Filebird Plugin 4.7.3 introduced a SQL injection vulnerability as
it is making SQL queries without escaping user input data from a HTTP
post request. This is a major vulnerability as the user input is not
escaped and passed directly to the get_col function and it allows SQL
injection. The Rest API endpoint which invokes this function also does
not have any required permissions/authentication and can be accessed
by an anonymous user.
