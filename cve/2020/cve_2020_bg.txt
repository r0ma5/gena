In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
vt: fix memory overlapping when deleting chars in the buffer A memory
overlapping copy occurs when deleting a long line. This memory
overlapping copy can cause data corruption when scr_memcpyw is
optimized to memcpy because memcpy does not ensure its behavior if the
destination buffer overlaps with the source buffer. The line buffer is
not always broken, because the memcpy utilizes the hardware
acceleration, whose result is not deterministic. Fix this problem by
using replacing the scr_memcpyw with scr_memmovew.

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
crypto: qcom-rng - ensure buffer for generate is completely filled The
generate function in struct rng_alg expects that the destination
buffer is completely filled if the function returns 0. qcom_rng_read()
can run into a situation where the buffer is partially filled with
randomness and the remaining part of the buffer is zeroed since
qcom_rng_generate() doesn't check the return value. This issue can be
reproduced by running the following from libkcapi: kcapi-rng -b
9000000 > OUTFILE The generated OUTFILE will have three huge sections
that contain all zeros, and this is caused by the code where the test
'val & PRNG_STATUS_DATA_AVAIL' fails. Let's fix this issue by ensuring
that qcom_rng_read() always returns with a full buffer if the function
returns success. Let's also have qcom_rng_generate() return the
correct value. Here's some statistics from the ent project
(https://www.fourmilab.ch/random/) that shows information about the
quality of the generated numbers: $ ent -c qcom-random-before Value

Optimum compression would reduce the size of this 9000000 byte file by

Serial correlation coefficient is 0.159130 (totally uncorrelated =

In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:
crypto: qcom-rng - fix infinite loop on requests not multiple of
WORD_SZ The commit referenced in the Fixes tag removed the 'break'
from the else branch in qcom_rng_read(), causing an infinite loop
whenever 'max' is not a multiple of WORD_SZ. This can be reproduced
e.g. by running: kcapi-rng -b 67 >/dev/null There are many ways to fix
this without adding back the 'break', but they all seem more awkward
than simply adding it back, so do just that. Tested on a machine with
Qualcomm Amberwing processor.

A flaw in the input validation in TOBY-L2 allows a user to execute
arbitrary operating system commands using specifically crafted AT
commands. This vulnerability requires physical access to the serial
interface of the module or the ability to modify the system or
software which uses its serial interface to send malicious AT
commands. Exploitation of the vulnerability gives full administrative
(root) privileges to the attacker to execute any operating system
command on TOBY-L2 which can lead to modification of the behavior of
the module itself as well as the components connected with it
(depending on its rights on other connected systems). It can further
provide the ability to read system level files and hamper the
availability of the module as well.. This issue affects TOBY-L2
series: TOBY-L200, TOBY-L201, TOBY-L210, TOBY-L220, TOBY-L280.

An Improper Input Validation vulnerability in the Routing Protocol
Daemon (rpd) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows
an unauthenticated, network-based attacker to cause a Denial of
Service (DoS). When a BGP update message is received over an
established BGP session, and that message contains a specific,
optional transitive attribute, this session will be torn down with an
update message error. This issue cannot propagate beyond an affected
system as the processing error occurs as soon as the update is
received. This issue is exploitable remotely as the respective
attribute can propagate through unaffected systems and intermediate AS
(if any). Continuous receipt of a BGP update containing this attribute
will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Some
customers have experienced these BGP session flaps which prompted
Juniper SIRT to release this advisory out of cycle before fixed
releases are widely available as there is an effective workaround.

Versions of Async HTTP Client prior to 1.13.2 are vulnerable to a form
of targeted request manipulation called CRLF injection. This
vulnerability was the result of insufficient validation of HTTP header
field values before sending them to the network. Users are vulnerable
if they pass untrusted data into HTTP header field values without
prior sanitisation. Common use-cases here might be to place usernames
from a database into HTTP header fields. This vulnerability allows
attackers to inject new HTTP header fields, or entirely new requests,
into the data stream. This can cause requests to be understood very
differently by the remote server than was intended. In general, this
is unlikely to result in data disclosure, but it can result in a
number of logical errors and other misbehaviours.

The current implementation of the prctl syscall does not issue an IBPB
immediately during the syscall. The ib_prctl_set function updates the
Thread Information Flags (TIFs) for the task and updates the SPEC_CTRL
MSR on the function __speculation_ctrl_update, but the IBPB is only
issued on the next schedule, when the TIF bits are checked. This
leaves the victim vulnerable to values already injected on the BTB,
prior to the prctl syscall. The patch that added the support for the
conditional mitigation via prctl (ib_prctl_set) dates back to the
kernel 4.9.176. We recommend upgrading past commit
a664ec9158eeddd75121d39c9a0758016097fa96

NLnet Labs Krill supports direct access to the RRDP repository content
through its built-in web server at the "/rrdp" endpoint. Prior to
0.12.1 a direct query for any existing directory under "/rrdp/",
rather than an RRDP file such as "/rrdp/notification.xml" as would be
expected, causes Krill to crash. If the built-in "/rrdp" endpoint is
exposed directly to the internet, then malicious remote parties can
cause the publication server to crash. The repository content is not
affected by this, but the availability of the server and repository
can cause issues if this attack is persistent and is not mitigated.

The public API function BIO_new_NDEF is a helper function used for
streaming ASN.1 data via a BIO. It is primarily used internally to
OpenSSL to support the SMIME, CMS and PKCS7 streaming capabilities,
but may also be called directly by end user applications. The function
receives a BIO from the caller, prepends a new BIO_f_asn1 filter BIO
onto the front of it to form a BIO chain, and then returns the new
head of the BIO chain to the caller. Under certain conditions, for
example if a CMS recipient public key is invalid, the new filter BIO
is freed and the function returns a NULL result indicating a failure.
However, in this case, the BIO chain is not properly cleaned up and
the BIO passed by the caller still retains internal pointers to the
previously freed filter BIO. If the caller then goes on to call
BIO_pop() on the BIO then a use-after-free will occur. This will most
likely result in a crash. This scenario occurs directly in the
internal function B64_write_ASN1() which may cause BIO_new_NDEF() to
be called and will subsequently call BIO_pop() on the BIO. This
internal function is in turn called by the public API functions
PEM_write_bio_ASN1_stream, PEM_write_bio_CMS_stream,
PEM_write_bio_PKCS7_stream, SMIME_write_ASN1, SMIME_write_CMS and
SMIME_write_PKCS7. Other public API functions that may be impacted by
this include i2d_ASN1_bio_stream, BIO_new_CMS, BIO_new_PKCS7,
i2d_CMS_bio_stream and i2d_PKCS7_bio_stream. The OpenSSL cms and smime
command line applications are similarly affected.

An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
application tries to load malformed PKCS7 data with the d2i_PKCS7(),
d2i_PKCS7_bio() or d2i_PKCS7_fp() functions. The result of the
dereference is an application crash which could lead to a denial of

An invalid pointer dereference on read can be triggered when an
application tries to check a malformed DSA public key by the
EVP_PKEY_public_check() function. This will most likely lead to an
application crash. This function can be called on public keys supplied
from untrusted sources which could allow an attacker to cause a denial
of service attack. The TLS implementation in OpenSSL does not call
this function but applications might call the function if there are
additional security requirements imposed by standards such as FIPS
140-3.

There is a logic error in io_uring's implementation which can be used
to trigger a use-after-free vulnerability leading to privilege
escalation. In the io_prep_async_work function the assumption that the
last io_grab_identity call cannot return false is not true, and in
this case the function will use the init_cred or the previous linked
requests identity to do operations instead of using the current
identity. This can lead to reference counting issues causing use-
after-free. We recommend upgrading past version 5.10.161.

Rapid7 Velociraptor allows users to be created with different
privileges on the server. Administrators are generally allowed to run
any command on the server including writing arbitrary files. However,
lower privilege users are generally forbidden from writing or
modifying files on the server. The VQL copy() function applies
permission checks for reading files but does not check for permission
to write files. This allows a low privilege user (usually, users with
the Velociraptor "investigator" role) to overwrite files on the
server, including Velociraptor configuration files. To exploit this
vulnerability, the attacker must already have a Velociraptor user
account at a low privilege level (at least "analyst") and be able to
log into the GUI and create a notebook where they can run the VQL
query invoking the copy() VQL function. Typically, most users deploy
Velociraptor with limited access to a trusted group (most users will
be administrators within the GUI). This vulnerability is associated
with program files https://github.Com/Velocidex/velociraptor/blob/mast
er/vql/filesystem/copy.go https://github.Com/Velocidex/velociraptor/bl
ob/master/vql/filesystem/copy.go and program routines copy(). This
issue affects Velociraptor versions before 0.6.7-5. Version 0.6.7-5,
released January 16, 2023, fixes the issue.

There is a type confusion vulnerability relating to X.400 address
processing inside an X.509 GeneralName. X.400 addresses were parsed as
an ASN1_STRING but the public structure definition for GENERAL_NAME
incorrectly specified the type of the x400Address field as ASN1_TYPE.
This field is subsequently interpreted by the OpenSSL function
GENERAL_NAME_cmp as an ASN1_TYPE rather than an ASN1_STRING. When CRL
checking is enabled (i.e. the application sets the
X509_V_FLAG_CRL_CHECK flag), this vulnerability may allow an attacker
to pass arbitrary pointers to a memcmp call, enabling them to read
memory contents or enact a denial of service. In most cases, the
attack requires the attacker to provide both the certificate chain and
CRL, neither of which need to have a valid signature. If the attacker
only controls one of these inputs, the other input must already
contain an X.400 address as a CRL distribution point, which is
uncommon. As such, this vulnerability is most likely to only affect
applications which have implemented their own functionality for
retrieving CRLs over a network.

Reference: MISC:https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor
Reference: URL:https://github.com/Velocidex/velociraptor

Rapid7 Velociraptor did not properly sanitize the client ID parameter
to the CreateCollection API, allowing a directory traversal in where
the collection task could be written. It was possible to provide a
client id of "../clients/server" to schedule the collection for the
server (as a server artifact), but only require privileges to schedule
collections on the client. Normally, to schedule an artifact on the
server, the COLLECT_SERVER permission is required. This permission is
normally only granted to "administrator" role. Due to this issue, it
is sufficient to have the COLLECT_CLIENT privilege, which is normally
granted to the "investigator" role. To exploit this vulnerability, the
attacker must already have a Velociraptor user account at least
"investigator" level, and be able to authenticate to the GUI and issue
an API call to the backend. Typically, most users deploy Velociraptor
with limited access to a trusted group, and most users will already be
administrators within the GUI. This issue affects Velociraptor
versions before 0.6.7-5. Version 0.6.7-5, released January 16, 2023,
fixes the issue.

associated with the qsm_remove_file_fd_question AJAX action in
versions up to, and including, 8.0.8. This makes it possible for
unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary media files.

The Quiz And Survey Master plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 8.0.8.
This is due to missing nonce validation on the function associated
with the qsm_remove_file_fd_question AJAX action. This makes it
possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary media files
via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into
performing an action such as clicking on a link.

The Launchpad plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site
Scripting via several of its settings parameters in versions up to,
and including, 1.0.13 due to insufficient input sanitization and
output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers,
with administrator-level permissions and above, to inject arbitrary
web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an
injected page. This only affects multi-site installations and
installations where unfiltered_html has been disabled.

The Birthday attack against 64-bit block ciphers flaw (CVE-2016-2183)
was reported for the health checks port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy
component. Even though the CVE-2016-2183 has been fixed in the etcd
components, to enable periodic health checks from kubelet, it was
necessary to open up a new port (9979) on etcd grpc-proxy, hence this
port might be considered as still vulnerable to the same type of
vulnerability. The health checks on etcd grpc-proxy do not contain
sensitive data (only metrics data), therefore the potential impact
related to this vulnerability is minimal. The CVE-2023-0296 has been
assigned to this issue to track the permanent fix in the etcd
component.

A timing side-channel in the handling of RSA ClientKeyExchange
messages was discovered in GnuTLS. This side-channel can be sufficient
to recover the key encrypted in the RSA ciphertext across a network in
a Bleichenbacher style attack. To achieve a successful decryption the
attacker would need to send a large amount of specially crafted
messages to the vulnerable server. By recovering the secret from the
ClientKeyExchange message, the attacker would be able to decrypt the
application data exchanged over that connection.

Reference: URL:https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20230207.txt

A NULL pointer can be dereferenced when signatures are being verified
on PKCS7 signed or signedAndEnveloped data. In case the hash algorithm
used for the signature is known to the OpenSSL library but the
implementation of the hash algorithm is not available the digest
initialization will fail. There is a missing check for the return
value from the initialization function which later leads to invalid
usage of the digest API most likely leading to a crash. The
unavailability of an algorithm can be caused by using FIPS enabled
configuration of providers or more commonly by not loading the legacy
provider. PKCS7 data is processed by the SMIME library calls and also
by the time stamp (TS) library calls. The TLS implementation in
OpenSSL does not call these functions however third party applications
would be affected if they call these functions to verify signatures on
untrusted data.

The YouTube Embedded 1.2 SDK binds to a service within the YouTube
Main App. After binding, a remote context is created with the flags
Context.CONTEXT_INCLUDE_CODE | Context.CONTEXT_IGNORE_SECURITY. This
allows the client app to remotely load code from YouTube Main App by
retrieving the Main App&#8217;s ClassLoader. A potential vulnerability in
the binding logic used by the client SDK where the SDK ends up calling
bindService() on a malicious app rather than YT Main App. This creates
a vulnerability where the SDK can load the malicious app&#8217;s ClassLoader
instead, allowing the malicious app to load arbitrary code into the
calling app whenever the embedded SDK is invoked. In order to trigger
this vulnerability, an attacker must masquerade the Youtube app and
install it on a device, have a second app that uses the Embedded
player and typically distribute both to the victim outside of the Play
Store.

install a tls context (struct tls_context) on a connected tcp socket.
The context is not cleared if this socket is disconnected and reused
as a listener. If a new socket is created from the listener, the
context is inherited and vulnerable. The setsockopt TCP_ULP operation
does not require any privilege. We recommend upgrading past commit

A security vulnerability has been identified in all supported versions
of OpenSSL related to the verification of X.509 certificate chains
that include policy constraints. Attackers may be able to exploit this
vulnerability by creating a malicious certificate chain that triggers
exponential use of computational resources, leading to a denial-of-
service (DoS) attack on affected systems. Policy processing is
disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the `-policy'
argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

Applications that use a non-default option when verifying certificates
may be vulnerable to an attack from a malicious CA to circumvent
certain checks. Invalid certificate policies in leaf certificates are
silently ignored by OpenSSL and other certificate policy checks are
skipped for that certificate. A malicious CA could use this to
deliberately assert invalid certificate policies in order to
circumvent policy checking on the certificate altogether. Policy
processing is disabled by default but can be enabled by passing the
`-policy' argument to the command line utilities or by calling the
`X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()' function.

Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/09/28/4

The function X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy() is documented to
implicitly enable the certificate policy check when doing certificate
verification. However the implementation of the function does not
enable the check which allows certificates with invalid or incorrect
policies to pass the certificate verification. As suddenly enabling
the policy check could break existing deployments it was decided to
keep the existing behavior of the X509_VERIFY_PARAM_add0_policy()
function. Instead the applications that require OpenSSL to perform
certificate policy check need to use X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set1_policies()
or explicitly enable the policy check by calling
X509_VERIFY_PARAM_set_flags() with the X509_V_FLAG_POLICY_CHECK flag
argument. Certificate policy checks are disabled by default in OpenSSL
and are not commonly used by applications.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
Starting with the 8.1 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability
affecting the core plugin GeoMap. The stored XSS vulnerability was
possible due to map attributions weren't properly sanitized and
allowed arbitrary JavaScript to be executed in the context of the
currently authorized user of the Grafana instance. An attacker needs
to have the Editor role in order to change a panel to include a map
attribution containing JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege
escalation is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a
known password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin
role executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may
upgrade to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.

The Quick Restaurant Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
Insecure Direct Object Reference in versions up to, and including,
2.0.2. This is due to the fact that during menu item
deletion/modification, the plugin does not verify that the post ID

possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access or
higher, to modify or delete arbitrary posts.

The Quick Restaurant Menu plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
authorization bypass due to a missing capability check on its AJAX
actions in versions up to, and including, 2.0.2. This makes it
possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level
permissions and above, to invoke those actions intended for
administrator use. Actions include menu item creation, update and
deletion and other menu management functions. Since the plugin does
not verify that a post ID passed to one of its AJAX actions belongs to
a menu item, this can lead to arbitrary post deletion/alteration.

The ContentStudio plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authorization
bypass due to a missing capability check on several functions in
versions up to, and including, 1.2.5. This makes it possible for
unauthenticated attackers to obtain the blog metadata (via the

including, 4.2.9 due to insufficient input sanitization and output
escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with
Contributor+ role to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will
execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.

ubireader_extract_files is vulnerable to path traversal when run
against specifically crafted UBIFS files, allowing the attacker to
overwrite files outside of the extraction directory (provided the
process has write access to that file or directory). This is due to
the fact that a node name (dent_node.name) is considered trusted and
joined to the extraction directory path during processing, then the
node content is written to that joined path. By crafting a malicious
UBIFS file with node names holding path traversal payloads (e.g.
../../tmp/outside.txt), it's possible to force ubi_reader to write
outside of the extraction directory. This issue affects ubi-reader
before 0.8.5.

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability.
Starting with the 7.0 branch, Grafana had a stored XSS vulnerability
in the trace view visualization. The stored XSS vulnerability was
possible due the value of a span's attributes/resources were not
properly sanitized and this will be rendered when the span's
attributes/resources are expanded. An attacker needs to have the
Editor role in order to change the value of a trace view visualization
to contain JavaScript. This means that vertical privilege escalation
is possible, where a user with Editor role can change to a known
password for a user having Admin role if the user with Admin role
executes malicious JavaScript viewing a dashboard. Users may upgrade
to version 8.5.21, 9.2.13 and 9.3.8 to receive a fix.

Docker Desktop before 4.17.0 allows an unprivileged user to bypass
Enhanced Container Isolation (ECI) restrictions by setting the Docker
host to docker.raw.sock, or npipe:////.pipe/docker_engine_linux on
Windows, via the -H (--host) CLI flag or the DOCKER_HOST environment
variable and launch containers without the additional hardening
features provided by ECI. This would not affect already running
containers, nor containers launched through the usual approach
(without Docker's raw socket). The affected functionality is available
for Docker Business customers only and assumes an environment where
users are not granted local root or Administrator privileges. This
issue has been fixed in Docker Desktop 4.17.0. Affected Docker Desktop
versions: from 4.13.0 before 4.17.0.

The Metform Elementor Contact Form Builder for WordPress is vulnerable
to Cross-Site Scripting by using the 'fname' attribute of the
'mf_thankyou' shortcode to echo unescaped form submissions in versions
up to, and including, 3.3.0. This allows authenticated attackers, with
contributor-level permissions or above, to inject arbitrary web
scripts in pages that will execute when the victim visits a a page
containing the shortcode when the submission id is present in the
query string. Note that getting the JavaScript to execute requires
user interaction as the victim must visit a crafted link with the form
entry id, but the script itself is stored in the site database.
Additionally this requires successful payment, increasing the
complexity.

The Wicked Folders plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site
Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 2.18.16. This is due
to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the ajax_delete_folder
function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to
invoke this function via forged request granted they can trick a site
administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link
leading them to perform actions intended for administrators such as
changing the folder structure maintained by the plugin.

The Profile Builder &#8211; User Profile & User Registration Forms plugin
for WordPress is vulnerable to sensitive information disclosure via
the [user_meta] shortcode in versions up to, and including 3.9.0. This
is due to insufficient restriction on sensitive user meta values that
can be called via that shortcode. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level permissions, and above
to retrieve sensitive user meta that can be used to gain access to a
high privileged user account. This does require the Usermeta shortcode
be enabled to be exploited.

Version 10.11 of webMethods OneData runs an embedded instance of Azul
Zulu Java 11.0.15 which hosts a Java RMI registry (listening on TCP
port 2099 by default) and two RMI interfaces (listening on a single,
dynamically assigned TCP high port). Port 2099 serves as a Java Remote
Method Invocation (RMI) registry which allows for remotely loading and
processing data via RMI interfaces. An unauthenticated attacker with
network connectivity to the RMI registry and RMI interface ports can
abuse this functionality to instruct the webMethods OneData
application to load a malicious serialized Java object as a parameter
to one of the available Java methods presented by the RMI interface.
Once deserialized on the vulnerable server, the malicious code runs as
whichever operating system account is used to run the software, which
in most cases is the local System account on Windows.

The Intuitive Custom Post Order plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to
SQL Injection in versions up to, and including, 3.1.3, due to
insufficient escaping on the user supplied 'objects' and 'tags'
parameters and lack of sufficient preparation in the 'update_options'
function as well as the 'refresh' function which runs queries on the
same values. This allows authenticated attackers, with administrator
permissions, to append additional SQL queries into already existing
queries that can be used to extract sensitive information from the
database. Note that this attack may only be practical on
configurations where it is possible to bypass addslashes due to the
database using a nonstandard character set such as GBK.

The WP Meta SEO plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized
access of data due to a missing capability check on the
listPostsCategory function in versions up to, and including, 4.5.3.
This makes it possible for authenticated attackers with subscriber-
level access to get post listings by category as long as those posts
are published. This vulnerability occurred as a result of the plugin
relying on nonce checks as a means of access control, and that nonce
being accessible to all authenticated users regardless of role.

This vulnerability in the Snyk Kubernetes Monitor can result in
irrelevant data being posted to a Snyk Organization, which could in
turn obfuscate other, relevant, security issues. It does not expose
the user of the integration to any direct security risk and no user
data can be leaked. To exploit the vulnerability the attacker does not
need to be authenticated to Snyk but does need to know the target's
Integration ID (which may or may not be the same as the Organization
ID, although this is an unpredictable UUID in either case).

A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel. The tun/tap sockets have their
socket UID hardcoded to 0 due to a type confusion in their
initialization function. While it will be often correct, as tuntap
devices require CAP_NET_ADMIN, it may not always be the case, e.g., a
non-root user only having that capability. This would make tun/tap
sockets being incorrectly treated in filtering/routing decisions,
possibly bypassing network filters.

Reference: MLIST:[oss-security] 20231105 CVE-2023-1078: Linux: rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() bugs
Reference: URL:http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/11/05/1

A flaw was found in the Linux Kernel in RDS (Reliable Datagram
Sockets) protocol. The rds_rm_zerocopy_callback() uses list_entry() on
the head of a list causing a type confusion. Local user can trigger
this with rds_message_put(). Type confusion leads to `struct
rds_msg_zcopy_info *info` actually points to something else that is
potentially controlled by local user. It is known how to trigger this,
which causes an out of bounds access, and a lock corruption.

A flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A use-after-free may be
triggered in asus_kbd_backlight_set when plugging/disconnecting in a
malicious USB device, which advertises itself as an Asus device.
Similarly to the previous known CVE-2023-25012, but in asus devices,
the work_struct may be scheduled by the LED controller while the
device is disconnecting, triggering a use-after-free on the struct
asus_kbd_leds *led structure. A malicious USB device may exploit the
issue to cause memory corruption with controlled data.

Issue summary: The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit
ARM platform contains a bug that could cause it to read past the input
buffer, leading to a crash. Impact summary: Applications that use the
AES-XTS algorithm on the 64 bit ARM platform can crash in rare
circumstances. The AES-XTS algorithm is usually used for disk
encryption. The AES-XTS cipher decryption implementation for 64 bit
ARM platform will read past the end of the ciphertext buffer if the
ciphertext size is 4 mod 5 in 16 byte blocks, e.g. 144 bytes or 1024
bytes. If the memory after the ciphertext buffer is unmapped, this
will trigger a crash which results in a denial of service. If an
attacker can control the size and location of the ciphertext buffer
being decrypted by an application using AES-XTS on 64 bit ARM, the
application is affected. This is fairly unlikely making this issue a
Low severity one.

Reference: URL:https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2024/02/msg00007.html

A vulnerability was discovered in ImageMagick where a specially
created SVG file loads itself and causes a segmentation fault. This
flaw allows a remote attacker to pass a specially crafted SVG file
that leads to a segmentation fault, generating many trash files in
"/tmp," resulting in a denial of service. When ImageMagick crashes, it
generates a lot of trash files. These trash files can be large if the
SVG file contains many render actions. In a denial of service attack,
if a remote attacker uploads an SVG file of size t, ImageMagick
generates files of size 103*t. If an attacker uploads a 100M SVG, the
server will generate about 10G.

Reference: URL:https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared/security/advisories/GHSA-7mjv-x3jf-545x

A vulnerability has been discovered in cloudflared's installer (<=
2023.3.0) for Windows 32-bits devices that allows a local attacker
with no administrative permissions to escalate their privileges on the
affected device. This vulnerability exists because the MSI installer
used by cloudflared relied on a world-writable directory. An attacker
with local access to the device (without Administrator rights) can use
symbolic links to trick the MSI installer into deleting files in
locations that the attacker would otherwise have no access to. By
creating a symlink from the world-writable directory to the target
file, the attacker can manipulate the MSI installer's repair
functionality to delete the target file during the repair process.
Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to delete
important system files or replace them with malicious files,
potentially leading to the affected device being compromised. The
cloudflared client itself is not affected by this vulnerability, only
the installer for 32-bit Windows devices.

An unprivileged (non-admin) user can exploit an Improper Access
Control vulnerability in the Cloudflare WARP Client for Windows (<=
2022.12.582.0) to perform privileged operations with SYSTEM context by
working with a combination of opportunistic locks (oplock) and
symbolic links (which can both be created by an unprivileged user).
After installing the Cloudflare WARP Client (admin privileges
required), an MSI-Installer is placed under C:\Windows\Installer. The
vulnerability lies in the repair function of this MSI. ImpactAn
unprivileged (non-admin) user can exploit this vulnerability to
perform privileged operations with SYSTEM context, including deleting
arbitrary files and reading arbitrary file content. This can lead to a
variety of attacks, including the manipulation of system files and
privilege escalation. PatchesA new installer with a fix that addresses
this vulnerability was released in version 2023.3.381.0. While the
WARP Client itself is not vulnerable (only the installer), users are
encouraged to upgrade to the latest version and delete any older
installers present in their systems.

The GMAce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.5.2. This is due to
missing nonce validation on the gmace_manager_server function called
via the wp_ajax_gmace_manager AJAX action. This makes it possible for
unauthenticated attackers to modify arbitrary files and achieve remote
code execution via a forged request granted they can trick a site
administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.

A vulnerability exists in the component RTU500 Scripting interface.
When a client connects to a server using TLS, the server presents a
certificate. This certificate links a public key to the identity of
the service and is signed by a Certification Authority (CA), allowing
the client to validate that the remote service can be trusted and is
not malicious. If the client does not validate the parameters of the
certificate, then attackers could be able to spoof the identity of the
service. An attacker could exploit the vulnerability by using faking
the identity of a RTU500 device and intercepting the messages
initiated via the RTU500 Scripting interface.

The Display post meta, term meta, comment meta, and user meta plugin
for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting via post
metadata in versions up to, and including, 0.4.1 due to insufficient
input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for
authenticated attackers, with contributor-level permissions and above,
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a
user accesses an injected page.

Coverity versions prior to 2023.3.2 are vulnerable to forced browsing,
which exposes authenticated resources to unauthorized actors. The root
cause of this vulnerability is an insecurely configured servlet
mapping for the underlying Apache Tomcat server. As a result, the
downloads directory and its contents are accessible. 5.9

A flaw was found in Keycloak. This flaw depends on a non-default
configuration "Revalidate Client Certificate" to be enabled and the
reverse proxy is not validating the certificate before Keycloak. Using
this method an attacker may choose the certificate which will be
validated by the server. If this happens and the
KC_SPI_TRUSTSTORE_FILE_FILE variable is missing/misconfigured, any
trustfile may be accepted with the logging information of "Cannot
validate client certificate trust: Truststore not available". This may
not impact availability as the attacker would have no access to the
server, but consumer applications Integrity or Confidentiality may be
impacted considering a possible access to them. Considering the
environment is correctly set to use "Revalidate Client Certificate"
this flaw is avoidable.

When sampling randomness for a shared secret, the implementation of
Kyber and FrodoKEM, did not check whether crypto/rand.Read() returns
an error. In rare deployment cases (error thrown by the Read()
function), this could lead to a predictable shared secret. The tkn20
and blindrsa components did not check whether enough randomness was
returned from the user provided randomness source. Typically the user
provides crypto/rand.Reader, which in the vast majority of cases will
always return the right number random bytes. In the cases where it
does not, or the user provides a source that does not, the blinding
for blindrsa is weak and integrity of the plaintext is not ensured in
tkn20.

Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.2.3. This is due
to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the saveLang function.
This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to change the
plugin's quick language translation settings via a forged request
granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action
such as clicking on a link.

A use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux Kernel io_uring system can
be exploited to achieve local privilege escalation. The
io_file_get_fixed function lacks the presence of ctx->uring_lock which
can lead to a Use-After-Free vulnerability due a race condition with
fixed files getting unregistered. We recommend upgrading past commit
da24142b1ef9fd5d36b76e36bab328a5b27523e8.

The WP Data Access plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege
escalation in versions up to, and including, 5.3.7. This is due to a
lack of authorization checks on the multiple_roles_update function.
This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal
permissions such as a subscriber, to modify their user role by
supplying the 'wpda_role[]' parameter during a profile update. This
requires the 'Enable role management' setting to be enabled for the
site.

The Web Stories for WordPress plugin supports the WordPress built-in
functionality of protecting content with a password. The content is
then only accessible to website visitors after entering the password.
In WordPress, users with the "Author" role can create stories, but
don't have the ability to edit password protected stories. The
vulnerability allowed users with said role to bypass this permission
check when trying to duplicate the protected story in the plugin's own
dashboard, giving them access to the seemingly protected content. We
recommend upgrading to version 1.32 or beyond commit

The Linux kernel allows userspace processes to enable mitigations by
calling prctl with PR_SET_SPECULATION_CTRL which disables the
speculation feature as well as by using seccomp. We had noticed that
on VMs of at least one major cloud provider, the kernel still left the
victim process exposed to attacks in some cases even after enabling
the spectre-BTI mitigation with prctl. The same behavior can be
observed on a bare-metal machine when forcing the mitigation to IBRS
on boot command line. This happened because when plain IBRS was
enabled (not enhanced IBRS), the kernel had some logic that determined
that STIBP was not needed. The IBRS bit implicitly protects against
cross-thread branch target injection. However, with legacy IBRS, the
IBRS bit was cleared on returning to userspace, due to performance
reasons, which disabled the implicit STIBP and left userspace threads
vulnerable to cross-thread branch target injection against which STIBP
protects.

two previously unknown issues. The attacker first exploited
CVE-2023-20198 to gain initial access and issued a privilege 15
command to create a local user and password combination. This allowed
the user to log in with normal user access. The attacker then
exploited another component of the web UI feature, leveraging the new
local user to elevate privilege to root and write the implant to the
file system. Cisco has assigned CVE-2023-20273 to this issue.
CVE-2023-20198 has been assigned a CVSS Score of 10.0. CVE-2023-20273
has been assigned a CVSS Score of 7.2. Both of these CVEs are being
tracked by CSCwh87343.
