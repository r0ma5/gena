Reference: URL:https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/downloads/unbound/CVE-2024-1931.txt

NLnet Labs Unbound version 1.18.0 up to and including version 1.19.1
contain a vulnerability that can cause denial of service by a certain
code path that can lead to an infinite loop. Unbound 1.18.0 introduced
a feature that removes EDE records from responses with size higher
than the client's advertised buffer size. Before removing all the EDE
records however, it would try to see if trimming the extra text fields
on those records would result in an acceptable size while still
retaining the EDE codes. Due to an unchecked condition, the code that
trims the text of the EDE records could loop indefinitely. This
happens when Unbound would reply with attached EDE information on a
positive reply and the client's buffer size is smaller than the needed
space to include EDE records. The vulnerability can only be triggered
when the 'ede: yes' option is used; non default configuration. From
version 1.19.2 on, the code is fixed to avoid looping indefinitely.

The Simple Membership plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored
Cross-Site Scripting via the 'Display Name' parameter in all versions
up to, and including, 4.4.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and
output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers
to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a
user accesses an injected page. This vulnerability requires social
engineering to successfully exploit, and the impact would be very
limited due to the attacker requiring a user to login as the user with
the injected payload for execution.

The Booster Elite for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable
to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the
wc_add_new_product() function in all versions up to, and including,
7.1.7. This makes it possible for customer-level attackers, and above,
to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make
remote code execution possible. This is only exploitable when the user
product upload functionality is enabled.

present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target
system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files,
retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco
Identity Services Engine (ISE) could allow an authenticated, remote
attacker to perform a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against
a user of the interface on an affected device. This vulnerability
exists because the web-based management interface does not properly
validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by injecting malicious code into specific pages of the
interface. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute
arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or
access sensitive, browser-based information.

vulnerability is due to the improper processing of user-provided data
that is being read into memory. An attacker could exploit this
vulnerability by sending a crafted message to a listening port of an
affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to
execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the
privileges of the web services user. With access to the underlying
operating system, the attacker could also establish root access on the

A vulnerability in the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) and SFTP feature of
Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to
create or overwrite files in a system directory, which could lead to a
denial of service (DoS) condition. The attacker would require valid
user credentials to perform this attack. This vulnerability is due to
a lack of proper validation of SCP and SFTP CLI input parameters. An
attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the
device and issuing SCP or SFTP CLI commands with specific parameters.
A successful exploit could allow the attacker to impact the
functionality of the device, which could lead to a DoS condition. The
device may need to be manually rebooted to recover. Note: This
vulnerability is exploitable only when a local user invokes SCP or
SFTP commands at the Cisco IOS XR CLI. A local user with
administrative privileges could exploit this vulnerability remotely.

A vulnerability with the access control list (ACL) management within a
stacked switch configuration of Cisco Business 250 Series Smart
Switches and Business 350 Series Managed Switches could allow an
unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass protection offered by a
configured ACL on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to
incorrect processing of ACLs on a stacked configuration when either
the primary or backup switches experience a full stack reload or power
cycle. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted
traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow
the attacker to bypass configured ACLs, causing traffic to be dropped
or forwarded in an unexpected manner. The attacker does not have
control over the conditions that result in the device being in the
vulnerable state. Note: In the vulnerable state, the ACL would be
correctly applied on the primary devices but could be incorrectly
applied to the backup devices.

A vulnerability in the DHCP version 4 (DHCPv4) server feature of Cisco
IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to
trigger a crash of the dhcpd process, resulting in a denial of service
(DoS) condition. This vulnerability exists because certain DHCPv4
messages are improperly validated when they are processed by an
affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by
sending a malformed DHCPv4 message to an affected device. A successful
exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash of the dhcpd
process. While the dhcpd process is restarting, which may take
approximately two minutes, DHCPv4 server services are unavailable on
the affected device. This could temporarily prevent network access to
clients that join the network during that time period and rely on the
DHCPv4 server of the affected device. Notes: Only the dhcpd process
crashes and eventually restarts automatically. The router does not
reload. This vulnerability only applies to DHCPv4. DHCP version 6
(DHCPv6) is not affected.

Reference: URL:https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipv6-mpls-dos-R9ycXkwM

A vulnerability with the handling of MPLS traffic for Cisco NX-OS
Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the
netstack process to unexpectedly restart, which could cause the device
to stop processing network traffic or to reload. This vulnerability is
due to lack of proper error checking when processing an ingress MPLS
frame. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a
crafted IPv6 packet that is encapsulated within an MPLS frame to an
MPLS-enabled interface of the targeted device. A successful exploit
could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.
Note: The IPv6 packet can be generated multiple hops away from the
targeted device and then encapsulated within MPLS. The DoS condition
may occur when the NX-OS device processes the packet.

Versions of the package jsrsasign before 11.0.0 are vulnerable to
Observable Discrepancy via the RSA PKCS1.5 or RSAOAEP decryption
process. An attacker can decrypt ciphertexts by exploiting the Marvin
security flaw. Exploiting this vulnerability requires the attacker to
have access to a large number of ciphertexts encrypted with the same
key. Workaround The vulnerability can be mitigated by finding and
replacing RSA and RSAOAEP decryption with another crypto library.

package dash before 2.15.0; versions of the package dash-html-
components before 2.0.0; versions of the package dash-html-components
before 2.0.16 are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) when the
href of the a tag is controlled by an adversary. An authenticated
attacker who stores a view that exploits this vulnerability could
steal the data that's visible to another user who opens that view -
not just the data already included on the page, but they could also,
in theory, make additional requests and access other data accessible
to this user. In some cases, they could also steal the access tokens
of that user, which would allow the attacker to act as that user,
including viewing other apps and resources hosted on the same server.
**Note:** This is only exploitable in Dash apps that include some
mechanism to store user input to be reloaded by a different user.

This affects versions of the package angular from 1.3.0. A regular
expression used to split the value of the ng-srcset directive is
vulnerable to super-linear runtime due to backtracking. With large
carefully-crafted input, this can result in catastrophic backtracking
and cause a denial of service. **Note:** This package is EOL and will
not receive any updates to address this issue. Users should migrate to

Versions of the package svix before 1.17.0 are vulnerable to
Authentication Bypass due to an issue in the verify function where
signatures of different lengths are incorrectly compared. An attacker
can bypass signature verification by providing a shorter signature
that matches the beginning of the actual signature. **Note:** The
attacker would need to know a victim uses the Rust library for
verification,no easy way to automatically check that; and uses
webhooks by a service that uses Svix, and then figure out a way to
craft a malicious payload that will actually include all of the
correct identifiers needed to trick the receivers to cause actual
issues.

All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are
vulnerable to Insufficient Session Expiration due to improper user
session invalidation upon clicking the "Sign Out" button. User
sessions remain valid even after requests are sent to /logout and
/oauth2/google/logout. Attackers who gain access to an active but
supposedly logged-out session can perform unauthorized actions on
behalf of the user.

All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are
vulnerable to Improper Validation of Array Index when parsing a
Caddyfile. Multiple parsing functions in the affected library do not
validate whether their input values are nil before attempting to
access elements, which can lead to a panic (index out of range).
Panics during the parsing of a configuration file may introduce
ambiguity and vulnerabilities, hindering the correct interpretation
and configuration of the web server.

Versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security before
1.0.42 are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness due to using an insecure
random number generation library which could possibly be predicted via
a brute-force search. Attackers could use the potentially predictable
nonce value used for authentication purposes in the OAuth flow to
conduct OAuth replay attacks. In addition, insecure randomness is used
while generating multifactor authentication (MFA) secrets and creating
API keys in the database package.

All versions of the package github.com/greenpau/caddy-security are
vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS) via the Referer header, due
to improper input sanitization. Although the Referer header is
sanitized by escaping some characters that can allow XSS (e.g., [&],
[<], [>], ["], [']), it does not account for the attack based on the
JavaScript URL scheme (e.g., javascript:alert(document.domain)//
payload). Exploiting this vulnerability may not be trivial, but it
could lead to the execution of malicious scripts in the context of the
target user&#8217;s browser, compromising user sessions.

An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in BGP
session processing of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved
allows an unauthenticated network-based attacker, using specific
timing outside the attacker's control, to flap BGP sessions and cause
the routing protocol daemon (rpd) process to crash and restart,
leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) condition. Continued BGP session
flapping will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
This issue only affects routers configured with non-stop routing (NSR)
enabled. Graceful Restart (GR) helper mode, enabled by default, is
also required for this issue to be exploitable. Note: NSR is not
supported on the SRX Series and is therefore not affected by this
vulnerability. When the BGP session flaps on the NSR-enabled router,
the device enters GR-helper/LLGR-helper mode due to the peer having
negotiated GR/LLGR-restarter capability and the backup BGP requests
for replication of the GR/LLGR-helper session, master BGP schedules,
and initiates replication of GR/LLGR stale routes to the backup BGP.
In this state, if the BGP session with the BGP peer comes up again,
unsolicited replication is initiated for the peer without cleaning up
the ongoing GR/LLGR-helper mode replication. This parallel two
instances of replication for the same peer leads to the assert if the
BGP session flaps again. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS

An Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions vulnerability in the
broadband edge subscriber management daemon (bbe-smgd) of Juniper
Networks Junos OS on MX Series allows an attacker directly connected
to the vulnerable system who repeatedly flaps DHCP subscriber sessions
to cause a slow memory leak, ultimately leading to a Denial of Service
(DoS). Memory can only be recovered by manually restarting bbe-smgd.
This issue only occurs if BFD liveness detection for DHCP subscribers
is enabled. Systems without BFD liveness detection enabled are not
vulnerable to this issue. Indication of the issue can be observed by
periodically executing the 'show system processes extensive' command,
which will indicate an increase in memory allocation for bbe-smgd. A
small amount of memory is leaked every time a DHCP subscriber logs in,
which will become visible over time, ultimately leading to memory
starvation. user@junos> show system processes extensive | match bbe-

An Improper Access Control vulnerability in the Juniper Networks
Paragon Active Assurance Control Center allows an unauthenticated
network-based attacker to access reports without authenticating,
potentially containing sensitive configuration information. A feature
was introduced in version 3.1.0 of the Paragon Active Assurance
Control Center which allows users to selectively share account data.
By exploiting this vulnerability, it is possible to access reports
without being logged in, resulting in the opportunity for malicious
exfiltration of user data. Note that the Paragon Active Assurance
Control Center SaaS offering is not affected by this issue. This issue
affects Juniper Networks Paragon Active Assurance versions 3.1.0,
3.2.0, 3.2.2, 3.3.0, 3.3.1, 3.4.0. This issue does not affect Juniper
Networks Paragon Active Assurance versions earlier than 3.1.0.

A Heap-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in the Routing Protocol
Daemon (RPD) of Juniper Networks Junos OS and Junos OS Evolved allows
an unauthenticated, network based attacker to cause a Denial of
Service (DoS). If an attacker sends a specific BGP UPDATE message to
the device, this will cause a memory overwrite and therefore an RPD
crash and restart in the backup Routing Engine (RE). Continued receipt
of these packets will cause a sustained Denial of Service (DoS)
condition in the backup RE. The primary RE is not impacted by this
issue and there is no impact on traffic. This issue only affects
devices with NSR enabled. Note: NSR is not supported on the SRX Series
and is therefore not affected by this vulnerability. This issue
requires an attacker to have an established BGP session to a system
affected by the issue. This issue affects both eBGP and iBGP
implementations. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS * All

An Improper Neutralization of Equivalent Special Elements
vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper
Networks Junos OS on PTX Series allows a unauthenticated, adjacent
attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS). When MPLS packets are
meant to be sent to a flexible tunnel interface (FTI) and if the FTI

An Unsupported Feature in the UI vulnerability in Juniper Networks
Junos OS on MX Series and EX9200 Series allows an unauthenticated,
network-based attacker to cause partial impact to the integrity of the
device. If the "tcp-reset" option is added to the "reject" action in
an IPv6 filter which matches on "payload-protocol", packets are
permitted instead of rejected. This happens because the payload-
protocol match criteria is not supported in the kernel filter causing
it to accept all packets without taking any other action. As a fix the
payload-protocol match will be treated the same as a "next-header"

SideQuest is a place to get virtual reality applications for Oculus
Quest. The SideQuest desktop application uses deep links with a custom
protocol (`sidequest://`) to trigger actions in the application from
its web contents. Because, prior to version 0.10.35, the deep link
URLs were not sanitized properly in all cases, a one-click remote code
execution can be achieved in cases when a device is connected, the
user is presented with a malicious link and clicks it from within the
application. As of version 0.10.35, the custom protocol links within
the electron application are now being parsed and sanitized properly.

runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux
according to the OCI specification. In runc 1.1.11 and earlier, due to
an internal file descriptor leak, an attacker could cause a newly-
spawned container process (from runc exec) to have a working directory
in the host filesystem namespace, allowing for a container escape by
giving access to the host filesystem ("attack 2"). The same attack
could be used by a malicious image to allow a container process to
gain access to the host filesystem through runc run ("attack 1").
Variants of attacks 1 and 2 could be also be used to overwrite semi-
arbitrary host binaries, allowing for complete container escapes
("attack 3a" and "attack 3b"). runc 1.1.12 includes patches for this
issue.

PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce platform. Prior to versions
8.1.3 and 1.7.8.11, some event attributes are not detected by the
`isCleanHTML` method. Some modules using the `isCleanHTML` method
could be vulnerable to cross-site scripting. Versions 8.1.3 and
1.7.8.11 contain a patch for this issue. The best workaround is to use
the `HTMLPurifier` library to sanitize html input coming from users.
The library is already available as a dependency in the PrestaShop
project. Beware though that in legacy object models, fields of `HTML`
type will call `isCleanHTML`.

PrestaShop is an open-source e-commerce platform. Prior to version
8.1.3, the isCleanHtml method is not used on this this form, which
makes it possible to store a cross-site scripting payload in the
database. The impact is low because the HTML is not interpreted in BO,
thanks to twig's escape mechanism. In FO, the cross-site scripting
attack is effective, but only impacts the customer sending it, or the
customer session from which it was sent. This issue affects those who
have a module fetching these messages from the DB and displaying it
without escaping HTML. Version 8.1.3 contains a patch for this issue.

Rust EVM is an Ethereum Virtual Machine interpreter. In `rust-evm`, a
feature called `record_external_operation` was introduced, allowing
library users to record custom gas changes. This feature can have some
bogus interactions with the call stack. In particular, during
finalization of a `CREATE` or `CREATE2`, in the case that the substack
execution happens successfully, `rust-evm` will first commit the
substate, and then call
`record_external_operation(Write(out_code.len()))`. If
`record_external_operation` later fails, this error is returned to the
parent call stack, instead of `Succeeded`. Yet, the substate
commitment already happened. This causes smart contracts able to
commit state changes, when the parent caller contract receives zero
address (which usually indicates that the execution has failed). This
issue only impacts library users with custom
`record_external_operation` that returns errors. The issue is patched
in release 0.41.1. No known workarounds are available.

Zulip is an open-source team collaboration tool. A vulnerability in
version 8.0 is similar to CVE-2023-32677, but applies to multi-use
invitations, not single-use invitation links as in the prior CVE.
Specifically, it applies when the installation has configured non-
admins to be able to invite users and create multi-use invitations,
and has also configured only admins to be able to invite users to
streams. As in CVE-2023-32677, this does not let users invite new
users to arbitrary streams, only to streams that the inviter can
already see. Version 8.1 fixes this issue. As a workaround,
administrators can limit sending of invitations down to users who also
have the permission to add users to streams.

Vapor is an HTTP web framework for Swift. Prior to version 4.90.0,
Vapor's `vapor_urlparser_parse` function uses `uint16_t` indexes when
parsing a URI's components, which may cause integer overflows when
parsing untrusted inputs. This vulnerability does not affect Vapor
directly but could impact applications relying on the URI type for
validating user input. The URI type is used in several places in
Vapor. A developer may decide to use URI to represent a URL in their
application (especially if that URL is then passed to the HTTP Client)
and rely on its public properties and methods. However, URI may fail
to properly parse a valid (albeit abnormally long) URL, due to string
ranges being converted to 16-bit integers. An attacker may use this
behavior to trick the application into accepting a URL to an untrusted
destination. By padding the port number with zeros, an attacker can
cause an integer overflow to occur when the URL authority is parsed
and, as a result, spoof the host. Version 4.90.0 contains a patch for
this issue. As a workaround, validate user input before parsing as a
URI or, if possible, use Foundation's `URL` and `URLComponents`
utilities.

view_component is a framework for building reusable, testable, and
encapsulated view components in Ruby on Rails. Versions prior to 3.9.0
and 2.83.0 have a cross-site scripting vulnerability that has the
potential to impact anyone rendering a component directly from a
controller with the view_component gem. Note that only components that
define a `#call` method (i.e. instead of using a sidecar template) are
affected. The return value of the `#call` method is not sanitized and
can include user-defined content. In addition, the return value of the
`#output_postamble` methodis not sanitized, which can also lead to
cross-site scripting issues. Versions 3.9.0 and 2.83.0 have been
released and fully mitigate both the `#call` and the
`#output_postamble` vulnerabilities. As a workaround, sanitize the
return value of `#call`.

Azure IPAM (IP Address Management) is a lightweight solution developed
on top of the Azure platform designed to help Azure customers manage
their IP Address space easily and effectively. By design there is no
write access to customers' Azure environments as the Service Principal
used is only assigned the Reader role at the root Management Group
level. Until recently, the solution lacked the validation of the
passed in authentication token which may result in attacker
impersonating any privileged user to access data stored within the
IPAM instance and subsequently from Azure, causing an elevation of
privilege. This vulnerability has been patched in version 3.0.0.

Puma is a web server for Ruby/Rack applications built for parallelism.
Prior to version 6.4.2, puma exhibited incorrect behavior when parsing
chunked transfer encoding bodies in a way that allowed HTTP request
smuggling. Fixed versions limits the size of chunk extensions. Without
this limit, an attacker could cause unbounded resource (CPU, network
bandwidth) consumption. This vulnerability has been fixed in versions
6.4.2 and 5.6.8.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker
can exploit a chain of vulnerabilities, including a Denial of Service
(DoS) flaw and in-memory data storage weakness, to effectively bypass
the application's brute force login protection. This is a critical
security vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass the brute force
login protection mechanism. Not only can they crash the service
affecting all users, but they can also make unlimited login attempts,
increasing the risk of account compromise. Versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and
2.10.4 contain a patch for this issue.

The vantage6 technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing
technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation
(MPC). Nodes and servers get a ssh config by default that permits root
login with password authentication. In a proper deployment, the SSH
service is not exposed so there is no risk, but not all deployments
are ideal. The default should therefore be less permissive. The
vulnerability can be mitigated by removing the ssh part from the
docker file and rebuilding the docker image. Version 4.2.0 patches the
vulnerability.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker
can exploit a critical flaw in the application to initiate a Denial of
Service (DoS) attack, rendering the application inoperable and
affecting all users. The issue arises from unsafe manipulation of an
array in a multi-threaded environment. The vulnerability is rooted in
the application's code, where an array is being modified while it is
being iterated over. This is a classic programming error but becomes
critically unsafe when executed in a multi-threaded environment. When
two threads interact with the same array simultaneously, the
application crashes. This is a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability.
Any attacker can crash the application continuously, making it
impossible for legitimate users to access the service. The issue is
exacerbated because it does not require authentication, widening the
pool of potential attackers. Versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4
contain a patch for this issue.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. Prior to versions 2.8.13, 2.9.9, and 2.10.4, an attacker
can effectively bypass the rate limit and brute force protections by
exploiting the application's weak cache-based mechanism. This loophole
in security can be combined with other vulnerabilities to attack the
default admin account. This flaw undermines a patch for CVE-2020-8827
intended to protect against brute-force attacks. The application's
brute force protection relies on a cache mechanism that tracks login
attempts for each user. This cache is limited to a
`defaultMaxCacheSize` of 1000 entries. An attacker can overflow this
cache by bombarding it with login attempts for different users,
thereby pushing out the admin account's failed attempts and
effectively resetting the rate limit for that account. This is a
severe vulnerability that enables attackers to perform brute force
attacks at an accelerated rate, especially targeting the default admin
account. Users should upgrade to version 2.8.13, 2.9.9, or 2.10.4 to
receive a patch.

react-native-mmkv is a library that allows easy use of MMKV inside
React Native applications. Before version 2.11.0, the react-native-
mmkv logged the optional encryption key for the MMKV database into the
Android system log. The key can be obtained by anyone with access to
the Android Debugging Bridge (ADB) if it is enabled in the phone
settings. This bug is not present on iOS devices. By logging the
encryption secret to the system logs, attackers can trivially recover
the secret by enabling ADB and undermining an app's thread model. This
issue has been patched in version 2.11.0.

Hyperledger Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACA-Py) is a foundation for
building decentralized identity applications and services running in
non-mobile environments. When verifying W3C Format Verifiable
Credentials using JSON-LD with Linked Data Proofs (LDP-VCs), the
result of verifying the presentation `document.proof` was not factored
into the final `verified` value (`true`/`false`) on the presentation
record. The flaw enables holders of W3C Format Verifiable Credentials
using JSON-LD with Linked Data Proofs (LDPs) to present incorrectly
constructed proofs, and allows malicious verifiers to save and replay
a presentation from such holders as their own. This vulnerability has
been present since version 0.7.0 and fixed in version 0.10.5.

Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. The
revocation schema that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures
implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees
defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model, allowing a
malicious holder of a revoked credential to generate a valid Non-
Revocation Proof for that credential as part of an AnonCreds
presentation. A verifier may verify a credential from a holder as
being "not revoked" when in fact, the holder's credential has been
revoked. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix is expected.

The Node.js Permission Model does not clarify in the documentation
that wildcards should be only used as the last character of a file
path. For example: ``` --allow-fs-read=/home/node/.ssh/*.pub ``` will
ignore `pub` and give access to everything after `.ssh/`. This

On Linux, Node.js ignores certain environment variables if those may
have been set by an unprivileged user while the process is running
with elevated privileges with the only exception of
CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE. Due to a bug in the implementation of this
exception, Node.js incorrectly applies this exception even when
certain other capabilities have been set. This allows unprivileged
users to inject code that inherits the process's elevated privileges.

The permission model protects itself against path traversal attacks by
calling path.resolve() on any paths given by the user. If the path is
to be treated as a Buffer, the implementation uses Buffer.from() to
obtain a Buffer from the result of path.resolve(). By monkey-patching
Buffer internals, namely, Buffer.prototype.utf8Write, the application
can modify the result of path.resolve(), which leads to a path
traversal vulnerability. This vulnerability affects all users using
the experimental permission model in Node.js 20 and Node.js 21. Please
note that at the time this CVE was issued, the permission model is an
experimental feature of Node.js.

A vulnerability in Node.js has been identified, allowing for a Denial
of Service (DoS) attack through resource exhaustion when using the
fetch() function to retrieve content from an untrusted URL. The
vulnerability stems from the fact that the fetch() function in Node.js
always decodes Brotli, making it possible for an attacker to cause
resource exhaustion when fetching content from an untrusted URL. An
attacker controlling the URL passed into fetch() can exploit this
vulnerability to exhaust memory, potentially leading to process
termination, depending on the system configuration.

GitPython is a python library used to interact with Git repositories.
There is an incomplete fix for CVE-2023-40590. On Windows, GitPython
uses an untrusted search path if it uses a shell to run `git`, as well
as when it runs `bash.exe` to interpret hooks. If either of those
features are used on Windows, a malicious `git.exe` or `bash.exe` may
be run from an untrusted repository. This issue has been patched in
version 3.1.41.

Avo is a framework to create admin panels for Ruby on Rails apps. A
stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability was found in the
key_value field of Avo v3.2.3 and v2.46.0. This vulnerability could
allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's
browser. The value of the key_value is inserted directly into the HTML
code. In the current version of Avo (possibly also older versions),
the value is not properly sanitized before it is inserted into the
HTML code. This vulnerability could be used to steal sensitive
information from victims that could be used to hijack victims'
accounts or redirect them to malicious websites. Avo 3.2.4 and 2.47.0
include a fix for this issue. Users are advised to upgrade.

Ursa is a cryptographic library for use with blockchains. The
revocation scheme that is part of the Ursa CL-Signatures
implementations has a flaw that could impact the privacy guarantees
defined by the AnonCreds verifiable credential model. Notably, a
malicious verifier may be able to generate a unique identifier for a
holder providing a verifiable presentation that includes a Non-
Revocation proof. The impact of the flaw is that a malicious verifier
may be able to determine a unique identifier for a holder presenting a
Non-Revocation proof. Ursa has moved to end-of-life status and no fix
is expected.

The vantage6 technology enables to manage and deploy privacy enhancing
technologies like Federated Learning (FL) and Multi-Party Computation
(MPC). There are no checks on whether the input is encrypted if a task
is created in an encrypted collaboration. Therefore, a user may
accidentally create a task with sensitive input data that will then be
stored unencrypted in a database. Users should ensure they set the
encryption setting correctly. This vulnerability is patched in 4.2.0.

cdo-local-uuid project provides a specialized UUID-generating function
that can, on user request, cause a program to generate deterministic
UUIDs. An information leakage vulnerability is present in `cdo-local-
uuid` at version `0.4.0`, and in `case-utils` in unpatched versions
(matching the pattern `0.x.0`) at and since `0.5.0`, before `0.15.0`.
The vulnerability stems from a Python function,
`cdo_local_uuid.local_uuid()`, and its original implementation
`case_utils.local_uuid()`.

Jinja is an extensible templating engine. Special placeholders in the
template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. It is possible
to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into the rendered HTML template,
potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The Jinja `xmlattr`
filter can be abused to inject arbitrary HTML attribute keys and
values, bypassing the auto escaping mechanism and potentially leading
to XSS. It may also be possible to bypass attribute validation checks
if they are blacklist-based.

attacker to spoof another user's detail, and in turn make a compelling
phishing case for removing another user's account. The front-end of
this page doesn't allow changing the form details, an attacker can
utilize a proxy to intercept this request and submit other data. Upon
submitting this form, an email is sent to the administrator informing
them that this user wants to delete their account. An administrator
has no way of telling the difference between the actual user wishing
to delete their account or the attacker issuing this for an account
they do not control. This issue has been patched in version 3.2.5.

Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. In versions prior
to 0.8.4, the `element` method in `app/routes.py` does not validate
the user-controlled `src_type` and `element_url` variables and passes
them to the `send` method which sends a GET request on lines 339-343
in `request.py`, which leads to a server-side request forgery. This
issue allows for crafting GET requests to internal and external
resources on behalf of the server. For example, this issue would allow
for accessing resources on the internal network that the server has
access to, even though these resources may not be accessible on the
internet. This issue is fixed in version 0.8.4.

Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. Versions 0.8.3 and
prior have a limited file write vulnerability when the configuration
options in Whoogle are enabled. The `config` function in
`app/routes.py` does not validate the user-controlled `name` variable
on line 447 and `config_data` variable on line 437. The `name`
variable is insecurely concatenated in `os.path.join`, leading to path
manipulation. The POST data from the `config_data` variable is saved
with `pickle.dump` which leads to a limited file write. However, the
data that is saved is earlier transformed into a dictionary and the
`url` key value pair is added before the file is saved on the system.
All in all, the issue allows us to save and overwrite files on the
system that the application has permissions to, with a dictionary
containing arbitrary data and the `url` key value, which is a limited
file write. Version 0.8.4 contains a patch for this issue.

and prior, the `window` endpoint does not sanitize user-supplied input
from the `location` variable and passes it to the `send` method which
sends a `GET` request on lines 339-343 in `request.py,` which leads to
a server-side request forgery. This issue allows for crafting GET

phpMyFAQ is an Open Source FAQ web application for PHP 8.1+ and MySQL,
PostgreSQL and other databases. The 'sharing FAQ' functionality allows
any unauthenticated actor to misuse the phpMyFAQ application to send
arbitrary emails to a large range of targets. The phpMyFAQ application
has a functionality where anyone can share a FAQ item to others. The
front-end of this functionality allows any phpMyFAQ articles to be
shared with 5 email addresses. Any unauthenticated actor can perform
this action. There is a CAPTCHA in place, however the amount of people
you email with a single request is not limited to 5 by the backend. An
attacker can thus solve a single CAPTCHA and send thousands of emails
at once. An attacker can utilize the target application's email server
to send phishing messages. This can get the server on a blacklist,
causing all emails to end up in spam. It can also lead to reputation
damages. This issue has been patched in version 3.2.5.

FreeRDP is a set of free and open source remote desktop protocol
library and clients. In affected versions an integer overflow in
`freerdp_bitmap_planar_context_reset` leads to heap-buffer overflow.
This affects FreeRDP based clients. FreeRDP based server
implementations and proxy are not affected. A malicious server could
prepare a `RDPGFX_RESET_GRAPHICS_PDU` to allocate too small buffers,
possibly triggering later out of bound read/write. Data extraction
over network is not possible, the buffers are used to display an
image. This issue has been addressed in version 2.11.5 and 3.2.0.
Users are advised to upgrade. there are no know workarounds for this

Nextcloud server is a self hosted personal cloud system. In affected
versions OAuth codes did not expire. When an attacker would get access
to an authorization code they could authenticate at any time using the
code. As of version 28.0.0 OAuth codes are invalidated after 10
minutes and will no longer be authenticated. To exploit this
vulnerability an attacker would need to intercept an OAuth code from a
user session. It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded
to 28.0.0. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

another user's profile information. The default privileges gave too
many broad permissions to low privileged users. These have been

privilege escalation for lower privileged users up to admin
privileges, potentially, if a group with admin privileges exists. May

Creditcoin is a network that enables cross-blockchain credit
transactions. The Windows binary of the Creditcoin node loads a suite
of DLLs provided by Microsoft at startup. If a malicious user has
access to overwrite the program files directory it is possible to
replace these DLLs and execute arbitrary code. It is the view of the
blockchain development team that the threat posed by a hypothetical
binary planting attack is minimal and represents a low-security risk.
The vulnerable DLL files are from the Windows networking subsystem,
the Visual C++ runtime, and low-level cryptographic primitives.
Collectively these dependencies are required for a large ecosystem of
applications, ranging from enterprise-level security applications to
game engines, and don&#8217;t represent a fundamental lack of security or
oversight in the design and implementation of Creditcoin. The
blockchain team takes the stance that running Creditcoin on Windows is
officially unsupported and at best should be thought of as
experimental.

ClickHouse is an open-source column-oriented database management
system. A bug exists in the cloud ClickHouse offering prior to version
24.0.2.54535 and in github.com/clickhouse/clickhouse version 23.1.
Query caching bypasses the role based access controls and the policies
being enforced on roles. In affected versions, the query cache only
respects separate users, however this is not documented and not
expected behavior. People relying on ClickHouse roles can have their
access control lists bypassed if they are using query caching.
Attackers who have control of a role could guess queries and see data
they shouldn't have access to. Version 24.1 of ClickHouse and version
24.0.2.54535 of ClickHouse Cloud contain a patch for this issue. Based
on the documentation, role based access control should be enforced
regardless if query caching is enabled or not.

Whoogle Search is a self-hosted metasearch engine. In versions 0.8.3
and prior, the `element` method in `app/routes.py` does not validate
the user-controlled `src_type` and `element_url` variables and passes
them to the `send` method which sends a `GET` request on lines 339-343
in `requests.py`. The returned contents of the URL are then passed to
and reflected back to the user in the `send_file` function on line
484, together with the user-controlled `src_type`, which allows the
attacker to control the HTTP response content type leading to a cross-
site scripting vulnerability. An attacker could craft a special URL to
point to a malicious website and send the link to a victim. The fact
that the link would contain a trusted domain (e.g. from one of public
Whoogle instances) could be used to trick the user into clicking the
link. The malicious website could, for example, be a copy of a real
website, meant to steal a person&#8217;s credentials to the website, or
trick that person in another way. Version 0.8.4 contains a patch for
this issue.

Vyper is a Pythonic Smart Contract Language for the Ethereum Virtual
Machine. The `concat` built-in can write over the bounds of the memory
buffer that was allocated for it and thus overwrite existing valid
data. The root cause is that the `build_IR` for `concat` doesn't
properly adhere to the API of copy functions (for `>=0.3.2` the
`copy_bytes` function). A contract search was performed and no
vulnerable contracts were found in production. The buffer overflow can
result in the change of semantics of the contract. The overflow is
length-dependent and thus it might go unnoticed during contract
testing. However, certainly not all usages of concat will result in
overwritten valid data as we require it to be in an internal function
and close to the return statement where other memory allocations don't
occur. This issue has been addressed in commit `55e18f6d1` which will
be included in future releases. Users are advised to update when
possible.

AnythingLLM is an application that turns any document, resource, or
piece of content into context that any LLM can use as references
during chatting. In versions prior to commit `08d33cfd8` an
unauthenticated API route (file export) can allow attacker to crash
the server resulting in a denial of service attack. The &#8220;data-export&#8221;
endpoint is used to export files using the filename parameter as user
input. The endpoint takes the user input, filters it to avoid
directory traversal attacks, fetches the file from the server, and
afterwards deletes it. An attacker can trick the input filter
mechanism to point to the current directory, and while attempting to
delete it the server will crash as there is no error-handling wrapper
around it. Moreover, the endpoint is public and does not require any
form of authentication, resulting in an unauthenticated Denial of
Service issue, which crashes the instance using a single HTTP packet.
This issue has been addressed in commit `08d33cfd8`. Users are advised
to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for
Kubernetes. The Argo CD API prior to versions 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8,
and 2.7.15 are vulnerable to a cross-server request forgery (CSRF)
attack when the attacker has the ability to write HTML to a page on
the same parent domain as Argo CD. A CSRF attack works by tricking an
authenticated Argo CD user into loading a web page which contains code
to call Argo CD API endpoints on the victim&#8217;s behalf. For example, an
attacker could send an Argo CD user a link to a page which looks
harmless but in the background calls an Argo CD API endpoint to create
an application running malicious code. Argo CD uses the &#8220;Lax&#8221; SameSite
cookie policy to prevent CSRF attacks where the attacker controls an
external domain. The malicious external website can attempt to call
the Argo CD API, but the web browser will refuse to send the Argo CD
auth token with the request. Many companies host Argo CD on an
internal subdomain. If an attacker can place malicious code on, for
example, https://test.internal.example.com/, they can still perform a
CSRF attack. In this case, the &#8220;Lax&#8221; SameSite cookie does not prevent
the browser from sending the auth cookie, because the destination is a
parent domain of the Argo CD API. Browsers generally block such
attacks by applying CORS policies to sensitive requests with sensitive
content types. Specifically, browsers will send a &#8220;preflight request&#8221;
for POSTs with content type &#8220;application/json&#8221; asking the destination
API &#8220;are you allowed to accept requests from my domain?&#8221; If the
destination API does not answer &#8220;yes,&#8221; the browser will block the
request. Before the patched versions, Argo CD did not validate that
requests contained the correct content type header. So an attacker
could bypass the browser&#8217;s CORS check by setting the content type to
something which is considered &#8220;not sensitive&#8221; such as &#8220;text/plain.&#8221;
The browser wouldn&#8217;t send the preflight request, and Argo CD would
happily accept the contents (which are actually still JSON) and
perform the requested action (such as running malicious code). A patch
for this vulnerability has been released in the following Argo CD
versions: 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15. The patch contains a
breaking API change. The Argo CD API will no longer accept non-GET
requests which do not specify application/json as their Content-Type.
The accepted content types list is configurable, and it is possible
(but discouraged) to disable the content type check completely. Users
are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this
vulnerability.
