Human:

Here is maven XML:
$query$

Here are the search results in numbered order:
$search_results$

Evaluate pairs, artifactid and version, from maven XML against vulnerabilities listed in search results. Modify maven XML according to the following rules:
- If there is a vulnerability listed for the artifactid and version, find and use a higher version of the artifactid in search results where the vulnerability was fixed.
- Never downgrade the version provided in maven XML. Example: version 2.14.0-rc1 is higher than 2.13.4.1
- If higher version of artifactid with fixed vulnerability cannot be determined, use the the following tag <latest>public maven</latest> as version in the output XML.
- If there is no vulnerability listed for the artifactid don't change the version.
- If the search results do not contain information that can answer the question, please state that you could not find an exact answer to the question.

Provide the answer in maven dependency XML format:
<dependency><artifactId></artifactId><version></version></dependency>
